N._Jhn1_22="Finally they said, \"Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\"";
N._Jhn1_23="John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, \"I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.' \"";
N._Jhn1_24="Now some Pharisees who had been sent";
N._Jhn1_25="questioned him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\"";
N._Jhn1_26="\"I baptize with water,\" John replied, \"but among you stands one you do not know.";
N._Jhn1_27="He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.\"";
N._Jhn1_28="This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.";
N._Jhn1_29="The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!";
N._Jhn1_30="This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'";
N._Jhn1_31="I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.\"";
N._Jhn1_32="Then John gave this testimony: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.";
N._Jhn1_33="I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'";
N._Jhn1_34="I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.\"";
N._Jhn1_35="The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.";
N._Jhn1_36="When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the Lamb of God!\"";
N._Jhn1_37="When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.";
N._Jhn1_38="Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, \"What do you want?\" They said, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher), \"where are you staying?\"";
N._Jhn1_39="\"Come,\" he replied, \"and you will see.\" So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour.";
N._Jhn1_40="Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.";
N._Jhn1_41="The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (that is, the Christ).";
N._Jhn1_42="And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \"You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\" (which, when translated, is Peter ).";
N._Jhn1_43="The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, \"Follow me.\"";
N._Jhn1_44="Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.";
N._Jhn1_45="Philip found Nathanael and told him, \"We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote -- Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\"";
N._Jhn1_46="\"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" Nathanael asked. \"Come and see,\" said Philip.";
N._Jhn1_47="When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, \"Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.\"";
N._Jhn1_48="\"How do you know me?\" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, \"I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.\"";
N._Jhn1_49="Then Nathanael declared, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.\"";
N._Jhn1_50="Jesus said, \"You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.\"";
N._Jhn1_51="He then added, \"I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.\"";
N._Jhn2_1="On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there,";
N._Jhn2_2="and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.";
N._Jhn2_3="When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, \"They have no more wine.\"";
N._Jhn2_4="\"Dear woman, why do you involve me?\" Jesus replied, \"My time has not yet come.\"";
N._Jhn2_5="His mother said to the servants, \"Do whatever he tells you.\"";
N._Jhn2_6="Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.";
N._Jhn2_7="Jesus said to the servants, \"Fill the jars with water\"; so they filled them to the brim.";
N._Jhn2_8="Then he told them, \"Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.\"";
N._Jhn2_9="They did so, and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside";
N._Jhn2_10="and said, \"Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.\"";
N._Jhn2_11="This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. He thus revealed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him.";
N._Jhn2_12="After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days.";
N._Jhn2_13="When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.";
N._Jhn2_14="In the temple courts he found men selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.";
N._Jhn2_15="So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.";
N._Jhn2_16="To those who sold doves he said, \"Get these out of here! How dare you turn my Father's house into a market!\"";
N._Jhn2_17="His disciples remembered that it is written: \"Zeal for your house will consume me.\"";
N._Jhn2_18="Then the Jews demanded of him, \"What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?\"";
N._Jhn2_19="Jesus answered them, \"Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.\"";
N._Jhn2_20="The Jews replied, \"It has taken fortysix years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?\"";
N._Jhn2_21="But the temple he had spoken of was his body.";
N._Jhn2_22="After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.";
N._Jhn2_23="Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw the miraculous signs he was doing and believed in his name.";
N._Jhn2_24="But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all men.";
N._Jhn2_25="He did not need man's testimony about man, for he knew what was in a man.";
N._Jhn3_1="Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council.";
N._Jhn3_2="He came to Jesus at night and said, \"Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him.\"";
N._Jhn3_3="In reply Jesus declared, \"I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. \"";
N._Jhn3_4="\"How can a man be born when he is old?\" Nicodemus asked. \"Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!\"";
N._Jhn3_5="Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.";
N._Jhn3_6="Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.";
N._Jhn3_7="You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.'";
N._Jhn3_8="The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\"";
N._Jhn3_9="\"How can this be?\" Nicodemus asked.";
N._Jhn3_10="\"You are Israel's teacher,\" said Jesus, \"and do you not understand these things?";
N._Jhn3_11="I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.";
N._Jhn3_12="I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?";
N._Jhn3_13="No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven-- the Son of Man.";
N._Jhn3_14="Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,";
N._Jhn3_15="that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.";
N._Jhn3_16="\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.";
N._Jhn3_17="For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.";
N._Jhn3_18="Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.";
N._Jhn3_19="This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.";
N._Jhn3_20="Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.";
N._Jhn3_21="But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\"";
N._Jhn3_22="After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized.";
N._Jhn3_23="Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized.";
N._Jhn3_24="(This was before John was put in prison.)";
N._Jhn3_25="An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing.";
N._Jhn3_26="They came to John and said to him, \"Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan -- the one you testified about -- well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.\"";
N._Jhn3_27="To this John replied, \"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven.";
N._Jhn3_28="You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.'";
N._Jhn3_29="The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.";
N._Jhn3_30="He must become greater; I must become less.";
N._Jhn3_31="\"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all.";
N._Jhn3_32="He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.";
N._Jhn3_33="The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful.";
N._Jhn3_34="For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit.";
N._Jhn3_35="The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.";
N._Jhn3_36="Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\"";
N._Jhn4_1="The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John,";
N._Jhn4_2="although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples.";
N._Jhn4_3="When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.";
N._Jhn4_4="Now he had to go through Samaria.";
N._Jhn4_5="So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.";
N._Jhn4_6="Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.";
N._Jhn4_7="When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, \"Will you give me a drink?\"";
N._Jhn4_8="(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)";
N._Jhn4_9="The Samaritan woman said to him, \"You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?\" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans. )";
N._Jhn4_10="Jesus answered her, \"If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.\"";
N._Jhn4_11="\"Sir,\" the woman said, \"you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water?";
N._Jhn4_12="Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?\"";
N._Jhn4_13="Jesus answered, \"Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,";
N._Jhn4_14="but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\"";
N._Jhn4_15="The woman said to him, \"Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.\"";
N._Jhn4_16="He told her, \"Go, call your husband and come back.\"";
N._Jhn4_17="\"I have no husband,\" she replied.";
N._Jhn4_18="Jesus said to her, \"You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.\"";
N._Jhn4_19="\"Sir,\" the woman said, \"I can see that you are a prophet.";
N._Jhn4_20="Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.\"";
N._Jhn4_21="Jesus declared, \"Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.";
N._Jhn4_22="You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.";
N._Jhn4_23="Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.";
N._Jhn4_24="God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.\"";
N._Jhn4_25="The woman said, \"I know that Messiah\" (called Christ) \"is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.\"";
N._Jhn4_26="Then Jesus declared, \"I who speak to you am he.\"";
N._Jhn4_27="Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, \"What do you want?\" or \"Why are you talking with her?\"";
N._Jhn4_28="Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people,";
N._Jhn4_29="\"Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ ?\"";
N._Jhn4_30="They came out of the town and made their way toward him.";
N._Jhn4_31="Meanwhile his disciples urged him, \"Rabbi, eat something.\"";
N._Jhn4_32="But he said to them, \"I have food to eat that you know nothing about.\"";
N._Jhn4_33="Then his disciples said to each other, \"Could someone have brought him food?\"";
N._Jhn4_34="\"My food,\" said Jesus, \"is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.";
N._Jhn4_35="Do you not say, 'Four months more and then the harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.";
N._Jhn4_36="Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.";
N._Jhn4_37="Thus the saying 'One sows and another reaps' is true.";
N._Jhn4_38="I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.\"";
N._Jhn4_39="Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, \"He told me everything I ever did.\"";
N._Jhn4_40="So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.";
N._Jhn4_41="And because of his words many more became believers.";
N._Jhn4_42="They said to the woman, \"We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.\"";
N._Jhn4_43="After the two days he left for Galilee.";
N._Jhn4_44="(Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.)";
N._Jhn4_45="When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there.";
N._Jhn4_46="Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.";
N._Jhn4_47="When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.";
N._Jhn4_48="\"Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders,\" Jesus told him, \"you will never believe.\"";
N._Jhn4_49="The royal official said, \"Sir, come down before my child dies.\"";
N._Jhn4_50="Jesus replied, \"You may go. Your son will live.\" The man took Jesus at his word and departed.";
N._Jhn4_51="While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.";
N._Jhn4_52="When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, \"The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.\"";
N._Jhn4_53="Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, \"Your son will live.\" So he and all his household believed.";
N._Jhn4_54="This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.";
N._Jhn5_1="Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.";
N._Jhn5_2="Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.";
N._Jhn5_3="Here a great number of disabled people used to lie -- the blind, the lame, the paralyzed.";
N._Jhn5_4="[mismatch#11.]";
N._Jhn5_5="One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.";
N._Jhn5_6="When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, \"Do you want to get well?\"";
N._Jhn5_7="\"Sir,\" the invalid replied, \"I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.\"";
N._Jhn5_8="Then Jesus said to him, \"Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.\"";
N._Jhn5_9="At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,";
N._Jhn5_10="and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, \"It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.\"";
N._Jhn5_11="But he replied, \"The man who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.' \"";
N._Jhn5_12="So they asked him, \"Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?\"";
N._Jhn5_13="The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.";
N._Jhn5_14="Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, \"See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.\"";
N._Jhn5_15="The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.";
N._Jhn5_16="So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him.";
N._Jhn5_17="Jesus said to them, \"My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working.\"";
N._Jhn5_18="For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.";
N._Jhn5_19="Jesus gave them this answer: \"I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.";
N._Jhn5_20="For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these.";
N._Jhn5_21="For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.";
N._Jhn5_22="Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,";
N._Jhn5_23="that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.";
N._Jhn5_24="\"I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life.";
N._Jhn5_25="I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.";
N._Jhn5_26="For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself.";
N._Jhn5_27="And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.";
N._Jhn5_28="\"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice";
N._Jhn5_29="and come out -- those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.";
N._Jhn5_30="By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.";
N._Jhn5_31="\"If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid.";
N._Jhn5_32="There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is valid.";
N._Jhn5_33="\"You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.";
N._Jhn5_34="Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved.";
N._Jhn5_35="John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.";
N._Jhn5_36="\"I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me.";
N._Jhn5_37="And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form,";
N._Jhn5_38="nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.";
N._Jhn5_39="You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me,";

N._Jhn5_41="\"I do not accept praise from men,";
N._Jhn5_42="but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.";
N._Jhn5_43="I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.";
N._Jhn5_44="How can you believe if you accept praise from one another, yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the only God ?";
N._Jhn5_45="\"But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set.";
N._Jhn5_46="If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.";
N._Jhn5_47="But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?\"";
N._Jhn6_1="Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias),";
N._Jhn6_2="and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick.";
N._Jhn6_3="Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples.";
N._Jhn6_4="The Jewish Passover Feast was near.";
N._Jhn6_5="When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, \"Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?\"";
N._Jhn6_6="He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do.";
N._Jhn6_7="Philip answered him, \"Eight months' wages would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!\"";
N._Jhn6_8="Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up,";
N._Jhn6_9="\"Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?\"";
N._Jhn6_10="Jesus said, \"Have the people sit down.\" There was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, about five thousand of them.";
N._Jhn6_11="Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.";
N._Jhn6_12="When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, \"Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.\"";
N._Jhn6_13="So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.";
N._Jhn6_14="After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to say, \"Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.\"";
N._Jhn6_15="Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.";
N._Jhn6_16="When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake,";
N._Jhn6_17="where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.";
N._Jhn6_18="A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough.";
N._Jhn6_19="When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified.";
N._Jhn6_20="But he said to them, \"It is I; don't be afraid.\"";
N._Jhn6_21="Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.";
N._Jhn6_22="The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone.";
N._Jhn6_23="Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.";
N._Jhn6_24="Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.";
N._Jhn6_25="When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, \"Rabbi, when did you get here?\"";
N._Jhn6_26="Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, you are looking for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.";
N._Jhn6_27="Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.\"";
N._Jhn6_28="Then they asked him, \"What must we do to do the works God requires?\"";
N._Jhn6_29="Jesus answered, \"The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.\"";

N._Jhn6_39="And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.";
N._Jhn6_40="For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\"";
N._Jhn6_41="At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, \"I am the bread that came down from heaven.\"";

N._Jhn6_59="He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.";
