N._2Sa10_5="When David was told about this, he sent messengers to meet the men, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, \"Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back.\"";
N._2Sa10_6="When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench in David's nostrils, they hired twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers from Beth Rehob and Zobah, as well as the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and also twelve thousand men from Tob.";
N._2Sa10_7="On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men.";

N._2Sa10_18="But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven hundred of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also struck down Shobach the commander of their army, and he died there.";
N._2Sa10_19="When all the kings who were vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with the Israelites and became subject to them. So the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore.";
N._2Sa11_1="In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, David sent Joab out with the king's men and the whole Israelite army. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem.";
N._2Sa11_2="One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful,";
N._2Sa11_3="and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, \"Isn't this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite?\"";
N._2Sa11_4="Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept with her. (She had purified herself from her uncleanness.) Then she went back home.";
N._2Sa11_5="The woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, \"I am pregnant.\"";
N._2Sa11_6="So David sent this word to Joab: \"Send me Uriah the Hittite.\" And Joab sent him to David.";
N._2Sa11_7="When Uriah came to him, David asked him how Joab was, how the soldiers were and how the war was going.";
N._2Sa11_8="Then David said to Uriah, \"Go down to your house and wash your feet.\" So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king was sent after him.";
N._2Sa11_9="But Uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his master's servants and did not go down to his house.";

N._2Sa11_11="Uriah said to David, \"The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents, and my master Joab and my lord's men are camped in the open fields. How could I go to my house to eat and drink and lie with my wife? As surely as you live, I will not do such a thing!\"";
N._2Sa11_12="Then David said to him, \"Stay here one more day, and tomorrow I will send you back.\" So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.";
N._2Sa11_13="At David's invitation, he ate and drank with him, and David made him drunk. But in the evening Uriah went out to sleep on his mat among his master's servants; he did not go home.";

N._2Sa11_15="In it he wrote, \"Put Uriah in the front line where the fighting is fiercest. Then withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die.\"";

N._2Sa11_17="When the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, some of the men in David's army fell; moreover, Uriah the Hittite died.";
N._2Sa11_18="Joab sent David a full account of the battle.";

N._2Sa11_21="Who killed Abimelech son of Jerub- Besheth ? Didn't a woman throw an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you get so close to the wall?' If he asks you this, then say to him, 'Also, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.' \"";
N._2Sa11_22="The messenger set out, and when he arrived he told David everything Joab had sent him to say.";
N._2Sa11_23="The messenger said to David, \"The men overpowered us and came out against us in the open, but we drove them back to the entrance to the city gate.";

N._2Sa11_25="David told the messenger, \"Say this to Joab: 'Don't let this upset you; the sword devours one as well as another. Press the attack against the city and destroy it.' Say this to encourage Joab.\"";
N._2Sa11_26="When Uriah's wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him.";
N._2Sa11_27="After the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing David had done displeased the Lord .";
N._2Sa12_1="The Lord sent Nathan to David. When he came to him, he said, \"There were two men in a certain town, one rich and the other poor.";
N._2Sa12_2="The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle,";
N._2Sa12_3="but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him.";
N._2Sa12_4="\"Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him.\"";
N._2Sa12_5="David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, \"As surely as the Lord lives, the man who did this deserves to die!";
N._2Sa12_6="He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity.\"";
N._2Sa12_7="Then Nathan said to David, \"You are the man! This is what the Lord , the God of Israel, says: 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.";
N._2Sa12_8="I gave your master's house to you, and your master's wives into your arms. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if all this had been too little, I would have given you even more.";
N._2Sa12_9="Why did you despise the word of the Lord by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.";
N._2Sa12_10="Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.'";
N._2Sa12_11="\"This is what the Lord says: 'Out of your own household I am going to bring calamity upon you. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you, and he will lie with your wives in broad daylight.";

N._2Sa12_13="Then David said to Nathan, \"I have sinned against the Lord .\" Nathan replied, \"The Lord has taken away your sin. You are not going to die.";

N._2Sa12_17="The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused, and he would not eat any food with them.";
N._2Sa12_18="On the seventh day the child died. David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, \"While the child was still living, we spoke to David but he would not listen to us. How can we tell him the child is dead? He may do something desperate.\"";
N._2Sa12_19="David noticed that his servants were whispering among themselves and he realized the child was dead. \"Is the child dead?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" they replied, \"he is dead.\"";

N._2Sa12_23="But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.\"";
N._2Sa12_24="Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and lay with her. She gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon. The Lord loved him;";

N._2Sa13_17="He called his personal servant and said, \"Get this woman out of here and bolt the door after her.\"";

N._2Sa14_3="Then go to the king and speak these words to him.\" And Joab put the words in her mouth.";
N._2Sa14_4="When the woman from Tekoa went to the king, she fell with her face to the ground to pay him honor, and she said, \"Help me, O king!\"";
N._2Sa14_5="The king asked her, \"What is troubling you?\" She said, \"I am indeed a widow; my husband is dead.";
