N._Act16_2="The brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.";

N._Act16_13="On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.";
N._Act16_14="One of those listening was a woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message.";

N._Act17_10="As soon as it was night, the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue.";
N._Act17_11="Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.";
N._Act17_12="Many of the Jews believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.";
N._Act17_13="When the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, they went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up.";

N._Act17_18="A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him. Some of them asked, \"What is this babbler trying to say?\" Others remarked, \"He seems to be advocating foreign gods.\" They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.";

N._Act17_34="A few men became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.";

N._Act18_2="There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them,";

N._Act18_4="Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.";
N._Act18_5="When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.";
N._Act18_6="But when the Jews opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, \"Your blood be on your own heads! I am clear of my responsibility. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.\"";

N._Act18_8="Crispus, the synagogue ruler, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized.";
N._Act18_9="One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: \"Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent.";
N._Act18_10="For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city.\"";
N._Act18_11="So Paul stayed for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.";
N._Act18_12="While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him into court.";
N._Act18_13="\"This man,\" they charged, \"is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law.\"";

N._Act18_16="So he had them ejected from the court.";
N._Act18_17="Then they all turned on Sosthenes the synagogue ruler and beat him in front of the court. But Gallio showed no concern whatever.";
N._Act18_18="Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchrea because of a vow he had taken.";
N._Act18_19="They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.";
N._Act18_20="When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined.";

N._Act18_27="When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On arriving, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed.";

N._Act19_3="So Paul asked, \"Then what baptism did you receive?\" \"John's baptism,\" they replied.";
N._Act19_4="Paul said, \"John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.\"";

N._Act19_8="Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God.";
N._Act19_9="But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.";

N._Act19_11="God did extraordinary miracles through Paul,";
N._Act19_12="so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.";
N._Act19_13="Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, \"In the name of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.\"";
