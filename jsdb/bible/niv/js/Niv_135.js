N._Col4_9="He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here.";
N._Col4_10="My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.)";

N._1Ts1_3="We continually remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.";
N._1Ts1_4="For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you,";
N._1Ts1_5="because our gospel came to you not simply with words, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your sake.";
N._1Ts1_6="You became imitators of us and of the Lord; in spite of severe suffering, you welcomed the message with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.";
N._1Ts1_7="And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.";
N._1Ts1_8="The Lord's message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia -- your faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need to say anything about it,";
N._1Ts1_9="for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,";
N._1Ts1_10="and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead -- Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.";
N._1Ts2_1="You know, brothers, that our visit to you was not a failure.";
N._1Ts2_2="We had previously suffered and been insulted in Philippi, as you know, but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in spite of strong opposition.";
N._1Ts2_3="For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you.";
N._1Ts2_4="On the contrary, we speak as men approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please men but God, who tests our hearts.";
N._1Ts2_5="You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed -- God is our witness.";
N._1Ts2_6="We were not looking for praise from men, not from you or anyone else.";
N._1Ts2_7="As apostles of Christ we could have been a burden to you, but we were gentle among you, like a mother caring for her little children.";
N._1Ts2_8="We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us.";
N._1Ts2_9="Surely you remember, brothers, our toil and hardship; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you.";
N._1Ts2_10="You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous and blameless we were among you who believed.";
N._1Ts2_11="For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children,";
N._1Ts2_12="encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.";
N._1Ts2_13="And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.";
N._1Ts2_14="For you, brothers, became imitators of God's churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own countrymen the same things those churches suffered from the Jews,";
N._1Ts2_15="who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to all men";
N._1Ts2_16="in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last.";
N._1Ts2_17="But, brothers, when we were torn away from you for a short time (in person, not in thought), out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you.";
N._1Ts2_18="For we wanted to come to you-- certainly I, Paul, did, again and again-- but Satan stopped us.";
N._1Ts2_19="For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?";
N._1Ts2_20="Indeed, you are our glory and joy.";
N._1Ts3_1="So when we could stand it no longer, we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens.";
N._1Ts3_2="We sent Timothy, who is our brother and God's fellow worker in spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,";
N._1Ts3_3="so that no one would be unsettled by these trials. You know quite well that we were destined for them.";
N._1Ts3_4="In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know.";
N._1Ts3_5="For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter might have tempted you and our efforts might have been useless.";
N._1Ts3_6="But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love. He has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us, just as we also long to see you.";
N._1Ts3_7="Therefore, brothers, in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith.";
N._1Ts3_8="For now we really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord.";
N._1Ts3_9="How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you?";
N._1Ts3_10="Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith.";
N._1Ts3_11="Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you.";
N._1Ts3_12="May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you.";
N._1Ts3_13="May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones.";
N._1Ts4_1="Finally, brothers, we instructed you how to live in order to please God, as in fact you are living. Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more.";
N._1Ts4_2="For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.";
N._1Ts4_3="It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality;";
N._1Ts4_4="that each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable,";
N._1Ts4_5="not in passionate lust like the heathen, who do not know God;";
N._1Ts4_6="and that in this matter no one should wrong his brother or take advantage of him. The Lord will punish men for all such sins, as we have already told you and warned you.";
N._1Ts4_7="For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life.";
N._1Ts4_8="Therefore, he who rejects this instruction does not reject man but God, who gives you his Holy Spirit.";
N._1Ts4_9="Now about brotherly love we do not need to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other.";
N._1Ts4_10="And in fact, you do love all the brothers throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers, to do so more and more.";
N._1Ts4_11="Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business and to work with your hands, just as we told you,";
N._1Ts4_12="so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.";
N._1Ts4_13="Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep, or to grieve like the rest of men, who have no hope.";
N._1Ts4_14="We believe that Jesus died and rose again and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.";
N._1Ts4_15="According to the Lord's own word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.";
N._1Ts4_16="For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.";
N._1Ts4_17="After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.";
N._1Ts4_18="Therefore encourage each other with these words.";
N._1Ts5_1="Now, brothers, about times and dates we do not need to write to you,";
N._1Ts5_2="for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.";
N._1Ts5_3="While people are saying, \"Peace and safety,\" destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.";
N._1Ts5_4="But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief.";
N._1Ts5_5="You are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.";
N._1Ts5_6="So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be alert and selfcontrolled.";
N._1Ts5_7="For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.";
N._1Ts5_8="But since we belong to the day, let us be self-controlled, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.";
N._1Ts5_9="For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.";
N._1Ts5_10="He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.";
N._1Ts5_11="Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.";
N._1Ts5_12="Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who work hard among you, who are over you in the Lord and who admonish you.";
N._1Ts5_13="Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other.";
N._1Ts5_14="And we urge you, brothers, warn those who are idle, encourage the timid, help the weak, be patient with everyone.";
N._1Ts5_15="Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always try to be kind to each other and to everyone else.";
N._1Ts5_16="Be joyful always;";
N._1Ts5_17="pray continually;";
N._1Ts5_18="give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.";
N._1Ts5_19="Do not put out the Spirit's fire;";
N._1Ts5_20="do not treat prophecies with contempt.";
N._1Ts5_21="Test everything. Hold on to the good.";
N._1Ts5_22="Avoid every kind of evil.";
N._1Ts5_23="May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.";
N._1Ts5_24="The one who calls you is faithful and he will do it.";
N._1Ts5_25="Brothers, pray for us.";
N._1Ts5_26="Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.";
N._1Ts5_27="I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.";
N._1Ts5_28="The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.";
N._2Ts1_1="Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:";
N._2Ts1_2="Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.";
N._2Ts1_3="We ought always to thank God for you, brothers, and rightly so, because your faith is growing more and more, and the love every one of you has for each other is increasing.";
N._2Ts1_4="Therefore, among God's churches we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring.";
N._2Ts1_5="All this is evidence that God's judgment is right, and as a result you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are suffering.";
N._2Ts1_6="God is just: He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you";
N._2Ts1_7="and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels.";
N._2Ts1_8="He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.";
N._2Ts1_9="They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of his power";
N._2Ts1_10="on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed. This includes you, because you believed our testimony to you.";
N._2Ts1_11="With this in mind, we constantly pray for you, that our God may count you worthy of his calling, and that by his power he may fulfill every good purpose of yours and every act prompted by your faith.";
N._2Ts1_12="We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.";
N._2Ts2_1="Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers,";
N._2Ts2_2="not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by some prophecy, report or letter supposed to have come from us, saying that the day of the Lord has already come.";
N._2Ts2_3="Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction.";
N._2Ts2_4="He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God's temple, proclaiming himself to be God.";
N._2Ts2_5="Don't you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things?";
N._2Ts2_6="And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time.";
N._2Ts2_7="For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.";
N._2Ts2_8="And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.";
N._2Ts2_9="The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs and wonders,";
N._2Ts2_10="and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.";
N._2Ts2_11="For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie";
N._2Ts2_12="and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.";
N._2Ts2_13="But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God chose you to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.";
N._2Ts2_14="He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.";
N._2Ts2_15="So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the teachings we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.";
N._2Ts2_16="May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,";
N._2Ts2_17="encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.";
N._2Ts3_1="Finally, brothers, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you.";
N._2Ts3_2="And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men, for not everyone has faith.";
N._2Ts3_3="But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.";
N._2Ts3_4="We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we command.";
N._2Ts3_5="May the Lord direct your hearts into God's love and Christ's perseverance.";
N._2Ts3_6="In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers, to keep away from every brother who is idle and does not live according to the teaching you received from us.";
N._2Ts3_7="For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you,";
N._2Ts3_8="nor did we eat anyone's food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you.";
N._2Ts3_9="We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to make ourselves a model for you to follow.";
N._2Ts3_10="For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: \"If a man will not work, he shall not eat.\"";
N._2Ts3_11="We hear that some among you are idle. They are not busy; they are busybodies.";
N._2Ts3_12="Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the bread they eat.";
N._2Ts3_13="And as for you, brothers, never tire of doing what is right.";
N._2Ts3_14="If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of him. Do not associate with him, in order that he may feel ashamed.";
N._2Ts3_15="Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.";
N._2Ts3_16="Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.";
N._2Ts3_17="I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand, which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters. This is how I write.";
N._2Ts3_18="The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.";
N._1Ti1_1="Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,";
N._1Ti1_2="To Timothy my true son in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.";
N._1Ti1_3="As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain men not to teach false doctrines any longer";
N._1Ti1_4="nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. These promote controversies rather than God's work-- which is by faith.";
N._1Ti1_5="The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.";
N._1Ti1_6="Some have wandered away from these and turned to meaningless talk.";
N._1Ti1_7="They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm.";
N._1Ti1_8="We know that the law is good if one uses it properly.";
N._1Ti1_9="We also know that law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious; for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,";
N._1Ti1_10="for adulterers and perverts, for slave traders and liars and perjurers -- and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine";
N._1Ti1_11="that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.";
N._1Ti1_12="I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me faithful, appointing me to his service.";
N._1Ti1_13="Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.";
N._1Ti1_14="The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.";
N._1Ti1_15="Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners -- of whom I am the worst.";
N._1Ti1_16="But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life.";
N._1Ti1_17="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.";
N._1Ti1_18="Timothy, my son, I give you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies once made about you, so that by following them you may fight the good fight,";
N._1Ti1_19="holding on to faith and a good conscience. Some have rejected these and so have shipwrecked their faith.";
N._1Ti1_20="Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.";
N._1Ti2_1="I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone--";
N._1Ti2_2="for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.";
N._1Ti2_3="This is good, and pleases God our Savior,";
N._1Ti2_4="who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.";
N._1Ti2_5="For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,";
N._1Ti2_6="who gave himself as a ransom for all men -- the testimony given in its proper time.";
N._1Ti2_7="And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle -- I am telling the truth, I am not lying -- and a teacher of the true faith to the Gentiles.";
N._1Ti2_8="I want men everywhere to lift up holy hands in prayer, without anger or disputing.";
N._1Ti2_9="I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,";
N._1Ti2_10="but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.";
N._1Ti2_11="A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.";
N._1Ti2_12="I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.";
N._1Ti2_13="For Adam was formed first, then Eve.";
N._1Ti2_14="And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.";
N._1Ti2_15="But women will be saved through childbearing -- if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.";
N._1Ti3_1="Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone sets his heart on being an overseer, he desires a noble task.";
N._1Ti3_2="Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,";
N._1Ti3_3="not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.";
N._1Ti3_4="He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect.";
N._1Ti3_5="(If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?)";
N._1Ti3_6="He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil.";
N._1Ti3_7="He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap.";
N._1Ti3_8="Deacons, likewise, are to be men worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain.";
N._1Ti3_9="They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.";
N._1Ti3_10="They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.";
N._1Ti3_11="In the same way, their wives are to be women worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything.";
N._1Ti3_12="A deacon must be the husband of but one wife and must manage his children and his household well.";
N._1Ti3_13="Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.";
N._1Ti3_14="Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that,";
N._1Ti3_15="if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.";
N._1Ti3_16="Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great: He appeared in a body, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.";
N._1Ti4_1="The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.";
N._1Ti4_2="Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.";
N._1Ti4_3="They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth.";
N._1Ti4_4="For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,";
N._1Ti4_5="because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.";
N._1Ti4_6="If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, brought up in the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.";
N._1Ti4_7="Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself to be godly.";
N._1Ti4_8="For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.";
N._1Ti4_9="This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance";
N._1Ti4_10="(and for this we labor and strive), that we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, and especially of those who believe.";
N._1Ti4_11="Command and teach these things.";
N._1Ti4_12="Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity.";
