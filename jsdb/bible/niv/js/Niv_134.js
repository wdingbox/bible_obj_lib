N._Eph4_14="Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming.";
N._Eph4_15="Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ.";
N._Eph4_16="From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.";
N._Eph4_17="So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.";
N._Eph4_18="They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.";
N._Eph4_19="Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more.";
N._Eph4_20="You, however, did not come to know Christ that way.";
N._Eph4_21="Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.";
N._Eph4_22="You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;";
N._Eph4_23="to be made new in the attitude of your minds;";
N._Eph4_24="and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.";
N._Eph4_25="Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body.";
N._Eph4_26="\"In your anger do not sin\" : Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry,";
N._Eph4_27="and do not give the devil a foothold.";
N._Eph4_28="He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with his own hands, that he may have something to share with those in need.";
N._Eph4_29="Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.";
N._Eph4_30="And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.";
N._Eph4_31="Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.";
N._Eph4_32="Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.";
N._Eph5_1="Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children";
N._Eph5_2="and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.";
N._Eph5_3="But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people.";
N._Eph5_4="Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.";
N._Eph5_5="For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person -- such a man is an idolater -- has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.";
N._Eph5_6="Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.";
N._Eph5_7="Therefore do not be partners with them.";
N._Eph5_8="For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light";
N._Eph5_9="(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth)";
N._Eph5_10="and find out what pleases the Lord.";
N._Eph5_11="Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.";
N._Eph5_12="For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.";
N._Eph5_13="But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,";
N._Eph5_14="for it is light that makes everything visible. This is why it is said: \"Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.\"";
N._Eph5_15="Be very careful, then, how you live-- not as unwise but as wise,";
N._Eph5_16="making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.";
N._Eph5_17="Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.";
N._Eph5_18="Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.";
N._Eph5_19="Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord,";
N._Eph5_20="always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.";
N._Eph5_21="Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.";
N._Eph5_22="Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.";
N._Eph5_23="For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.";
N._Eph5_24="Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.";
N._Eph5_25="Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her";
N._Eph5_26="to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,";
N._Eph5_27="and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.";
N._Eph5_28="In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.";
N._Eph5_29="After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church--";
N._Eph5_30="for we are members of his body.";
N._Eph5_31="\"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\"";
N._Eph5_32="This is a profound mystery -- but I am talking about Christ and the church.";
N._Eph5_33="However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.";
N._Eph6_1="Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.";
N._Eph6_2="\"Honor your father and mother\"--which is the first commandment with a promise--";
N._Eph6_3="\"that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.\"";
N._Eph6_4="Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.";
N._Eph6_5="Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.";
N._Eph6_6="Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.";
N._Eph6_7="Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men,";
N._Eph6_8="because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free.";
N._Eph6_9="And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.";
N._Eph6_10="Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.";
N._Eph6_11="Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.";
N._Eph6_12="For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.";
N._Eph6_13="Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.";
N._Eph6_14="Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,";
N._Eph6_15="and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.";
N._Eph6_16="In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.";
N._Eph6_17="Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.";
N._Eph6_18="And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.";
N._Eph6_19="Pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,";
N._Eph6_20="for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.";
N._Eph6_21="Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything, so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing.";
N._Eph6_22="I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage you.";
N._Eph6_23="Peace to the brothers, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.";
N._Eph6_24="Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.";
N._Phl1_1="Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons:";
N._Phl1_2="Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.";
N._Phl1_3="I thank my God every time I remember you.";
N._Phl1_4="In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy";
N._Phl1_5="because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,";
N._Phl1_6="being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.";
N._Phl1_7="It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart; for whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me.";
N._Phl1_8="God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.";
N._Phl1_9="And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight,";
N._Phl1_10="so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,";
N._Phl1_11="filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ -- to the glory and praise of God.";
N._Phl1_12="Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel.";
N._Phl1_13="As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.";
N._Phl1_14="Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly.";
N._Phl1_15="It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.";
N._Phl1_16="The latter do so in love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.";
N._Phl1_17="The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains.";
N._Phl1_18="But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.";
N._Phl1_19="Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, for I know that through your prayers and the help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.";
N._Phl1_20="I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.";
N._Phl1_21="For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.";
N._Phl1_22="If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know!";
N._Phl1_23="I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far;";
N._Phl1_24="but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.";
N._Phl1_25="Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,";
N._Phl1_26="so that through my being with you again your joy in Christ Jesus will overflow on account of me.";
N._Phl1_27="Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending as one man for the faith of the gospel";
N._Phl1_28="without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved -- and that by God.";
N._Phl1_29="For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him,";
N._Phl1_30="since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.";
N._Phl2_1="If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion,";
N._Phl2_2="then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose.";
N._Phl2_3="Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves.";
N._Phl2_4="Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.";
N._Phl2_5="Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:";
N._Phl2_6="Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,";
N._Phl2_7="but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.";
N._Phl2_8="And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death-- even death on a cross!";
N._Phl2_9="Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name,";
N._Phl2_10="that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,";
N._Phl2_11="and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.";
N._Phl2_12="Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed -- not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence -- continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling,";
N._Phl2_13="for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose.";
N._Phl2_14="Do everything without complaining or arguing,";
N._Phl2_15="so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation, in which you shine like stars in the universe";
N._Phl2_16="as you hold out the word of life -- in order that I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor for nothing.";
N._Phl2_17="But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.";
N._Phl2_18="So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.";
N._Phl2_19="I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you.";
N._Phl2_20="I have no one else like him, who takes a genuine interest in your welfare.";
N._Phl2_21="For everyone looks out for his own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.";
N._Phl2_22="But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel.";
N._Phl2_23="I hope, therefore, to send him as soon as I see how things go with me.";
N._Phl2_24="And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon.";
N._Phl2_25="But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs.";
N._Phl2_26="For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill.";
N._Phl2_27="Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.";
N._Phl2_28="Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety.";
N._Phl2_29="Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor men like him,";
N._Phl2_30="because he almost died for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for the help you could not give me.";
N._Phl3_1="Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.";
N._Phl3_2="Watch out for those dogs, those men who do evil, those mutilators of the flesh.";
N._Phl3_3="For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh--";
N._Phl3_4="though I myself have reasons for such confidence.";
N._Phl3_5="If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee;";
N._Phl3_6="as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for legalistic righteousness, faultless.";
N._Phl3_7="But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.";
N._Phl3_8="What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ";
N._Phl3_9="and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ -- the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith.";
N._Phl3_10="I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,";
N._Phl3_11="and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.";
N._Phl3_12="Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.";
N._Phl3_13="Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,";
N._Phl3_14="I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.";
N._Phl3_15="All of us who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you.";
N._Phl3_16="Only let us live up to what we have already attained.";
N._Phl3_17="Join with others in following my example, brothers, and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you.";
N._Phl3_18="For, as I have often told you before and now say again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.";
N._Phl3_19="Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is on earthly things.";
N._Phl3_20="But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,";
N._Phl3_21="who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.";
N._Phl4_1="Therefore, my brothers, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, that is how you should stand firm in the Lord, dear friends!";
N._Phl4_2="I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to agree with each other in the Lord.";
N._Phl4_3="Yes, and I ask you, loyal yokefellow, help these women who have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.";
N._Phl4_4="Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!";
N._Phl4_5="Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near.";
N._Phl4_6="Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.";
N._Phl4_7="And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.";
N._Phl4_8="Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable -- if anything is excellent or praiseworthy -- think about such things.";
N._Phl4_9="Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me -- put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.";
N._Phl4_10="I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last you have renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you have been concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it.";
N._Phl4_11="I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.";
N._Phl4_12="I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.";
N._Phl4_13="I can do everything through him who gives me strength.";
N._Phl4_14="Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles.";
N._Phl4_15="Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only;";
N._Phl4_16="for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid again and again when I was in need.";
N._Phl4_17="Not that I am looking for a gift, but I am looking for what may be credited to your account.";
N._Phl4_18="I have received full payment and even more; I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.";
N._Phl4_19="And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.";
N._Phl4_20="To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.";
N._Phl4_21="Greet all the saints in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send greetings.";
N._Phl4_22="All the saints send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar's household.";
N._Phl4_23="The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.";
N._Col1_1="Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,";
N._Col1_2="To the holy and faithful brothers in Christ at Colosse: Grace and peace to you from God our Father.";
N._Col1_3="We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,";
N._Col1_4="because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints--";
N._Col1_5="the faith and love that spring from the hope that is stored up for you in heaven and that you have already heard about in the word of truth, the gospel";
N._Col1_6="that has come to you. All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood God's grace in all its truth.";
N._Col1_7="You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,";
N._Col1_8="and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.";
N._Col1_9="For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding.";
N._Col1_10="And we pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,";
N._Col1_11="being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and joyfully";
N._Col1_12="giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light.";
N._Col1_13="For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves,";
N._Col1_14="in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.";
N._Col1_15="He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.";
N._Col1_16="For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him.";
N._Col1_17="He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.";
N._Col1_18="And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.";
N._Col1_19="For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him,";
N._Col1_20="and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.";
N._Col1_21="Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior.";
N._Col1_22="But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation--";
N._Col1_23="if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.";
N._Col1_24="Now I rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church.";
N._Col1_25="I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness--";
N._Col1_26="the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the saints.";
N._Col1_27="To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.";
N._Col1_28="We proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ.";
N._Col1_29="To this end I labor, struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me.";
N._Col2_1="I want you to know how much I am struggling for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not met me personally.";
N._Col2_2="My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ,";
N._Col2_3="in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.";
N._Col2_4="I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments.";
N._Col2_5="For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how orderly you are and how firm your faith in Christ is.";
N._Col2_6="So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in him,";
N._Col2_7="rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.";
N._Col2_8="See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ.";
N._Col2_9="For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form,";
N._Col2_10="and you have been given fullness in Christ, who is the head over every power and authority.";
N._Col2_11="In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by the hands of men but with the circumcision done by Christ,";
N._Col2_12="having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.";
N._Col2_13="When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins,";
N._Col2_14="having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross.";
N._Col2_15="And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.";
N._Col2_16="Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.";
N._Col2_17="These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.";
N._Col2_18="Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize. Such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen, and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions.";
N._Col2_19="He has lost connection with the Head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow.";
N._Col2_20="Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules:";
N._Col2_21="\"Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!\"?";
N._Col2_22="These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings.";
N._Col2_23="Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their selfimposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.";
N._Col3_1="Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.";
N._Col3_2="Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.";
