N._Mat26_64="\"Yes, it is as you say,\" Jesus replied. \"But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\"";
N._Mat26_65="Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, \"He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.";
N._Mat26_66="What do you think?\" \"He is worthy of death,\" they answered.";
N._Mat26_67="Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him";
N._Mat26_68="and said, \"Prophesy to us, Christ. Who hit you?\"";
N._Mat26_69="Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. \"You also were with Jesus of Galilee,\" she said.";
N._Mat26_70="But he denied it before them all. \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he said.";
N._Mat26_71="Then he went out to the gateway, where another girl saw him and said to the people there, \"This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.\"";
N._Mat26_72="He denied it again, with an oath: \"I don't know the man!\"";
N._Mat26_73="After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, \"Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away.\"";
N._Mat26_74="Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, \"I don't know the man!\"";
N._Mat26_75="Immediately a rooster crowed. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: \"Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.\" And he went outside and wept bitterly.";
N._Mat27_1="Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death.";
N._Mat27_2="They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.";
N._Mat27_3="When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders.";
N._Mat27_4="\"I have sinned,\" he said, \"for I have betrayed innocent blood.\" \"What is that to us?\" they replied. \"That's your responsibility.\"";
N._Mat27_5="So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.";
N._Mat27_6="The chief priests picked up the coins and said, \"It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.\"";
N._Mat27_7="So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners.";
N._Mat27_8="That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.";
N._Mat27_9="Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: \"They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel,";
N._Mat27_10="and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me.\"";
N._Mat27_11="Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" \"Yes, it is as you say,\" Jesus replied.";
N._Mat27_12="When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer.";
N._Mat27_13="Then Pilate asked him, \"Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?\"";
N._Mat27_14="But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge -- to the great amazement of the governor.";
N._Mat27_15="Now it was the governor's custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd.";
N._Mat27_16="At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.";
N._Mat27_17="So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, \"Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?\"";
N._Mat27_18="For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.";
N._Mat27_19="While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: \"Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.\"";
N._Mat27_20="But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.";
N._Mat27_21="\"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?\" asked the governor. \"Barabbas,\" they answered.";
N._Mat27_22="\"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?\" Pilate asked. They all answered, \"Crucify him!\"";
N._Mat27_23="\"Why? What crime has he committed?\" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, \"Crucify him!\"";
N._Mat27_24="When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. \"I am innocent of this man's blood,\" he said. \"It is your responsibility!\"";
N._Mat27_25="All the people answered, \"Let his blood be on us and on our children!\"";
N._Mat27_26="Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.";
N._Mat27_27="Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.";
N._Mat27_28="They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,";
N._Mat27_29="and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. \"Hail, king of the Jews!\" they said.";
N._Mat27_30="They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.";
N._Mat27_31="After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.";
N._Mat27_32="As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.";
N._Mat27_33="They came to a place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).";
N._Mat27_34="There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.";
N._Mat27_35="When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.";
N._Mat27_36="And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.";
N._Mat27_37="Above his head they placed the written charge against him:";
N._Mat27_38="Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.";
N._Mat27_39="Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads";
N._Mat27_40="and saying, \"You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!\"";
N._Mat27_41="In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.";
N._Mat27_42="\"He saved others,\" they said, \"but he can't save himself! He's the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.";
N._Mat27_43="He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.' \"";
N._Mat27_44="In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.";
N._Mat27_45="From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.";
N._Mat27_46="About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\"--which means, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\"";
N._Mat27_47="When some of those standing there heard this, they said, \"He's calling Elijah.\"";
N._Mat27_48="Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.";
N._Mat27_49="The rest said, \"Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him.\"";
N._Mat27_50="And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.";
N._Mat27_51="At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split.";
N._Mat27_52="The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.";
N._Mat27_53="They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus' resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.";
N._Mat27_54="When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, \"Surely he was the Son of God!\"";
N._Mat27_55="Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.";
N._Mat27_56="Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.";
N._Mat27_57="As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.";
N._Mat27_58="Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.";
N._Mat27_59="Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,";
N._Mat27_60="and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.";
N._Mat27_61="Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.";
N._Mat27_62="The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.";
N._Mat27_63="\"Sir,\" they said, \"we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.'";
N._Mat27_64="So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.\"";
N._Mat27_65="\"Take a guard,\" Pilate answered. \"Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.\"";
N._Mat27_66="So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.";
N._Mat28_1="After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.";
N._Mat28_2="There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.";
N._Mat28_3="His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.";
N._Mat28_4="The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.";
N._Mat28_5="The angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.";
N._Mat28_6="He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.";
N._Mat28_7="Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.\"";
N._Mat28_8="So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.";
N._Mat28_9="Suddenly Jesus met them. \"Greetings,\" he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.";
N._Mat28_10="Then Jesus said to them, \"Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.\"";
N._Mat28_11="While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.";
N._Mat28_12="When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,";
N._Mat28_13="telling them, \"You are to say, 'His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.'";
N._Mat28_14="If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.\"";
N._Mat28_15="So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.";
N._Mat28_16="Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.";
N._Mat28_17="When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.";
N._Mat28_18="Then Jesus came to them and said, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.";
N._Mat28_19="Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,";
N._Mat28_20="and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.\"";
N._Mak1_1="The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.";
N._Mak1_2="It is written in Isaiah the prophet: \"I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way\" --";
N._Mak1_3="\"a voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.' \"";
N._Mak1_4="And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.";
N._Mak1_5="The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.";
N._Mak1_6="John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.";
N._Mak1_7="And this was his message: \"After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.";
N._Mak1_8="I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\"";
N._Mak1_9="At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.";
N._Mak1_10="As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.";
N._Mak1_11="And a voice came from heaven: \"You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.\"";
N._Mak1_12="At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert,";
N._Mak1_13="and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.";
N._Mak1_14="After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.";
N._Mak1_15="\"The time has come,\" he said. \"The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!\"";
N._Mak1_16="As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.";
N._Mak1_17="\"Come, follow me,\" Jesus said, \"and I will make you fishers of men.\"";
N._Mak1_18="At once they left their nets and followed him.";
N._Mak1_19="When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.";
N._Mak1_20="Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.";
N._Mak1_21="They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.";
N._Mak1_22="The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.";
N._Mak1_23="Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out,";
N._Mak1_24="\"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are -- the Holy One of God!\"";
N._Mak1_25="\"Be quiet!\" said Jesus sternly. \"Come out of him!\"";
N._Mak1_26="The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.";
N._Mak1_27="The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, \"What is this? A new teaching -- and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him.\"";
N._Mak1_28="News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.";
N._Mak1_29="As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.";
N._Mak1_30="Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.";
N._Mak1_31="So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.";
N._Mak1_32="That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demonpossessed.";
N._Mak1_33="The whole town gathered at the door,";
N._Mak1_34="and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.";
N._Mak1_35="Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.";
N._Mak1_36="Simon and his companions went to look for him,";
N._Mak1_37="and when they found him, they exclaimed: \"Everyone is looking for you!\"";
N._Mak1_38="Jesus replied, \"Let us go somewhere else -- to the nearby villages -- so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.\"";
N._Mak1_39="So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.";
N._Mak1_40="A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, \"If you are willing, you can make me clean.\"";
N._Mak1_41="Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. \"I am willing,\" he said. \"Be clean!\"";
N._Mak1_42="Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured.";
N._Mak1_43="Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:";
N._Mak1_44="\"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.\"";
N._Mak1_45="Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.";
N._Mak2_1="A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.";
N._Mak2_2="So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.";
N._Mak2_3="Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.";
N._Mak2_4="Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on.";
N._Mak2_5="When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, \"Son, your sins are forgiven.\"";
N._Mak2_6="Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,";
N._Mak2_7="\"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?\"";
N._Mak2_8="Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, \"Why are you thinking these things?";
N._Mak2_9="Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'?";
N._Mak2_10="But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . . . .\" He said to the paralytic,";
N._Mak2_11="\"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.\"";
N._Mak2_12="He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, \"We have never seen anything like this!\"";
N._Mak2_13="Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.";
N._Mak2_14="As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. \"Follow me,\" Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.";
N._Mak2_15="While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and \"sinners\" were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.";
N._Mak2_16="When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the \"sinners\" and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: \"Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?\"";
N._Mak2_17="On hearing this, Jesus said to them, \"It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\"";
N._Mak2_18="Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, \"How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?\"";
N._Mak2_19="Jesus answered, \"How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.";
N._Mak2_20="But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.";
N._Mak2_21="\"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.";
N._Mak2_22="And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, he pours new wine into new wineskins.\"";
N._Mak2_23="One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.";
N._Mak2_24="The Pharisees said to him, \"Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?\"";
N._Mak2_25="He answered, \"Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?";
N._Mak2_26="In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.\"";
N._Mak2_27="Then he said to them, \"The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.";
N._Mak2_28="So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.\"";
N._Mak3_1="Another time he went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there.";
N._Mak3_2="Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.";
N._Mak3_3="Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, \"Stand up in front of everyone.\"";
N._Mak3_4="Then Jesus asked them, \"Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?\" But they remained silent.";
N._Mak3_5="He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.";
N._Mak3_6="Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.";
N._Mak3_7="Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed.";
N._Mak3_8="When they heard all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.";
N._Mak3_9="Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him.";
N._Mak3_10="For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.";
N._Mak3_11="Whenever the evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, \"You are the Son of God.\"";
N._Mak3_12="But he gave them strict orders not to tell who he was.";
N._Mak3_13="Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.";
N._Mak3_14="He appointed twelve -- designating them apostles --that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach";
N._Mak3_15="and to have authority to drive out demons.";
N._Mak3_16="These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);";
N._Mak3_17="James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder);";
N._Mak3_18="Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot";
N._Mak3_19="and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.";
N._Mak3_20="Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat.";
N._Mak3_21="When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, \"He is out of his mind.\"";
N._Mak3_22="And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, \"He is possessed by Beelzebub ! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.\"";
N._Mak3_23="So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: \"How can Satan drive out Satan?";
N._Mak3_24="If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.";
N._Mak3_25="If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.";
N._Mak3_26="And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.";
N._Mak3_27="In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can rob his house.";
N._Mak3_28="I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them.";
N._Mak3_29="But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin.\"";
N._Mak3_30="He said this because they were saying, \"He has an evil spirit.\"";
N._Mak3_31="Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.";
N._Mak3_32="A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, \"Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.\"";
N._Mak3_33="\"Who are my mother and my brothers?\" he asked.";
N._Mak3_34="Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, \"Here are my mother and my brothers!";
N._Mak3_35="Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother.\"";
N._Mak4_1="Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water's edge.";
N._Mak4_2="He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said:";
N._Mak4_3="\"Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.";
N._Mak4_4="As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.";
N._Mak4_5="Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.";
N._Mak4_6="But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.";
N._Mak4_7="Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain.";
N._Mak4_8="Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times.\"";
N._Mak4_9="Then Jesus said, \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\"";
N._Mak4_10="When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables.";
N._Mak4_11="He told them, \"The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables";
N._Mak4_12="so that, \" 'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!' \"";
N._Mak4_13="Then Jesus said to them, \"Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?";
N._Mak4_14="The farmer sows the word.";
N._Mak4_15="Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.";
N._Mak4_16="Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy.";
N._Mak4_17="But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.";
N._Mak4_18="Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;";
N._Mak4_19="but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.";
N._Mak4_20="Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop -- thirty, sixty or even a hundred times what was sown.\"";
N._Mak4_21="He said to them, \"Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand?";
N._Mak4_22="For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.";
N._Mak4_23="If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.\"";
N._Mak4_24="\"Consider carefully what you hear,\" he continued. \"With the measure you use, it will be measured to you -- and even more.";
N._Mak4_25="Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.\"";
N._Mak4_26="He also said, \"This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.";
N._Mak4_27="Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.";
N._Mak4_28="All by itself the soil produces grain-- first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.";
N._Mak4_29="As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.\"";
N._Mak4_30="Again he said, \"What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?";
N._Mak4_31="It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground.";
N._Mak4_32="Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade.\"";
N._Mak4_33="With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.";

N._Mak5_3="This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain.";
N._Mak5_4="For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.";
N._Mak5_5="Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.";
