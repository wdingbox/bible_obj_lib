N._Jug14_20="And Samson's wife was given to the friend who had attended him at his wedding.";

N._Jug15_6="When the Philistines asked, \"Who did this?\" they were told, \"Samson, the Timnite's son-in-law, because his wife was given to his friend.\" So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death.";

N._Jug15_9="The Philistines went up and camped in Judah, spreading out near Lehi.";
N._Jug15_10="The men of Judah asked, \"Why have you come to fight us?\" \"We have come to take Samson prisoner,\" they answered, \"to do to him as he did to us.\"";

N._Jug15_15="Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men.";
N._Jug15_16="Then Samson said, \"With a donkey's jawbone I have made donkeys of them. With a donkey's jawbone I have killed a thousand men.\"";
N._Jug15_17="When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone; and the place was called Ramath Lehi.";
N._Jug15_18="Because he was very thirsty, he cried out to the LORD , \"You have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?\"";
N._Jug15_19="Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned and he revived. So the spring was called En Hakkore, and it is still there in Lehi.";
N._Jug15_20="Samson led Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines.";
N._Jug16_1="One day Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a prostitute. He went in to spend the night with her.";

N._Jug16_3="But Samson lay there only until the middle of the night. Then he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate, together with the two posts, and tore them loose, bar and all. He lifted them to his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron.";
N._Jug16_4="Some time later, he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah.";
N._Jug16_5="The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, \"See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver.\"";

N._Jug16_7="Samson answered her, \"If anyone ties me with seven fresh thongs that have not been dried, I'll become as weak as any other man.\"";
N._Jug16_8="Then the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh thongs that had not been dried, and she tied him with them.";
N._Jug16_9="With men hidden in the room, she called to him, \"Samson, the Philistines are upon you!\" But he snapped the thongs as easily as a piece of string snaps when it comes close to a flame. So the secret of his strength was not discovered.";
N._Jug16_10="Then Delilah said to Samson, \"You have made a fool of me; you lied to me. Come now, tell me how you can be tied.\"";
N._Jug16_11="He said, \"If anyone ties me securely with new ropes that have never been used, I'll become as weak as any other man.\"";
N._Jug16_12="So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them. Then, with men hidden in the room, she called to him, \"Samson, the Philistines are upon you!\" But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were threads.";
N._Jug16_13="Delilah then said to Samson, \"Until now, you have been making a fool of me and lying to me. Tell me how you can be tied.\" He replied, \"If you weave the seven braids of my head into the fabric on the loom and tighten it with the pin, I'll become as weak as any other man.\" So while he was sleeping, Delilah took the seven braids of his head, wove them into the fabric";
N._Jug16_14="and tightened it with the pin. Again she called to him, \"Samson, the Philistines are upon you!\" He awoke from his sleep and pulled up the pin and the loom, with the fabric.";
N._Jug16_15="Then she said to him, \"How can you say, 'I love you,' when you won't confide in me? This is the third time you have made a fool of me and haven't told me the secret of your great strength.\"";
N._Jug16_16="With such nagging she prodded him day after day until he was tired to death.";
N._Jug16_17="So he told her everything. \"No razor has ever been used on my head,\" he said, \"because I have been a Nazirite set apart to God since birth. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as any other man.\"";
N._Jug16_18="When Delilah saw that he had told her everything, she sent word to the rulers of the Philistines, \"Come back once more; he has told me everything.\" So the rulers of the Philistines returned with the silver in their hands.";
N._Jug16_19="Having put him to sleep on her lap, she called a man to shave off the seven braids of his hair, and so began to subdue him. And his strength left him.";
N._Jug16_20="Then she called, \"Samson, the Philistines are upon you!\" He awoke from his sleep and thought, \"I'll go out as before and shake myself free.\" But he did not know that the LORD had left him.";
N._Jug16_21="Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding in the prison.";
N._Jug16_22="But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.";
N._Jug16_23="Now the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, \"Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands.\"";

N._Jug16_25="While they were in high spirits, they shouted, \"Bring out Samson to entertain us.\" So they called Samson out of the prison, and he performed for them. When they stood him among the pillars,";
N._Jug16_26="Samson said to the servant who held his hand, \"Put me where I can feel the pillars that support the temple, so that I may lean against them.\"";
N._Jug16_27="Now the temple was crowded with men and women; all the rulers of the Philistines were there, and on the roof were about three thousand men and women watching Samson perform.";
N._Jug16_28="Then Samson prayed to the LORD , \"O Sovereign LORD , remember me. O God, please strengthen me just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes.\"";
N._Jug16_29="Then Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood. Bracing himself against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other,";
N._Jug16_30="Samson said, \"Let me die with the Philistines!\" Then he pushed with all his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived.";
N._Jug16_31="Then his brothers and his father's whole family went down to get him. They brought him back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had led Israel twenty years.";
N._Jug17_1="Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim";

N._Jug17_5="Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some idols and installed one of his sons as his priest.";

N._Jug17_7="A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah,";

N._Jug18_3="When they were near Micah's house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they turned in there and asked him, \"Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?\"";

N._Jug18_8="When they returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers asked them, \"How did you find things?\"";

N._Jug18_11="Then six hundred men from the clan of the Danites, armed for battle, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.";
N._Jug18_12="On their way they set up camp near Kiriath Jearim in Judah. This is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is called Mahaneh Dan to this day.";
N._Jug18_13="From there they went on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah's house.";

N._Jug18_19="They answered him, \"Be quiet! Don't say a word. Come with us, and be our father and priest. Isn't it better that you serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest rather than just one man's household?\"";
N._Jug18_20="Then the priest was glad. He took the ephod, the other household gods and the carved image and went along with the people.";
N._Jug18_21="Putting their little children, their livestock and their possessions in front of them, they turned away and left.";
N._Jug18_22="When they had gone some distance from Micah's house, the men who lived near Micah were called together and overtook the Danites.";

N._Jug18_24="He replied, \"You took the gods I made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have? How can you ask, 'What's the matter with you?' \"";
N._Jug18_25="The Danites answered, \"Don't argue with us, or some hot-tempered men will attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives.\"";
N._Jug18_26="So the Danites went their way, and Micah, seeing that they were too strong for him, turned around and went back home.";
N._Jug18_27="Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and went on to Laish, against a peaceful and unsuspecting people. They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city.";
N._Jug18_28="There was no one to rescue them because they lived a long way from Sidon and had no relationship with anyone else. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there.";
N._Jug18_29="They named it Dan after their forefather Dan, who was born to Israel though the city used to be called Laish.";
N._Jug18_30="There the Danites set up for themselves the idols, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the captivity of the land.";
N._Jug18_31="They continued to use the idols Micah had made, all the time the house of God was in Shiloh.";
