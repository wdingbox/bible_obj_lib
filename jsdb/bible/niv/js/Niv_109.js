N._Mat14_28="\"Lord, if it's you,\" Peter replied, \"tell me to come to you on the water.\"";
N._Mat14_29="\"Come,\" he said.";
N._Mat14_30="Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, \"Lord, save me!\"";
N._Mat14_31="Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. \"You of little faith,\" he said, \"why did you doubt?\"";
N._Mat14_32="And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.";
N._Mat14_33="Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, \"Truly you are the Son of God.\"";
N._Mat14_34="When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.";
N._Mat14_35="And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him";
N._Mat14_36="and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.";
N._Mat15_1="Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,";
N._Mat15_2="\"Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands before they eat!\"";
N._Mat15_3="Jesus replied, \"And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?";
N._Mat15_4="For God said, 'Honor your father and mother' and 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'";
N._Mat15_5="But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is a gift devoted to God,'";
N._Mat15_6="he is not to 'honor his father ' with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.";
N._Mat15_7="You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:";
N._Mat15_8="\" 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.";
N._Mat15_9="They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.' \"";
N._Mat15_10="Jesus called the crowd to him and said, \"Listen and understand.";
