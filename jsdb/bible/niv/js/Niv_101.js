N._Dan3_12="But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon-Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego - who pay no attention to you, O king. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up.\"";
N._Dan3_13="Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king,";
N._Dan3_14="and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, \"Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up?";
N._Dan3_15="Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?\"";
N._Dan3_16="Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to the king, \"O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter.";
N._Dan3_17="If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king.";
N._Dan3_18="But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.\"";
N._Dan3_19="Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual";
N._Dan3_20="and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace.";
N._Dan3_21="So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace.";
N._Dan3_22="The king's command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego,";
N._Dan3_23="and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace.";
N._Dan3_24="Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, \"Weren't there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?\" They replied, \"Certainly, O king.\"";
N._Dan3_25="He said, \"Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.\"";
N._Dan3_26="Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, \"Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!\" So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire,";
N._Dan3_27="and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them.";
N._Dan3_28="Then Nebuchadnezzar said, \"Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king's command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.";
N._Dan3_29="Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way.\"";
N._Dan3_30="Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.";

N._Dan4_2="It is my pleasure to tell you about the miraculous signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me.";
N._Dan4_3="How great are his signs, how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom; his dominion endures from generation to generation.";
N._Dan4_4="I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at home in my palace, contented and prosperous.";
N._Dan4_5="I had a dream that made me afraid. As I was lying in my bed, the images and visions that passed through my mind terrified me.";
N._Dan4_6="So I commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me to interpret the dream for me.";
N._Dan4_7="When the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners came, I told them the dream, but they could not interpret it for me.";
N._Dan4_8="Finally, Daniel came into my presence and I told him the dream. (He is called Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods is in him.)";
N._Dan4_9="I said, \"Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no mystery is too difficult for you. Here is my dream; interpret it for me.";
N._Dan4_10="These are the visions I saw while lying in my bed: I looked, and there before me stood a tree in the middle of the land. Its height was enormous.";
N._Dan4_11="The tree grew large and strong and its top touched the sky; it was visible to the ends of the earth.";
N._Dan4_12="Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit abundant, and on it was food for all. Under it the beasts of the field found shelter, and the birds of the air lived in its branches; from it every creature was fed.";
N._Dan4_13="\"In the visions I saw while lying in my bed, I looked, and there before me was a messenger, a holy one, coming down from heaven.";
N._Dan4_14="He called in a loud voice: 'Cut down the tree and trim off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches.";
N._Dan4_15="But let the stump and its roots, bound with iron and bronze, remain in the ground, in the grass of the field. \" 'Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth.";
N._Dan4_16="Let his mind be changed from that of a man and let him be given the mind of an animal, till seven times pass by for him.";
N._Dan4_17="\" 'The decision is announced by messengers, the holy ones declare the verdict, so that the living may know that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes and sets over them the lowliest of men.'";
N._Dan4_18="\"This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me what it means, for none of the wise men in my kingdom can interpret it for me. But you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.\"";
N._Dan4_19="Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar) was greatly perplexed for a time, and his thoughts terrified him. So the king said, \"Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its meaning alarm you.\" Belteshazzar answered, \"My lord, if only the dream applied to your enemies and its meaning to your adversaries!";
N._Dan4_20="The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, with its top touching the sky, visible to the whole earth,";
N._Dan4_21="with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit, providing food for all, giving shelter to the beasts of the field, and having nesting places in its branches for the birds of the air-";
N._Dan4_22="you, O king, are that tree! You have become great and strong; your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to distant parts of the earth.";
N._Dan4_23="\"You, O king, saw a messenger, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, 'Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump, bound with iron and bronze, in the grass of the field, while its roots remain in the ground.

N._Dan4_24="\"This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my lord the king:";
N._Dan4_25="You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like cattle and be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes.";
N._Dan4_26="The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that Heaven rules.";
N._Dan4_27="Therefore, O king, be pleased to accept my advice: Renounce your sins by doing what is right, and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed. It may be that then your prosperity will continue.\"";
N._Dan4_28="All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.";
N._Dan4_29="Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,";
N._Dan4_30="he said, \"Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?\"";
N._Dan4_31="The words were still on his lips when a voice came from heaven, \"This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar: Your royal authority has been taken from you.";

N._Dan4_33="Immediately what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people and ate grass like cattle. His body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird.";
N._Dan4_34="At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever. His dominion is an eternal dominion; his kingdom endures from generation to generation.";
N._Dan4_35="All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him: \"What have you done?\"";
N._Dan4_36="At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before.";
N._Dan4_37="Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, because everything he does is right and all his ways are just. And those who walk in pride he is able to humble.";
N._Dan5_1="King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them.";
N._Dan5_2="While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them.";
N._Dan5_3="So they brought in the gold goblets that had been taken from the temple of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines drank from them.";
N._Dan5_4="As they drank the wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone.";
N._Dan5_5="Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote.";
N._Dan5_6="His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his knees knocked together and his legs gave way.";
N._Dan5_7="The king called out for the enchanters, astrologers and diviners to be brought and said to these wise men of Babylon, \"Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck, and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.\"";
N._Dan5_8="Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant.";
N._Dan5_9="So King Belshazzar became even more terrified and his face grew more pale. His nobles were baffled.";
N._Dan5_10="The queen, hearing the voices of the king and his nobles, came into the banquet hall. \"O king, live forever!\" she said. \"Don't be alarmed! Don't look so pale!";
N._Dan5_11="There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods.

N._Dan5_12="This man Daniel, whom the king called Belteshazzar, was found to have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding, and also the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means.\"";
N._Dan5_13="So Daniel was brought before the king, and the king said to him, \"Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah?";
N._Dan5_14="I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom.";
N._Dan5_15="The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me what it means, but they could not explain it.";
N._Dan5_16="Now I have heard that you are able to give interpretations and to solve difficult problems. If you can read this writing and tell me what it means, you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.\"";
N._Dan5_17="Then Daniel answered the king, \"You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means.";
N._Dan5_18="\"O king, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor.";
N._Dan5_19="Because of the high position he gave him, all the peoples and nations and men of every language dreaded and feared him. Those the king wanted to put to death, he put to death; those he wanted to spare, he spared; those he wanted to promote, he promoted; and those he wanted to humble, he humbled.";
N._Dan5_20="But when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory.";
N._Dan5_21="He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal; he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like cattle; and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and sets over them anyone he wishes.";
N._Dan5_22="\"But you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled yourself, though you knew all this.";
N._Dan5_23="Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from his temple brought to you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways.";
N._Dan5_24="Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription.";
N._Dan5_25="\"This is the inscription that was written: Mene , Mene , Tekel , Parsin";
N._Dan5_26="\"This is what these words mean: Mene : God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end.";
N._Dan5_27="Tekel : You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting.";
N._Dan5_28="Peres : Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.\"";
N._Dan5_29="Then at Belshazzar's command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom.";
N._Dan5_30="That very night Belshazzar, king of the Babylonians, was slain,";
N._Dan5_31="and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom, at the age of sixty-two.";
N._Dan6_1="It pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom,";
N._Dan6_2="with three administrators over them, one of whom was Daniel. The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss.";
N._Dan6_3="Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.";
N._Dan6_4="At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent.";
N._Dan6_5="Finally these men said, \"We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God.\"";
N._Dan6_6="So the administrators and the satraps went as a group to the king and said: \"O King Darius, live forever!";
N._Dan6_7="The royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or man during the next thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be thrown into the lions' den.";
N._Dan6_8="Now, O king, issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered - in accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.\"";
N._Dan6_9="So King Darius put the decree in writing.";
N._Dan6_10="Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before.";
N._Dan6_11="Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help.";
N._Dan6_12="So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: \"Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or man except to you, O king, would be thrown into the lions' den?\" The king answered, \"The decree stands - in accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.\"";
N._Dan6_13="Then they said to the king, \"Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the decree you put in writing. He still prays three times a day.\"";
N._Dan6_14="When the king heard this, he was greatly distressed; he was determined to rescue Daniel and made every effort until sundown to save him.";
N._Dan6_15="Then the men went as a group to the king and said to him, \"Remember, O king, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed.\"";
N._Dan6_16="So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions' den. The king said to Daniel, \"May your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!\"";
N._Dan6_17="A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel's situation might not be changed.";
N._Dan6_18="Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him. And he could not sleep.";
N._Dan6_19="At the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions' den.";
N._Dan6_20="When he came near the den, he called to Daniel in an anguished voice, \"Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?\"";
N._Dan6_21="Daniel answered, \"O king, live forever!";
N._Dan6_22="My God sent his angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, because I was found innocent in his sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you, O king.\"";
N._Dan6_23="The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den. And when Daniel was lifted from the den, no wound was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.";
N._Dan6_24="At the king's command, the men who had falsely accused Daniel were brought in and thrown into the lions' den, along with their wives and children. And before they reached the floor of the den, the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.";
N._Dan6_25="Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations and men of every language throughout the land: \"May you prosper greatly!";
N._Dan6_26="\"I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel. \"For he is the living God and he endures forever; his kingdom will not be destroyed, his dominion will never end.";

N._Dan6_28="So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.";
N._Dan7_1="In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying on his bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream.";
N._Dan7_2="Daniel said: \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea.";
N._Dan7_3="Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea.";
N._Dan7_4="\"The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a man, and the heart of a man was given to it.";
N._Dan7_5="\"And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up and eat your fill of flesh!'";
N._Dan7_6="\"After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule.";
N._Dan7_7="\"After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beastterrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns.";
N._Dan7_8="\"While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully.";
N._Dan7_9="\"As I looked, \"thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze.";
N._Dan7_10="A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened.";
N._Dan7_11="\"Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire.";
N._Dan7_12="(The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.)";
N._Dan7_13="\"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence.";
N._Dan7_14="He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.";
N._Dan7_15="\"I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me.";
N._Dan7_16="I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. \"So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things:";
N._Dan7_17="'The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth.";
N._Dan7_18="But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever-yes, for ever and ever.'";
N._Dan7_19="\"Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws - the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left.";
N._Dan7_20="I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell - the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully.";
N._Dan7_21="As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them,";
N._Dan7_22="until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom.";
N._Dan7_23="\"He gave me this explanation: 'The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it.";
N._Dan7_24="The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings.";
N._Dan7_25="He will speak against the Most High and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws. The saints will be handed over to him for a time, times and half a time.";

N._Dan7_28="\"This is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was deeply troubled by my thoughts, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself.\"";
N._Dan8_1="In the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, I, Daniel, had a vision, after the one that had already appeared to me.";
N._Dan8_2="In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal.";
N._Dan8_3="I looked up, and there before me was a ram with two horns, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later.";
N._Dan8_4="I watched the ram as he charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against him, and none could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great.";
N._Dan8_5="As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between his eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground.";
N._Dan8_6="He came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at him in great rage.";
N._Dan8_7="I saw him attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering his two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against him; the goat knocked him to the ground and trampled on him, and none could rescue the ram from his power.";
N._Dan8_8="The goat became very great, but at the height of his power his large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven.";
N._Dan8_9="Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land.";
N._Dan8_10="It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them.";
N._Dan8_11="It set itself up to be as great as the Prince of the host; it took away the daily sacrifice from him, and the place of his sanctuary was brought low.";
N._Dan8_12="Because of rebellion, the host of the saints and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground.";
N._Dan8_13="Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, \"How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled - the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, and the surrender of the sanctuary and of the host that will be trampled underfoot?\"";

N._Dan8_15="While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who looked like a man.";
N._Dan8_16="And I heard a man's voice from the Ulai calling, \"Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision.\"";
N._Dan8_17="As he came near the place where I was standing, I was terrified and fell prostrate. \"Son of man,\" he said to me, \"understand that the vision concerns the time of the end.\"";
N._Dan8_18="While he was speaking to me, I was in a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me and raised me to my feet.";

N._Dan8_25="He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.";
