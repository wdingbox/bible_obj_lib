N._1Sa16_5="Samuel replied, \"Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord . Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me.\" Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.";
N._1Sa16_6="When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, \"Surely the Lord 's anointed stands here before the Lord .\"";
N._1Sa16_7="But the Lord said to Samuel, \"Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.\"";
N._1Sa16_8="Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, \"The Lord has not chosen this one either.\"";
N._1Sa16_9="Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, \"Nor has the Lord chosen this one.\"";
N._1Sa16_10="Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, \"The Lord has not chosen these.\"";
N._1Sa16_11="So he asked Jesse, \"Are these all the sons you have?\" \"There is still the youngest,\" Jesse answered, \"but he is tending the sheep.\" Samuel said, \"Send for him; we will not sit down until he arrives.\"";
N._1Sa16_12="So he sent and had him brought in. He was ruddy, with a fine appearance and handsome features. Then the Lord said, \"Rise and anoint him; he is the one.\"";
N._1Sa16_13="So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the Lord came upon David in power. Samuel then went to Ramah.";

N._1Sa16_18="One of the servants answered, \"I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the harp. He is a brave man and a warrior. He speaks well and is a fine-looking man. And the Lord is with him.\"";

N._1Sa17_11="On hearing the Philistine's words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified.";

N._1Sa17_29="\"Now what have I done?\" said David. \"Can't I even speak?\"";

N._1Sa17_48="As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him.";
N._1Sa17_49="Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground.";

N._1Sa17_51="David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine's sword and drew it from the scabbard. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran.";

N._1Sa17_54="David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put the Philistine's weapons in his own tent.";
N._1Sa17_55="As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, \"Abner, whose son is that young man?\" Abner replied, \"As surely as you live, O king, I don't know.\"";

N._1Sa18_1="After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself.";
N._1Sa18_2="From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return to his father's house.";
N._1Sa18_3="And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.";
N._1Sa18_4="Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt.";
N._1Sa18_5="Whatever Saul sent him to do, David did it so successfully that Saul gave him a high rank in the army. This pleased all the people, and Saul's officers as well.";
N._1Sa18_6="When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with tambourines and lutes.";
N._1Sa18_7="As they danced, they sang: \"Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands.\"";

N._1Sa18_10="The next day an evil spirit from God came forcefully upon Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the harp, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand";
N._1Sa18_11="and he hurled it, saying to himself, \"I'll pin David to the wall.\" But David eluded him twice.";
N._1Sa18_12="Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with David but had left Saul.";
N._1Sa18_13="So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns.";
N._1Sa18_14="In everything he did he had great success, because the Lord was with him.";
N._1Sa18_15="When Saul saw how successful he was, he was afraid of him.";
N._1Sa18_16="But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns.";
N._1Sa18_17="Saul said to David, \"Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the Lord .\" For Saul said to himself, \"I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!\"";
N._1Sa18_18="But David said to Saul, \"Who am I, and what is my family or my father's clan in Israel, that I should become the king's son-in-law?\"";
N._1Sa18_19="So when the time came for Merab, Saul's daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah.";

N._1Sa18_21="\"I will give her to him,\" he thought, \"so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.\" So Saul said to David, \"Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law.\"";
N._1Sa18_22="Then Saul ordered his attendants: \"Speak to David privately and say, 'Look, the king is pleased with you, and his attendants all like you; now become his son-in-law.' \"";

N._1Sa18_25="Saul replied, \"Say to David, 'The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.' \" Saul's plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.";

N._1Sa18_27="David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented the full number to the king so that he might become the king's son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.";
N._1Sa18_28="When Saul realized that the Lord was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David,";
N._1Sa18_29="Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days.";
N._1Sa18_30="The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success than the rest of Saul's officers, and his name became well known.";
N._1Sa19_1="Saul told his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David. But Jonathan was very fond of David";

N._1Sa19_6="Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath: \"As surely as the Lord lives, David will not be put to death.\"";
N._1Sa19_7="So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before.";
N._1Sa19_8="Once more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him.";
N._1Sa19_9="But an evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. While David was playing the harp,";
N._1Sa19_10="Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape.";
N._1Sa19_11="Saul sent men to David's house to watch it and to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, warned him, \"If you don't run for your life tonight, tomorrow you'll be killed.\"";
N._1Sa19_12="So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped.";
N._1Sa19_13="Then Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats' hair at the head.";
N._1Sa19_14="When Saul sent the men to capture David, Michal said, \"He is ill.\"";

N._1Sa19_17="Saul said to Michal, \"Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?\" Michal told him, \"He said to me, 'Let me get away. Why should I kill you?' \"";
N._1Sa19_18="When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.";
N._1Sa19_19="Word came to Saul: \"David is in Naioth at Ramah\";";
N._1Sa19_20="so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came upon Saul's men and they also prophesied.";
N._1Sa19_21="Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied.";

N._1Sa19_24="He stripped off his robes and also prophesied in Samuel's presence. He lay that way all that day and night. This is why people say, \"Is Saul also among the prophets?\"";

N._1Sa20_15="and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family - not even when the Lord has cut off every one of David's enemies from the face of the earth.\"";
N._1Sa20_16="So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, \"May the Lord call David's enemies to account.\"";
N._1Sa20_17="And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.";

N._1Sa21_11="But the servants of Achish said to him, \"Isn't this David, the king of the land? Isn't he the one they sing about in their dances: \" 'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands'?\"";
N._1Sa21_12="David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath.";
N._1Sa21_13="So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.";
N._1Sa21_14="Achish said to his servants, \"Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me?";
N._1Sa21_15="Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?\"";
N._1Sa22_1="David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father's household heard about it, they went down to him there.";
N._1Sa22_2="All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.";
N._1Sa22_3="From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, \"Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God will do for me?\"";
N._1Sa22_4="So he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold.";
N._1Sa22_5="But the prophet Gad said to David, \"Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah.\" So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.";
N._1Sa22_6="Now Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. And Saul, spear in hand, was seated under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with all his officials standing around him.";
N._1Sa22_7="Saul said to them, \"Listen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?";
