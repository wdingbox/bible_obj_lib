N._2Sa14_16="Perhaps the king will agree to deliver his servant from the hand of the man who is trying to cut off both me and my son from the inheritance God gave us.'";
N._2Sa14_17="\"And now your servant says, 'May the word of my lord the king bring me rest, for my lord the king is like an angel of God in discerning good and evil. May the Lord your God be with you.' \"";

N._2Sa14_19="The king asked, \"Isn't the hand of Joab with you in all this?\" The woman answered, \"As surely as you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything my lord the king says.

N._2Sa14_28="Absalom lived two years in Jerusalem without seeing the king's face.";
N._2Sa14_29="Then Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come to him. So he sent a second time, but he refused to come.";
N._2Sa14_30="Then he said to his servants, \"Look, Joab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire.\" So Absalom's servants set the field on fire.";

N._2Sa14_33="So Joab went to the king and told him this. Then the king summoned Absalom, and he came in and bowed down with his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.";
N._2Sa15_1="In the course of time, Absalom provided himself with a chariot and horses and with fifty men to run ahead of him.";
N._2Sa15_2="He would get up early and stand by the side of the road leading to the city gate.

N._2Sa15_23="The whole countryside wept aloud as all the people passed by. The king also crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people moved on toward the desert.";
N._2Sa15_24="Zadok was there, too, and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving the city.";
N._2Sa15_25="Then the king said to Zadok, \"Take the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the Lord 's eyes, he will bring me back and let me see it and his dwelling place again.";

N._2Sa15_31="Now David had been told, \"Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.\" So David prayed, \"O Lord , turn Ahithophel's counsel into foolishness.\"";
N._2Sa15_32="When David arrived at the summit, where people used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him, his robe torn and dust on his head.";

N._2Sa16_2="The king asked Ziba, \"Why have you brought these?\" Ziba answered, \"The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the desert.\"";

N._2Sa16_12="It may be that the Lord will see my distress and repay me with good for the cursing I am receiving today.\"";

N._2Sa16_14="The king and all the people with him arrived at their destination exhausted. And there he refreshed himself.";
N._2Sa16_15="Meanwhile, Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.";
N._2Sa16_16="Then Hushai the Arkite, David's friend, went to Absalom and said to him, \"Long live the king! Long live the king!\"";
N._2Sa16_17="Absalom asked Hushai, \"Is this the love you show your friend? Why didn't you go with your friend?\"";
N._2Sa16_18="Hushai said to Absalom, \"No, the one chosen by the Lord , by these people, and by all the men of Israel - his I will be, and I will remain with him.";
N._2Sa16_19="Furthermore, whom should I serve? Should I not serve the son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you.\"";
N._2Sa16_20="Absalom said to Ahithophel, \"Give us your advice. What should we do?\"";

N._2Sa17_14="Absalom and all the men of Israel said, \"The advice of Hushai the Arkite is better than that of Ahithophel.\" For the Lord had determined to frustrate the good advice of Ahithophel in order to bring disaster on Absalom.";
N._2Sa17_15="Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, \"Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel to do such and such, but I have advised them to do so and so.";

N._2Sa17_17="Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En Rogel. A servant girl was to go and inform them, and they were to go and tell King David, for they could not risk being seen entering the city.";
N._2Sa17_18="But a young man saw them and told Absalom. So the two of them left quickly and went to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it.";
N._2Sa17_19="His wife took a covering and spread it out over the opening of the well and scattered grain over it. No one knew anything about it.";
N._2Sa17_20="When Absalom's men came to the woman at the house, they asked, \"Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?\" The woman answered them, \"They crossed over the brook.\" The men searched but found no one, so they returned to Jerusalem.";
N._2Sa17_21="After the men had gone, the two climbed out of the well and went to inform King David. They said to him, \"Set out and cross the river at once; Ahithophel has advised such and such against you.\"";
N._2Sa17_22="So David and all the people with him set out and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, no one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.";
N._2Sa17_23="When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He put his house in order and then hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father's tomb.";
N._2Sa17_24="David went to Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.";
N._2Sa17_25="Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Jether, an Israelite who had married Abigail, the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah the mother of Joab.";

N._2Sa19_22="David replied, \"What do you and I have in common, you sons of Zeruiah? This day you have become my adversaries! Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Do I not know that today I am king over Israel?\"";
N._2Sa19_23="So the king said to Shimei, \"You shall not die.\" And the king promised him on oath.";
N._2Sa19_24="Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson, also went down to meet the king. He had not taken care of his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely.";
N._2Sa19_25="When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, \"Why didn't you go with me, Mephibosheth?\"";
N._2Sa19_26="He said, \"My lord the king, since I your servant am lame, I said, 'I will have my donkey saddled and will ride on it, so I can go with the king.' But Ziba my servant betrayed me.";
