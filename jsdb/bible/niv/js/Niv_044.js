N._1Ki17_6="The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook.";
N._1Ki17_7="Some time later the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land.";
N._1Ki17_8="Then the word of the Lord came to him:";
N._1Ki17_9="\"Go at once to Zarephath of Sidon and stay there. I have commanded a widow in that place to supply you with food.\"";
N._1Ki17_10="So he went to Zarephath. When he came to the town gate, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her and asked, \"Would you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink?\"";
N._1Ki17_11="As she was going to get it, he called, \"And bring me, please, a piece of bread.\"";
N._1Ki17_12="\"As surely as the Lord your God lives,\" she replied, \"I don't have any bread - only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it - and die.\"";
N._1Ki17_13="Elijah said to her, \"Don't be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small cake of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son.";
N._1Ki17_14="For this is what the Lord , the God of Israel, says: 'The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord gives rain on the land.' \"";
N._1Ki17_15="She went away and did as Elijah had told her. So there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family.";
N._1Ki17_16="For the jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the Lord spoken by Elijah.";
N._1Ki17_17="Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. He grew worse and worse, and finally stopped breathing.";
N._1Ki17_18="She said to Elijah, \"What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?\"";
