N._Mat26_46="Rise, let us go! Here comes my betrayer!\"";
N._Mat26_47="While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.";
N._Mat26_48="Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: \"The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.\"";
N._Mat26_49="Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, \"Greetings, Rabbi!\" and kissed him.";
N._Mat26_50="Jesus replied, \"Friend, do what you came for.\"";
N._Mat26_51="Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him. With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.";
N._Mat26_52="\"Put your sword back in its place,\" Jesus said to him, \"for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.";
N._Mat26_53="Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?";
N._Mat26_54="But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?\"";
N._Mat26_55="At that time Jesus said to the crowd, \"Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.";
N._Mat26_56="But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.\" Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.";
N._Mat26_57="Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.";
N._Mat26_58="But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.";
N._Mat26_59="The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.";
N._Mat26_60="But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward.";
N._Mat26_61="Finally two came forward and declared, \"This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.' \"";
N._Mat26_62="Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, \"Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?\"";
N._Mat26_63="But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, \"I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.\"";
