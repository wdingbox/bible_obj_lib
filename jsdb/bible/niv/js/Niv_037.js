N._1Sa22_8="Is that why you have all conspired against me? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me, as he does today.\"";
N._1Sa22_9="But Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul's officials, said, \"I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob.";
N._1Sa22_10="Ahimelech inquired of the Lord for him; he also gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.\"";
N._1Sa22_11="Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub and his father's whole family, who were the priests at Nob, and they all came to the king.";
N._1Sa22_12="Saul said, \"Listen now, son of Ahitub.\" \"Yes, my lord,\" he answered.";
N._1Sa22_13="Saul said to him, \"Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he does today?\"";
N._1Sa22_14="Ahimelech answered the king, \"Who of all your servants is as loyal as David, the king's son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household?";
N._1Sa22_15="Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his father's family, for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair.\"";
N._1Sa22_16="But the king said, \"You will surely die, Ahimelech, you and your father's whole family.\"";
N._1Sa22_17="Then the king ordered the guards at his side: \"Turn and kill the priests of the Lord , because they too have sided with David. They knew he was fleeing, yet they did not tell me.\" But the king's officials were not willing to raise a hand to strike the priests of the Lord .";
N._1Sa22_18="The king then ordered Doeg, \"You turn and strike down the priests.\" So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck them down. That day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.";
N._1Sa22_19="He also put to the sword Nob, the town of the priests, with its men and women, its children and infants, and its cattle, donkeys and sheep.";
N._1Sa22_20="But Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech son of Ahitub, escaped and fled to join David.";
N._1Sa22_21="He told David that Saul had killed the priests of the Lord .";
N._1Sa22_22="Then David said to Abiathar: \"That day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, I knew he would be sure to tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of your father's whole family.";
N._1Sa22_23="Stay with me; don't be afraid; the man who is seeking your life is seeking mine also. You will be safe with me.\"";
N._1Sa23_1="When David was told, \"Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are looting the threshing floors,\"";
N._1Sa23_2="he inquired of the Lord , saying, \"Shall I go and attack these Philistines?\" The Lord answered him, \"Go, attack the Philistines and save Keilah.\"";
N._1Sa23_3="But David's men said to him, \"Here in Judah we are afraid. How much more, then, if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!\"";
N._1Sa23_4="Once again David inquired of the Lord , and the Lord answered him, \"Go down to Keilah, for I am going to give the Philistines into your hand.\"";
N._1Sa23_5="So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines and carried off their livestock. He inflicted heavy losses on the Philistines and saved the people of Keilah.";
N._1Sa23_6="(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelech had brought the ephod down with him when he fled to David at Keilah.)";
N._1Sa23_7="Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, \"God has handed him over to me, for David has imprisoned himself by entering a town with gates and bars.\"";
N._1Sa23_8="And Saul called up all his forces for battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.";
N._1Sa23_9="When David learned that Saul was plotting against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, \"Bring the ephod.\"";
N._1Sa23_10="David said, \"O Lord , God of Israel, your servant has heard definitely that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account of me.";
N._1Sa23_11="Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me to him? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O Lord , God of Israel, tell your servant.\" And the Lord said, \"He will.\"";
N._1Sa23_12="Again David asked, \"Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul?\" And the Lord said, \"They will.\"";
N._1Sa23_13="So David and his men, about six hundred in number, left Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there.";
N._1Sa23_14="David stayed in the desert strongholds and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God did not give David into his hands.";
N._1Sa23_15="While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph, he learned that Saul had come out to take his life.";
N._1Sa23_16="And Saul's son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him find strength in God.";
N._1Sa23_17="\"Don't be afraid,\" he said. \"My father Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this.\"";
N._1Sa23_18="The two of them made a covenant before the Lord . Then Jonathan went home, but David remained at Horesh.";
N._1Sa23_19="The Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, \"Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon?";
N._1Sa23_20="Now, O king, come down whenever it pleases you to do so, and we will be responsible for handing him over to the king.\"";
N._1Sa23_21="Saul replied, \"The Lord bless you for your concern for me.";
N._1Sa23_22="Go and make further preparation. Find out where David usually goes and who has seen him there. They tell me he is very crafty.";
N._1Sa23_23="Find out about all the hiding places he uses and come back to me with definite information. Then I will go with you; if he is in the area, I will track him down among all the clans of Judah.\"";
N._1Sa23_24="So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon.";
N._1Sa23_25="Saul and his men began the search, and when David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon. When Saul heard this, he went into the Desert of Maon in pursuit of David.";
N._1Sa23_26="Saul was going along one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side, hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his forces were closing in on David and his men to capture them,";
N._1Sa23_27="a messenger came to Saul, saying, \"Come quickly! The Philistines are raiding the land.\"";
N._1Sa23_28="Then Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why they call this place Sela Hammahlekoth.";
N._1Sa23_29="And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.";
N._1Sa24_1="After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, \"David is in the Desert of En Gedi.\"";
N._1Sa24_2="So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats.";
N._1Sa24_3="He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave.";
N._1Sa24_4="The men said, \"This is the day the Lord spoke of when he said to you, 'I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.' \" Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul's robe.";
N._1Sa24_5="Afterward, David was consciencestricken for having cut off a corner of his robe.";
N._1Sa24_6="He said to his men, \"The Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the Lord 's anointed, or lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the Lord .\"";
N._1Sa24_7="With these words David rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way.";
N._1Sa24_8="Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, \"My lord the king!\" When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.";
N._1Sa24_9="He said to Saul, \"Why do you listen when men say, 'David is bent on harming you'?";
N._1Sa24_10="This day you have seen with your own eyes how the Lord delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, 'I will not lift my hand against my master, because he is the Lord 's anointed.'";
N._1Sa24_11="See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. Now understand and recognize that I am not guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life.";
N._1Sa24_12="May the Lord judge between you and me. And may the Lord avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you.";
N._1Sa24_13="As the old saying goes, 'From evildoers come evil deeds,' so my hand will not touch you.";
N._1Sa24_14="\"Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea?";
N._1Sa24_15="May the Lord be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand.\"";
N._1Sa24_16="When David finished saying this, Saul asked, \"Is that your voice, David my son?\" And he wept aloud.";
N._1Sa24_17="\"You are more righteous than I,\" he said. \"You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly.";
N._1Sa24_18="You have just now told me of the good you did to me; the Lord delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me.";
N._1Sa24_19="When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the Lord reward you well for the way you treated me today.";
N._1Sa24_20="I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands.";
N._1Sa24_21="Now swear to me by the Lord that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father's family.\"";
N._1Sa24_22="So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.";
N._1Sa25_1="Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David moved down into the Desert of Maon.";
N._1Sa25_2="A certain man in Maon, who had property there at Carmel, was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel.";
N._1Sa25_3="His name was Nabal and his wife's name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband, a Calebite, was surly and mean in his dealings.";
N._1Sa25_4="While David was in the desert, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep.";
N._1Sa25_5="So he sent ten young men and said to them, \"Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name.";
N._1Sa25_6="Say to him: 'Long life to you! Good health to you and your household! And good health to all that is yours!";
N._1Sa25_7="\" 'Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing time. When your shepherds were with us, we did not mistreat them, and the whole time they were at Carmel nothing of theirs was missing.";
N._1Sa25_8="Ask your own servants and they will tell you. Therefore be favorable toward my young men, since we come at a festive time. Please give your servants and your son David whatever you can find for them.' \"";
N._1Sa25_9="When David's men arrived, they gave Nabal this message in David's name. Then they waited.";
N._1Sa25_10="Nabal answered David's servants, \"Who is this David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days.";
N._1Sa25_11="Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows where?\"";
N._1Sa25_12="David's men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they reported every word.";
N._1Sa25_13="David said to his men, \"Put on your swords!\" So they put on their swords, and David put on his. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies.";
N._1Sa25_14="One of the servants told Nabal's wife Abigail: \"David sent messengers from the desert to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults at them.";
N._1Sa25_15="Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing.";
N._1Sa25_16="Night and day they were a wall around us all the time we were herding our sheep near them.";
N._1Sa25_17="Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him.\"";
N._1Sa25_18="Abigail lost no time. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys.";
N._1Sa25_19="Then she told her servants, \"Go on ahead; I'll follow you.\" But she did not tell her husband Nabal.";
N._1Sa25_20="As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them.";
N._1Sa25_21="David had just said, \"It's been uselessall my watching over this fellow's property in the desert so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good.";
N._1Sa25_22="May God deal with David, be it ever so severely, if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!\"";
N._1Sa25_23="When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground.";
N._1Sa25_24="She fell at his feet and said: \"My lord, let the blame be on me alone. Please let your servant speak to you; hear what your servant has to say.";
N._1Sa25_25="May my lord pay no attention to that wicked man Nabal. He is just like his name-his name is Fool, and folly goes with him. But as for me, your servant, I did not see the men my master sent.";
N._1Sa25_26="\"Now since the Lord has kept you, my master, from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands, as surely as the Lord lives and as you live, may your enemies and all who intend to harm my master be like Nabal.";
N._1Sa25_27="And let this gift, which your servant has brought to my master, be given to the men who follow you.";
N._1Sa25_28="Please forgive your servant's offense, for the Lord will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my master, because he fights the Lord 's battles. Let no wrongdoing be found in you as long as you live.";
N._1Sa25_29="Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my master will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the Lord your God. But the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling.";
N._1Sa25_30="When the Lord has done for my master every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him leader over Israel,";
N._1Sa25_31="my master will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself. And when the Lord has brought my master success, remember your servant.\"";
N._1Sa25_32="David said to Abigail, \"Praise be to the Lord , the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me.";
N._1Sa25_33="May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands.";
N._1Sa25_34="Otherwise, as surely as the Lord , the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak.\"";
N._1Sa25_35="Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, \"Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request.\"";
N._1Sa25_36="When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing until daybreak.";
N._1Sa25_37="Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone.";
N._1Sa25_38="About ten days later, the Lord struck Nabal and he died.";
N._1Sa25_39="When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, \"Praise be to the Lord , who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt.

N._1Sa25_40="His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, \"David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife.\"";
N._1Sa25_41="She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, \"Here is your maidservant, ready to serve you and wash the feet of my master's servants.\"";
N._1Sa25_42="Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five maids, went with David's messengers and became his wife.";
N._1Sa25_43="David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both were his wives.";
N._1Sa25_44="But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim.";
N._1Sa26_1="The Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said, \"Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah, which faces Jeshimon?\"";
N._1Sa26_2="So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph, with his three thousand chosen men of Israel, to search there for David.";
N._1Sa26_3="Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon, but David stayed in the desert. When he saw that Saul had followed him there,";
N._1Sa26_4="he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived.";
N._1Sa26_5="Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of the army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the camp, with the army encamped around him.";
N._1Sa26_6="David then asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, \"Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?\" \"I'll go with you,\" said Abishai.";
N._1Sa26_7="So David and Abishai went to the army by night, and there was Saul, lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him.";
N._1Sa26_8="Abishai said to David, \"Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of my spear; I won't strike him twice.\"";

N._1Sa26_10="As surely as the Lord lives,\" he said, \"the Lord himself will strike him; either his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish.";
N._1Sa26_11="But the Lord forbid that I should lay a hand on the Lord 's anointed. Now get the spear and water jug that are near his head, and let's go.\"";
N._1Sa26_12="So David took the spear and water jug near Saul's head, and they left. No one saw or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up. They were all sleeping, because the Lord had put them into a deep sleep.";
N._1Sa26_13="Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away; there was a wide space between them.";
N._1Sa26_14="He called out to the army and to Abner son of Ner, \"Aren't you going to answer me, Abner?\" Abner replied, \"Who are you who calls to the king?\"";
N._1Sa26_15="David said, \"You're a man, aren't you? And who is like you in Israel? Why didn't you guard your lord the king? Someone came to destroy your lord the king.";
N._1Sa26_16="What you have done is not good. As surely as the Lord lives, you and your men deserve to die, because you did not guard your master, the Lord 's anointed. Look around you. Where are the king's spear and water jug that were near his head?\"";
N._1Sa26_17="Saul recognized David's voice and said, \"Is that your voice, David my son?\" David replied, \"Yes it is, my lord the king.\"";
N._1Sa26_18="And he added, \"Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done, and what wrong am I guilty of?";
N._1Sa26_19="Now let my lord the king listen to his servant's words. If the Lord has incited you against me, then may he accept an offering. If, however, men have done it, may they be cursed before the Lord ! They have now driven me from my share in the Lord 's inheritance and have said, 'Go, serve other gods.'";
N._1Sa26_20="Now do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the Lord . The king of Israel has come out to look for a flea - as one hunts a partridge in the mountains.\"";
N._1Sa26_21="Then Saul said, \"I have sinned. Come back, David my son. Because you considered my life precious today, I will not try to harm you again. Surely I have acted like a fool and have erred greatly.\"";
N._1Sa26_22="\"Here is the king's spear,\" David answered. \"Let one of your young men come over and get it.";
N._1Sa26_23="The Lord rewards every man for his righteousness and faithfulness. The Lord delivered you into my hands today, but I would not lay a hand on the Lord 's anointed.";
N._1Sa26_24="As surely as I valued your life today, so may the Lord value my life and deliver me from all trouble.\"";
N._1Sa26_25="Then Saul said to David, \"May you be blessed, my son David; you will do great things and surely triumph.\" So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.";
N._1Sa27_1="But David thought to himself, \"One of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me anywhere in Israel, and I will slip out of his hand.\"";
N._1Sa27_2="So David and the six hundred men with him left and went over to Achish son of Maoch king of Gath.";
N._1Sa27_3="David and his men settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal.";
N._1Sa27_4="When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him.";
N._1Sa27_5="Then David said to Achish, \"If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns, that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?\"";
N._1Sa27_6="So on that day Achish gave him Ziklag, and it has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since.";
N._1Sa27_7="David lived in Philistine territory a year and four months.";
N._1Sa27_8="Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these peoples had lived in the land extending to Shur and Egypt.)";
N._1Sa27_9="Whenever David attacked an area, he did not leave a man or woman alive, but took sheep and cattle, donkeys and camels, and clothes. Then he returned to Achish.";
N._1Sa27_10="When Achish asked, \"Where did you go raiding today?\" David would say, \"Against the Negev of Judah\" or \"Against the Negev of Jerahmeel\" or \"Against the Negev of the Kenites.\"";
N._1Sa27_11="He did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath, for he thought, \"They might inform on us and say, 'This is what David did.' \" And such was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory.";
N._1Sa27_12="Achish trusted David and said to himself, \"He has become so odious to his people, the Israelites, that he will be my servant forever.\"";

N._1Sa28_3="Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land.";
N._1Sa28_4="The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul gathered all the Israelites and set up camp at Gilboa.";
N._1Sa28_5="When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart.";

N._1Sa28_14="\"What does he look like?\" he asked. \"An old man wearing a robe is coming up,\" she said. Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.";
N._1Sa28_15="Samuel said to Saul, \"Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?\" \"I am in great distress,\" Saul said. \"The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has turned away from me.
