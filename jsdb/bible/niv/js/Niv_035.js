N._1Sa9_23="Samuel said to the cook, \"Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you to lay aside.\"";
N._1Sa9_24="So the cook took up the leg with what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, \"Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion, from the time I said, 'I have invited guests.' \" And Saul dined with Samuel that day.";
N._1Sa9_25="After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house.";
N._1Sa9_26="They rose about daybreak and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, \"Get ready, and I will send you on your way.\" When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together.";
N._1Sa9_27="As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, \"Tell the servant to go on ahead of us\"-and the servant did so-\"but you stay here awhile, so that I may give you a message from God.\"";
N._1Sa10_1="Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on Saul's head and kissed him, saying, \"Has not the Lord anointed you leader over his inheritance?";
N._1Sa10_2="When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel's tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, 'The donkeys you set out to look for have been found.

N._1Sa10_3="\"Then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there. One will be carrying three young goats, another three loaves of bread, and another a skin of wine.";
N._1Sa10_4="They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from them.";
N._1Sa10_5="\"After that you will go to Gibeah of God, where there is a Philistine outpost. As you approach the town, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres, tambourines, flutes and harps being played before them, and they will be prophesying.";
N._1Sa10_6="The Spirit of the Lord will come upon you in power, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be changed into a different person.";

N._1Sa10_9="As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul's heart, and all these signs were fulfilled that day.";
N._1Sa10_10="When they arrived at Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came upon him in power, and he joined in their prophesying.";
N._1Sa10_11="When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, \"What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?\"";
N._1Sa10_12="A man who lived there answered, \"And who is their father?\" So it became a saying: \"Is Saul also among the prophets?\"";
N._1Sa10_13="After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the high place.";
N._1Sa10_14="Now Saul's uncle asked him and his servant, \"Where have you been?\" \"Looking for the donkeys,\" he said. \"But when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.\"";
N._1Sa10_15="Saul's uncle said, \"Tell me what Samuel said to you.\"";
N._1Sa10_16="Saul replied, \"He assured us that the donkeys had been found.\" But he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship.";
N._1Sa10_17="Samuel summoned the people of Israel to the Lord at Mizpah";
N._1Sa10_18="and said to them, \"This is what the Lord , the God of Israel, says: 'I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the power of Egypt and all the kingdoms that oppressed you.'";
N._1Sa10_19="But you have now rejected your God, who saves you out of all your calamities and distresses. And you have said, 'No, set a king over us.' So now present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and clans.\"";
N._1Sa10_20="When Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.";
N._1Sa10_21="Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, and Matri's clan was chosen. Finally Saul son of Kish was chosen. But when they looked for him, he was not to be found.";
N._1Sa10_22="So they inquired further of the Lord , \"Has the man come here yet?\" And the Lord said, \"Yes, he has hidden himself among the baggage.\"";
N._1Sa10_23="They ran and brought him out, and as he stood among the people he was a head taller than any of the others.";
N._1Sa10_24="Samuel said to all the people, \"Do you see the man the Lord has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people.\" Then the people shouted, \"Long live the king!\"";
N._1Sa10_25="Samuel explained to the people the regulations of the kingship. He wrote them down on a scroll and deposited it before the Lord . Then Samuel dismissed the people, each to his own home.";
N._1Sa10_26="Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by valiant men whose hearts God had touched.";
N._1Sa10_27="But some troublemakers said, \"How can this fellow save us?\" They despised him and brought him no gifts. But Saul kept silent.";
N._1Sa11_1="Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh Gilead. And all the men of Jabesh said to him, \"Make a treaty with us, and we will be subject to you.\"";

N._1Sa11_3="The elders of Jabesh said to him, \"Give us seven days so we can send messengers throughout Israel; if no one comes to rescue us, we will surrender to you.\"";
N._1Sa11_4="When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and reported these terms to the people, they all wept aloud.";
N._1Sa11_5="Just then Saul was returning from the fields, behind his oxen, and he asked, \"What is wrong with the people? Why are they weeping?\" Then they repeated to him what the men of Jabesh had said.";
N._1Sa11_6="When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God came upon him in power, and he burned with anger.";
N._1Sa11_7="He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent the pieces by messengers throughout Israel, proclaiming, \"This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel.\" Then the terror of the Lord fell on the people, and they turned out as one man.";
N._1Sa11_8="When Saul mustered them at Bezek, the men of Israel numbered three hundred thousand and the men of Judah thirty thousand.";
N._1Sa11_9="They told the messengers who had come, \"Say to the men of Jabesh Gilead, 'By the time the sun is hot tomorrow, you will be delivered.' \" When the messengers went and reported this to the men of Jabesh, they were elated.";
N._1Sa11_10="They said to the Ammonites, \"Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever seems good to you.\"";
N._1Sa11_11="The next day Saul separated his men into three divisions; during the last watch of the night they broke into the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them until the heat of the day. Those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.";
N._1Sa11_12="The people then said to Samuel, \"Who was it that asked, 'Shall Saul reign over us?' Bring these men to us and we will put them to death.\"";
N._1Sa11_13="But Saul said, \"No one shall be put to death today, for this day the Lord has rescued Israel.\"";
N._1Sa11_14="Then Samuel said to the people, \"Come, let us go to Gilgal and there reaffirm the kingship.\"";
N._1Sa11_15="So all the people went to Gilgal and confirmed Saul as king in the presence of the Lord . There they sacrificed fellowship offerings before the Lord , and Saul and all the Israelites held a great celebration.";
N._1Sa12_1="Samuel said to all Israel, \"I have listened to everything you said to me and have set a king over you.";
N._1Sa12_2="Now you have a king as your leader. As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have been your leader from my youth until this day.";
N._1Sa12_3="Here I stand. Testify against me in the presence of the Lord and his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed?

N._1Sa12_4="\"You have not cheated or oppressed us,\" they replied. \"You have not taken anything from anyone's hand.\"";
N._1Sa12_5="Samuel said to them, \"The Lord is witness against you, and also his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.\" \"He is witness,\" they said.";

N._1Sa13_1="Saul was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty- two years.";
N._1Sa13_2="Saul chose three thousand men from Israel; two thousand were with him at Micmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. The rest of the men he sent back to their homes.";
N._1Sa13_3="Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said, \"Let the Hebrews hear!\"";

N._1Sa13_5="The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven.";

N._1Sa13_7="Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops with him were quaking with fear.";
N._1Sa13_8="He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul's men began to scatter.";
N._1Sa13_9="So he said, \"Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings. \" And Saul offered up the burnt offering.";
N._1Sa13_10="Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him.";
N._1Sa13_11="\"What have you done?\" asked Samuel. Saul replied, \"When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Micmash,";
N._1Sa13_12="I thought, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the Lord 's favor.' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.\"";
N._1Sa13_13="\"You acted foolishly,\" Samuel said. \"You have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.";
N._1Sa13_14="But now your kingdom will not endure; the Lord has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people, because you have not kept the Lord 's command.\"";

N._1Sa13_16="Saul and his son Jonathan and the men with them were staying in Gibeah in Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Micmash.";

N._1Sa13_19="Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, \"Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!\"";

N._1Sa14_2="Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men,";
N._1Sa14_3="among whom was Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod's brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the Lord 's priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that Jonathan had left.";

N._1Sa14_13="Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him.";
N._1Sa14_14="In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre.";
N._1Sa14_15="Then panic struck the whole armythose in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties - and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God.";
N._1Sa14_16="Saul's lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions.";
N._1Sa14_17="Then Saul said to the men who were with him, \"Muster the forces and see who has left us.\" When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there.";
N._1Sa14_18="Saul said to Ahijah, \"Bring the ark of God.\" (At that time it was with the Israelites.)";
N._1Sa14_19="While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, \"Withdraw your hand.\"";

N._1Sa14_21="Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.";
N._1Sa14_22="When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit.";
N._1Sa14_23="So the Lord rescued Israel that day, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven.";
N._1Sa14_24="Now the men of Israel were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, \"Cursed be any man who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!\" So none of the troops tasted food.";
N._1Sa14_25="The entire army entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground.";
N._1Sa14_26="When they went into the woods, they saw the honey oozing out, yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath.";
N._1Sa14_27="But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.";

N._1Sa14_31="That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Micmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted.";
N._1Sa14_32="They pounced on the plunder and, taking sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate them, together with the blood.";

N._1Sa14_46="Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land.";
N._1Sa14_47="After Saul had assumed rule over Israel, he fought against their enemies on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment on them.";

N._1Sa15_32="Then Samuel said, \"Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.\" Agag came to him confidently, thinking, \"Surely the bitterness of death is past.\"";
N._1Sa15_33="But Samuel said, \"As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women.\" And Samuel put Agag to death before the Lord at Gilgal.";
N._1Sa15_34="Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul.";
N._1Sa15_35="Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him. And the Lord was grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.";
N._1Sa16_1="The Lord said to Samuel, \"How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his sons to be king.\"";
N._1Sa16_2="But Samuel said, \"How can I go? Saul will hear about it and kill me.\" The Lord said, \"Take a heifer with you and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the Lord .'";
N._1Sa16_3="Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I indicate.\"";
N._1Sa16_4="Samuel did what the Lord said. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town trembled when they met him. They asked, \"Do you come in peace?\"";
