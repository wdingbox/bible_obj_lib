N._1Sa1_17="Eli answered, \"Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him.\"";
N._1Sa1_18="She said, \"May your servant find favor in your eyes.\" Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.";
N._1Sa1_19="Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the Lord and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah lay with Hannah his wife, and the Lord remembered her.";
N._1Sa1_20="So in the course of time Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, \"Because I asked the Lord for him.\"";
N._1Sa1_21="When the man Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the Lord and to fulfill his vow,";
N._1Sa1_22="Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, \"After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the Lord , and he will live there always.\"";
N._1Sa1_23="\"Do what seems best to you,\" Elkanah her husband told her. \"Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the Lord make good his word.\" So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.";
N._1Sa1_24="After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh.";
N._1Sa1_25="When they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli,";
N._1Sa1_26="and she said to him, \"As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the Lord .";
N._1Sa1_27="I prayed for this child, and the Lord has granted me what I asked of him.";
N._1Sa1_28="So now I give him to the Lord . For his whole life he will be given over to the Lord .\" And he worshiped the Lord there.";
N._1Sa2_1="Then Hannah prayed and said: \"My heart rejoices in the Lord ; in the Lord my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance.";
N._1Sa2_2="\"There is no one holy like the Lord ; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God.";
N._1Sa2_3="\"Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the Lord is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed.";
N._1Sa2_4="\"The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength.";
N._1Sa2_5="Those who were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry hunger no more. She who was barren has borne seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away.";
N._1Sa2_6="\"The Lord brings death and makes alive; he brings down to the grave and raises up.";
N._1Sa2_7="The Lord sends poverty and wealth; he humbles and he exalts.";
N._1Sa2_8="He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. \"For the foundations of the earth are the Lord 's; upon them he has set the world.";
N._1Sa2_9="He will guard the feet of his saints, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness. \"It is not by strength that one prevails;";
N._1Sa2_10="those who oppose the Lord will be shattered. He will thunder against them from heaven; the Lord will judge the ends of the earth. \"He will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed.\"";
N._1Sa2_11="Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy ministered before the Lord under Eli the priest.";
N._1Sa2_12="Eli's sons were wicked men; they had no regard for the Lord .";
N._1Sa2_13="Now it was the practice of the priests with the people that whenever anyone offered a sacrifice and while the meat was being boiled, the servant of the priest would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand.";
N._1Sa2_14="He would plunge it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot, and the priest would take for himself whatever the fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.";
N._1Sa2_15="But even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, \"Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.\"";
N._1Sa2_16="If the man said to him, \"Let the fat be burned up first, and then take whatever you want,\" the servant would then answer, \"No, hand it over now; if you don't, I'll take it by force.\"";
N._1Sa2_17="This sin of the young men was very great in the Lord 's sight, for they were treating the Lord 's offering with contempt.";
N._1Sa2_18="But Samuel was ministering before the Lord -a boy wearing a linen ephod.";
N._1Sa2_19="Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.";
N._1Sa2_20="Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, \"May the Lord give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the Lord .\" Then they would go home.";
N._1Sa2_21="And the Lord was gracious to Hannah; she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the Lord .";
N._1Sa2_22="Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.";
N._1Sa2_23="So he said to them, \"Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours.";
N._1Sa2_24="No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the Lord 's people.";
N._1Sa2_25="If a man sins against another man, God may mediate for him; but if a man sins against the Lord , who will intercede for him?\" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the Lord 's will to put them to death.";
N._1Sa2_26="And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the Lord and with men.";
N._1Sa2_27="Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, \"This is what the Lord says: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh?";
N._1Sa2_28="I chose your father out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your father's house all the offerings made with fire by the Israelites.";
N._1Sa2_29="Why do you scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?'";
N._1Sa2_30="\"Therefore the Lord , the God of Israel, declares: 'I promised that your house and your father's house would minister before me forever.' But now the Lord declares: 'Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained.";
N._1Sa2_31="The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your family line";
N._1Sa2_32="and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, in your family line there will never be an old man.";
N._1Sa2_33="Every one of you that I do not cut off from my altar will be spared only to blind your eyes with tears and to grieve your heart, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life.";
N._1Sa2_34="\" 'And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you-they will both die on the same day.";
N._1Sa2_35="I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his house, and he will minister before my anointed one always.";
N._1Sa2_36="Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a crust of bread and plead, \"Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat.\" ' \"";
N._1Sa3_1="The boy Samuel ministered before the Lord under Eli. In those days the word of the Lord was rare; there were not many visions.";
N._1Sa3_2="One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place.";
N._1Sa3_3="The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the Lord , where the ark of God was.";
N._1Sa3_4="Then the Lord called Samuel. Samuel answered, \"Here I am.\"";
N._1Sa3_5="And he ran to Eli and said, \"Here I am; you called me.\" But Eli said, \"I did not call; go back and lie down.\" So he went and lay down.";
N._1Sa3_6="Again the Lord called, \"Samuel!\" And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, \"Here I am; you called me.\" \"My son,\" Eli said, \"I did not call; go back and lie down.\"";
N._1Sa3_7="Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord : The word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him.";
N._1Sa3_8="The Lord called Samuel a third time, and Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, \"Here I am; you called me.\" Then Eli realized that the Lord was calling the boy.";
N._1Sa3_9="So Eli told Samuel, \"Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, 'Speak, Lord , for your servant is listening.' \" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.";
N._1Sa3_10="The Lord came and stood there, calling as at the other times, \"Samuel! Samuel!\" Then Samuel said, \"Speak, for your servant is listening.\"";
N._1Sa3_11="And the Lord said to Samuel: \"See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle.";
N._1Sa3_12="At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his familyfrom beginning to end.";
N._1Sa3_13="For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons made themselves contemptible, and he failed to restrain them.";
N._1Sa3_14="Therefore, I swore to the house of Eli, 'The guilt of Eli's house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.' \"";
N._1Sa3_15="Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the Lord . He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,";
N._1Sa3_16="but Eli called him and said, \"Samuel, my son.\" Samuel answered, \"Here I am.\"";
N._1Sa3_17="\"What was it he said to you?\" Eli asked. \"Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you.\"";
N._1Sa3_18="So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, \"He is the Lord ; let him do what is good in his eyes.\"";
N._1Sa3_19="The Lord was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of his words fall to the ground.";
N._1Sa3_20="And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the Lord .";
N._1Sa3_21="The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word.";
N._1Sa4_1="And Samuel's word came to all Israel. Now the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek.";
N._1Sa4_2="The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield.";
N._1Sa4_3="When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, \"Why did the Lord bring defeat upon us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the Lord 's covenant from Shiloh, so that it may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies.\"";
N._1Sa4_4="So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the Lord Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.";
N._1Sa4_5="When the ark of the Lord 's covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook.";
N._1Sa4_6="Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, \"What's all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?\" When they learned that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp,";
N._1Sa4_7="the Philistines were afraid. \"A god has come into the camp,\" they said. \"We're in trouble! Nothing like this has happened before.";
N._1Sa4_8="Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the desert.";
N._1Sa4_9="Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!\"";
N._1Sa4_10="So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers.";
N._1Sa4_11="The ark of God was captured, and Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.";
N._1Sa4_12="That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line and went to Shiloh, his clothes torn and dust on his head.";
N._1Sa4_13="When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road, watching, because his heart feared for the ark of God. When the man entered the town and told what had happened, the whole town sent up a cry.";
N._1Sa4_14="Eli heard the outcry and asked, \"What is the meaning of this uproar?\" The man hurried over to Eli,";
N._1Sa4_15="who was ninety-eight years old and whose eyes were set so that he could not see.";
N._1Sa4_16="He told Eli, \"I have just come from the battle line; I fled from it this very day.\" Eli asked, \"What happened, my son?\"";
N._1Sa4_17="The man who brought the news replied, \"Israel fled before the Philistines, and the army has suffered heavy losses. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.\"";
N._1Sa4_18="When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man and heavy. He had led Israel forty years.";
N._1Sa4_19="His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth, but was overcome by her labor pains.";
N._1Sa4_20="As she was dying, the women attending her said, \"Don't despair; you have given birth to a son.\" But she did not respond or pay any attention.";
N._1Sa4_21="She named the boy Ichabod, saying, \"The glory has departed from Israel\"- because of the capture of the ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.";
N._1Sa4_22="She said, \"The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.\"";
N._1Sa5_1="After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.";
N._1Sa5_2="Then they carried the ark into Dagon's temple and set it beside Dagon.";
N._1Sa5_3="When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord ! They took Dagon and put him back in his place.";
N._1Sa5_4="But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord ! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained.";
N._1Sa5_5="That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon's temple at Ashdod step on the threshold.";
N._1Sa5_6="The Lord 's hand was heavy upon the people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he brought devastation upon them and afflicted them with tumors.";
N._1Sa5_7="When the men of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, \"The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy upon us and upon Dagon our god.\"";
N._1Sa5_8="So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, \"What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?\" They answered, \"Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath.\" So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.";
N._1Sa5_9="But after they had moved it, the Lord 's hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors.";
N._1Sa5_10="So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. As the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, \"They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people.\"";
N._1Sa5_11="So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, \"Send the ark of the god of Israel away; let it go back to its own place, or it will kill us and our people.\" For death had filled the city with panic; God's hand was very heavy upon it.";
N._1Sa5_12="Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.";
N._1Sa6_1="When the ark of the Lord had been in Philistine territory seven months,";
N._1Sa6_2="the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, \"What shall we do with the ark of the Lord ? Tell us how we should send it back to its place.\"";
N._1Sa6_3="They answered, \"If you return the ark of the god of Israel, do not send it away empty, but by all means send a guilt offering to him. Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you.\"";
N._1Sa6_4="The Philistines asked, \"What guilt offering should we send to him?\" They replied, \"Five gold tumors and five gold rats, according to the number of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers.";
N._1Sa6_5="Make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country, and pay honor to Israel's god. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land.";
N._1Sa6_6="Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When he treated them harshly, did they not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way?";
N._1Sa6_7="\"Now then, get a new cart ready, with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up.";
N._1Sa6_8="Take the ark of the Lord and put it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering. Send it on its way,";
N._1Sa6_9="but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory, toward Beth Shemesh, then the Lord has brought this great disaster on us. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us and that it happened to us by chance.\"";
N._1Sa6_10="So they did this. They took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves.";
N._1Sa6_11="They placed the ark of the Lord on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumors.";
N._1Sa6_12="Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and lowing all the way; they did not turn to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh.";
N._1Sa6_13="Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they rejoiced at the sight.";
N._1Sa6_14="The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and there it stopped beside a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord .";
N._1Sa6_15="The Levites took down the ark of the Lord , together with the chest containing the gold objects, and placed them on the large rock. On that day the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the Lord .";
N._1Sa6_16="The five rulers of the Philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to Ekron.";
N._1Sa6_17="These are the gold tumors the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the Lord -one each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron.";
N._1Sa6_18="And the number of the gold rats was according to the number of Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers - the fortified towns with their country villages. The large rock, on which they set the ark of the Lord , is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.";
N._1Sa6_19="But God struck down some of the men of Beth Shemesh, putting seventy of them to death because they had looked into the ark of the Lord . The people mourned because of the heavy blow the Lord had dealt them,";
N._1Sa6_20="and the men of Beth Shemesh asked, \"Who can stand in the presence of the Lord , this holy God? To whom will the ark go up from here?\"";
N._1Sa6_21="Then they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath Jearim, saying, \"The Philistines have returned the ark of the Lord . Come down and take it up to your place.\"";
N._1Sa7_1="So the men of Kiriath Jearim came and took up the ark of the Lord . They took it to Abinadab's house on the hill and consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the Lord .";
N._1Sa7_2="It was a long time, twenty years in all, that the ark remained at Kiriath Jearim, and all the people of Israel mourned and sought after the Lord .";
N._1Sa7_3="And Samuel said to the whole house of Israel, \"If you are returning to the Lord with all your hearts, then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths and commit yourselves to the Lord and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.\"";
N._1Sa7_4="So the Israelites put away their Baals and Ashtoreths, and served the Lord only.";
N._1Sa7_5="Then Samuel said, \"Assemble all Israel at Mizpah and I will intercede with the Lord for you.\"";
N._1Sa7_6="When they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the Lord . On that day they fasted and there they confessed, \"We have sinned against the Lord .\" And Samuel was leader of Israel at Mizpah.";
N._1Sa7_7="When the Philistines heard that Israel had assembled at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines came up to attack them. And when the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid because of the Philistines.";
N._1Sa7_8="They said to Samuel, \"Do not stop crying out to the Lord our God for us, that he may rescue us from the hand of the Philistines.\"";
N._1Sa7_9="Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it up as a whole burnt offering to the Lord . He cried out to the Lord on Israel's behalf, and the Lord answered him.";
N._1Sa7_10="While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to engage Israel in battle. But that day the Lord thundered with loud thunder against the Philistines and threw them into such a panic that they were routed before the Israelites.";
N._1Sa7_11="The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, slaughtering them along the way to a point below Beth Car.";
N._1Sa7_12="Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, \"Thus far has the Lord helped us.\"";
N._1Sa7_13="So the Philistines were subdued and did not invade Israelite territory again. Throughout Samuel's lifetime, the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines.";
N._1Sa7_14="The towns from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had captured from Israel were restored to her, and Israel delivered the neighboring territory from the power of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.";
N._1Sa7_15="Samuel continued as judge over Israel all the days of his life.";
N._1Sa7_16="From year to year he went on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places.";
N._1Sa7_17="But he always went back to Ramah, where his home was, and there he also judged Israel. And he built an altar there to the Lord .";
N._1Sa8_1="When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges for Israel.";
N._1Sa8_2="The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second was Abijah, and they served at Beersheba.";
N._1Sa8_3="But his sons did not walk in his ways. They turned aside after dishonest gain and accepted bribes and perverted justice.";
N._1Sa8_4="So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah.";
N._1Sa8_5="They said to him, \"You are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways; now appoint a king to lead us, such as all the other nations have.\"";
N._1Sa8_6="But when they said, \"Give us a king to lead us,\" this displeased Samuel; so he prayed to the Lord .";
N._1Sa8_7="And the Lord told him: \"Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king.";
N._1Sa8_8="As they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you.";
N._1Sa8_9="Now listen to them; but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will do.\"";
N._1Sa8_10="Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people who were asking him for a king.";
N._1Sa8_11="He said, \"This is what the king who will reign over you will do: He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses, and they will run in front of his chariots.";
N._1Sa8_12="Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.";
N._1Sa8_13="He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.";
N._1Sa8_14="He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants.";
N._1Sa8_15="He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants.";
N._1Sa8_16="Your menservants and maidservants and the best of your cattle and donkeys he will take for his own use.";
N._1Sa8_17="He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves.";
N._1Sa8_18="When that day comes, you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen, and the Lord will not answer you in that day.\"";
N._1Sa8_19="But the people refused to listen to Samuel. \"No!\" they said. \"We want a king over us.";
N._1Sa8_20="Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles.\"";
N._1Sa8_21="When Samuel heard all that the people said, he repeated it before the Lord .";
N._1Sa8_22="The Lord answered, \"Listen to them and give them a king.\" Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, \"Everyone go back to his town.\"";
N._1Sa9_1="There was a Benjamite, a man of standing, whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin.";
N._1Sa9_2="He had a son named Saul, an impressive young man without equal among the Israelites - a head taller than any of the others.";
N._1Sa9_3="Now the donkeys belonging to Saul's father Kish were lost, and Kish said to his son Saul, \"Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys.\"";
N._1Sa9_4="So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha, but they did not find them. They went on into the district of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin, but they did not find them.";
N._1Sa9_5="When they reached the district of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, \"Come, let's go back, or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us.\"";
N._1Sa9_6="But the servant replied, \"Look, in this town there is a man of God; he is highly respected, and everything he says comes true. Let's go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take.\"";
N._1Sa9_7="Saul said to his servant, \"If we go, what can we give the man? The food in our sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?\"";
N._1Sa9_8="The servant answered him again. \"Look,\" he said, \"I have a quarter of a shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us what way to take.\"";
N._1Sa9_9="(Formerly in Israel, if a man went to inquire of God, he would say, \"Come, let us go to the seer,\" because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.)";
N._1Sa9_10="\"Good,\" Saul said to his servant. \"Come, let's go.\" So they set out for the town where the man of God was.";
N._1Sa9_11="As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some girls coming out to draw water, and they asked them, \"Is the seer here?\"";
N._1Sa9_12="\"He is,\" they answered. \"He's ahead of you. Hurry now; he has just come to our town today, for the people have a sacrifice at the high place.";
N._1Sa9_13="As soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not begin eating until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward, those who are invited will eat. Go up now; you should find him about this time.\"";
N._1Sa9_14="They went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place.";
N._1Sa9_15="Now the day before Saul came, the Lord had revealed this to Samuel:";
