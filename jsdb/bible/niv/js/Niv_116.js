N._Luk5_1="One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, with the people crowding around him and listening to the word of God,";
N._Luk5_2="he saw at the water's edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets.";
N._Luk5_3="He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.";
N._Luk5_4="When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, \"Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.\"";
N._Luk5_5="Simon answered, \"Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.\"";
N._Luk5_6="When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.";
N._Luk5_7="So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.";
N._Luk5_8="When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, \"Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!\"";

N._Luk5_10="and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners.";
N._Luk5_11="Then Jesus said to Simon, \"Don't be afraid; from now on you will catch men.\" So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.";
N._Luk5_12="While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, \"Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.\"";
N._Luk5_13="Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. \"I am willing,\" he said. \"Be clean!\" And immediately the leprosy left him.";
N._Luk5_14="Then Jesus ordered him, \"Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.\"";

N._Luk5_19="When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.";
N._Luk5_20="When Jesus saw their faith, he said, \"Friend, your sins are forgiven.\"";
N._Luk5_21="The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, \"Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?\"";

N._Luk6_8="But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, \"Get up and stand in front of everyone.\" So he got up and stood there.";

N._Luk6_10="He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" He did so, and his hand was completely restored.";
N._Luk6_11="But they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.";

N._Luk7_1="When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.";
N._Luk7_2="There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.";

N._Luk9_18="Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, \"Who do the crowds say I am?\"";
N._Luk9_19="They replied, \"Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.\"";
N._Luk9_20="\"But what about you?\" he asked. \"Who do you say I am?\" Peter answered, \"The Christ of God.\"";
N._Luk9_21="Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.";
N._Luk9_22="And he said, \"The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.\"";
N._Luk9_23="Then he said to them all: \"If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.";
N._Luk9_24="For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it.";
N._Luk9_25="What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self?";
N._Luk9_26="If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.";
N._Luk9_27="I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\"";
N._Luk9_28="About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray.";
