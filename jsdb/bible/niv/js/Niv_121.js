N._Jhn6_63="The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.";
N._Jhn6_64="Yet there are some of you who do not believe.\" For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him.";
N._Jhn6_65="He went on to say, \"This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him.\"";
N._Jhn6_66="From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.";
N._Jhn6_67="\"You do not want to leave too, do you?\" Jesus asked the Twelve.";
N._Jhn6_68="Simon Peter answered him, \"Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.";
N._Jhn6_69="We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.\"";
N._Jhn6_70="Then Jesus replied, \"Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!\"";
N._Jhn6_71="(He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)";
N._Jhn7_1="After this, Jesus went around in Galilee, purposely staying away from Judea because the Jews there were waiting to take his life.";
N._Jhn7_2="But when the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near,";
N._Jhn7_3="Jesus' brothers said to him, \"You ought to leave here and go to Judea, so that your disciples may see the miracles you do.";
N._Jhn7_4="No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.\"";
N._Jhn7_5="For even his own brothers did not believe in him.";
N._Jhn7_6="Therefore Jesus told them, \"The right time for me has not yet come; for you any time is right.";
N._Jhn7_7="The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that what it does is evil.";
N._Jhn7_8="You go to the Feast. I am not yet going up to this Feast, because for me the right time has not yet come.\"";
N._Jhn7_9="Having said this, he stayed in Galilee.";
N._Jhn7_10="However, after his brothers had left for the Feast, he went also, not publicly, but in secret.";
N._Jhn7_11="Now at the Feast the Jews were watching for him and asking, \"Where is that man?\"";
N._Jhn7_12="Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, \"He is a good man.\"";
N._Jhn7_13="Others replied, \"No, he deceives the people.\" But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the Jews.";
N._Jhn7_14="Not until halfway through the Feast did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach.";
N._Jhn7_15="The Jews were amazed and asked, \"How did this man get such learning without having studied?\"";
N._Jhn7_16="Jesus answered, \"My teaching is not my own. It comes from him who sent me.";
N._Jhn7_17="If anyone chooses to do God's will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.";
N._Jhn7_18="He who speaks on his own does so to gain honor for himself, but he who works for the honor of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.";
N._Jhn7_19="Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?\"";
N._Jhn7_20="\"You are demon-possessed,\" the crowd answered. \"Who is trying to kill you?\"";
N._Jhn7_21="Jesus said to them, \"I did one miracle, and you are all astonished.";
N._Jhn7_22="Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a child on the Sabbath.";
N._Jhn7_23="Now if a child can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing the whole man on the Sabbath?";
N._Jhn7_24="Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment.\"";
N._Jhn7_25="At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, \"Isn't this the man they are trying to kill?";
N._Jhn7_26="Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Christ ?";
N._Jhn7_27="But we know where this man is from; when the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from.\"";
N._Jhn7_28="Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, \"Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him,";
N._Jhn7_29="but I know him because I am from him and he sent me.\"";
N._Jhn7_30="At this they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come.";
N._Jhn7_31="Still, many in the crowd put their faith in him. They said, \"When the Christ comes, will he do more miraculous signs than this man?\"";
N._Jhn7_32="The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.";
N._Jhn7_33="Jesus said, \"I am with you for only a short time, and then I go to the one who sent me.";
N._Jhn7_34="You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come.\"";
N._Jhn7_35="The Jews said to one another, \"Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?";
N._Jhn7_36="What did he mean when he said, 'You will look for me, but you will not find me,' and 'Where I am, you cannot come'?\"";
N._Jhn7_37="On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, \"If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.";
N._Jhn7_38="Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him.\"";
N._Jhn7_39="By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.";
N._Jhn7_40="On hearing his words, some of the people said, \"Surely this man is the Prophet.\"";
N._Jhn7_41="Others said, \"He is the Christ.\"";
N._Jhn7_42="Still others asked, \"How can the Christ come from Galilee? Does not the Scripture say that the Christ will come from David's family and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?\"";
N._Jhn7_43="Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.";
N._Jhn7_44="Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.";
N._Jhn7_45="Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, \"Why didn't you bring him in?\"";
N._Jhn7_46="\"No one ever spoke the way this man does,\" the guards declared.";
N._Jhn7_47="\"You mean he has deceived you also?\" the Pharisees retorted.";
N._Jhn7_48="\"Has any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?";
N._Jhn7_49="No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law -- there is a curse on them.\"";
N._Jhn7_50="Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked,";
N._Jhn7_51="\"Does our law condemn anyone without first hearing him to find out what he is doing?\"";
N._Jhn7_52="They replied, \"Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee.\"";
N._Jhn7_53="Then each went to his own home.";
N._Jhn8_1="But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.";
N._Jhn8_2="At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them.";
N._Jhn8_3="The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group";
N._Jhn8_4="and said to Jesus, \"Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.";
N._Jhn8_5="In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?\"";
N._Jhn8_6="They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him.";
N._Jhn8_7="But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, \"If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.\"";
N._Jhn8_8="Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.";
N._Jhn8_9="At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.";
N._Jhn8_10="Jesus straightened up and asked her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\"";
N._Jhn8_11="\"No one, sir,\" she said. \"Then neither do I condemn you,\" Jesus declared. \"Go now and leave your life of sin.\"";
N._Jhn8_12="When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, \"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\"";
N._Jhn8_13="The Pharisees challenged him, \"Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid.\"";
N._Jhn8_14="Jesus answered, \"Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going.";
N._Jhn8_15="You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one.";
N._Jhn8_16="But if I do judge, my decisions are right, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me.";
N._Jhn8_17="In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.";
N._Jhn8_18="I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.\"";
N._Jhn8_19="Then they asked him, \"Where is your father?\"";
N._Jhn8_20="\"You do not know me or my Father,\" Jesus replied. \"If you knew me, you would know my Father also.\" He spoke these words while teaching in the temple area near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his time had not yet come.";
N._Jhn8_21="Once more Jesus said to them, \"I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come.\"";
N._Jhn8_22="This made the Jews ask, \"Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come'?\"";
N._Jhn8_23="But he continued, \"You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.";
N._Jhn8_24="I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will indeed die in your sins.\"";
N._Jhn8_25="\"Who are you?\" they asked.";
N._Jhn8_26="\"Just what I have been claiming all along,\" Jesus replied. \"I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is reliable, and what I have heard from him I tell the world.\"";
N._Jhn8_27="They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.";
N._Jhn8_28="So Jesus said, \"When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am the one I claim to be and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.";
N._Jhn8_29="The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him.\"";
N._Jhn8_30="Even as he spoke, many put their faith in him.";
N._Jhn8_31="To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, \"If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.";
N._Jhn8_32="Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\"";
N._Jhn8_33="They answered him, \"We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?\"";
N._Jhn8_34="Jesus replied, \"I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.";
N._Jhn8_35="Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.";
N._Jhn8_36="So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.";
N._Jhn8_37="I know you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are ready to kill me, because you have no room for my word.";
N._Jhn8_38="I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you do what you have heard from your father. \"";
N._Jhn8_39="\"Abraham is our father,\" they answered. \"If you were Abraham's children,\" said Jesus, \"then you would";
N._Jhn8_40="do the things Abraham did. As it is, you are determined to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.";
N._Jhn8_41="You are doing the things your own father does.\" \"We are not illegitimate children,\" they protested. \"The only Father we have is God himself.\"";
N._Jhn8_42="Jesus said to them, \"If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me.";
N._Jhn8_43="Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.";
N._Jhn8_44="You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.";
N._Jhn8_45="Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!";
N._Jhn8_46="Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me?";
N._Jhn8_47="He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.\"";
N._Jhn8_48="The Jews answered him, \"Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?\"";
N._Jhn8_49="\"I am not possessed by a demon,\" said Jesus, \"but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.";
N._Jhn8_50="I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.";
N._Jhn8_51="I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.\"";
N._Jhn8_52="At this the Jews exclaimed, \"Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that if anyone keeps your word, he will never taste death.";
N._Jhn8_53="Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?\"";
N._Jhn8_54="Jesus replied, \"If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.";
N._Jhn8_55="Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word.";
N._Jhn8_56="Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.\"";
N._Jhn8_57="\"You are not yet fifty years old,\" the Jews said to him, \"and you have seen Abraham!\"";
N._Jhn8_58="\"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus answered, \"before Abraham was born, I am!\"";
N._Jhn8_59="At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.";
N._Jhn9_1="As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth.";
N._Jhn9_2="His disciples asked him, \"Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\"";
N._Jhn9_3="\"Neither this man nor his parents sinned,\" said Jesus, \"but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.";
N._Jhn9_4="As long as it is day, we must do the work of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.";
N._Jhn9_5="While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\"";
N._Jhn9_6="Having said this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes.";
N._Jhn9_7="\"Go,\" he told him, \"wash in the Pool of Siloam\" (this word means Sent). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.";
N._Jhn9_8="His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, \"Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?\"";
N._Jhn9_9="Some claimed that he was. Others said, \"No, he only looks like him.\" But he himself insisted, \"I am the man.\"";
N._Jhn9_10="\"How then were your eyes opened?\" they demanded.";
N._Jhn9_11="He replied, \"The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.\"";
N._Jhn9_12="\"Where is this man?\" they asked him. \"I don't know,\" he said.";
N._Jhn9_13="They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.";
N._Jhn9_14="Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath.";
N._Jhn9_15="Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. \"He put mud on my eyes,\" the man replied, \"and I washed, and now I see.\"";
N._Jhn9_16="Some of the Pharisees said, \"This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.\" But others asked, \"How can a sinner do such miraculous signs?\" So they were divided.";
N._Jhn9_17="Finally they turned again to the blind man, \"What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened.\" The man replied, \"He is a prophet.\"";
N._Jhn9_18="The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents.";
N._Jhn9_19="\"Is this your son?\" they asked. \"Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?\"";
N._Jhn9_20="\"We know he is our son,\" the parents answered, \"and we know he was born blind.";
N._Jhn9_21="But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.\"";
N._Jhn9_22="His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be put out of the synagogue.";
N._Jhn9_23="That was why his parents said, \"He is of age; ask him.\"";
N._Jhn9_24="A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. \"Give glory to God, \" they said. \"We know this man is a sinner.\"";
N._Jhn9_25="He replied, \"Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!\"";
N._Jhn9_26="Then they asked him, \"What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\"";
N._Jhn9_27="He answered, \"I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?\"";
N._Jhn9_28="Then they hurled insults at him and said, \"You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses!";
N._Jhn9_29="We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from.\"";
N._Jhn9_30="The man answered, \"Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.";
N._Jhn9_31="We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will.";
N._Jhn9_32="Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.";
N._Jhn9_33="If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.\"";
N._Jhn9_34="To this they replied, \"You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!\" And they threw him out.";
N._Jhn9_35="Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, \"Do you believe in the Son of Man?\"";
N._Jhn9_36="\"Who is he, sir?\" the man asked. \"Tell me so that I may believe in him.\"";
N._Jhn9_37="Jesus said, \"You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.\"";
N._Jhn9_38="Then the man said, \"Lord, I believe,\" and he worshiped him.";
N._Jhn9_39="Jesus said, \"For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.\"";
N._Jhn9_40="Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, \"What? Are we blind too?\"";
N._Jhn9_41="Jesus said, \"If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.";
N._Jhn10_1="\"I tell you the truth, the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber.";
N._Jhn10_2="The man who enters by the gate is the shepherd of his sheep.";

N._Jhn10_5="But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a strangers voice.\"";
N._Jhn10_6="Jesus used this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was telling them.";
N._Jhn10_7="Therefore Jesus said again, \"I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep.";
N._Jhn10_8="All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.";

N._Jhn10_17="The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life -- only to take it up again.";
N._Jhn10_18="No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.\"";
N._Jhn10_19="At these words the Jews were again divided.";
N._Jhn10_20="Many of them said, \"He is demonpossessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?\"";

N._Jhn11_26="and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?\"";
N._Jhn11_27="\"Yes, Lord,\" she told him, \"I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.\"";
N._Jhn11_28="And after she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. \"The Teacher is here,\" she said, \"and is asking for you.\"";
N._Jhn11_29="When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.";
N._Jhn11_30="Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.";
N._Jhn11_31="When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.";
N._Jhn11_32="When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, \"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.\"";
N._Jhn11_33="When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.";
N._Jhn11_34="\"Where have you laid him?\" he asked. \"Come and see, Lord,\" they replied.";
N._Jhn11_35="Jesus wept.";
N._Jhn11_36="Then the Jews said, \"See how he loved him!\"";
N._Jhn11_37="But some of them said, \"Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?\"";
N._Jhn11_38="Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.";
N._Jhn11_39="\"Take away the stone,\" he said. \"But, Lord,\" said Martha, the sister of the dead man, \"by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days.\"";
N._Jhn11_40="Then Jesus said, \"Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?\"";
N._Jhn11_41="So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, \"Father, I thank you that you have heard me.";
N._Jhn11_42="I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.\"";
N._Jhn11_43="When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, \"Lazarus, come out!\"";
N._Jhn11_44="The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, \"Take off the grave clothes and let him go.\"";
N._Jhn11_45="Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him.";
N._Jhn11_46="But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.";
N._Jhn11_47="Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin.";
N._Jhn11_48="\"What are we accomplishing?\" they asked. \"Here is this man performing many miraculous signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.\"";
N._Jhn11_49="Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, \"You know nothing at all!";
N._Jhn11_50="You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.\"";
N._Jhn11_51="He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,";
N._Jhn11_52="and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one.";
N._Jhn11_53="So from that day on they plotted to take his life.";
N._Jhn11_54="Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews. Instead he withdrew to a region near the desert, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.";
N._Jhn11_55="When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover.";
