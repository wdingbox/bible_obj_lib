N._1Co10_20="No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons.";

N._1Co10_30="If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for?";

N._1Co11_4="Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.";

N._1Co11_6="If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head.";
N._1Co11_7="A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.";

N._1Co11_14="Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him,";
N._1Co11_15="but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.";

N._1Co11_22="Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not!";
N._1Co11_23="For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,";
N._1Co11_24="and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\"";
N._1Co11_25="In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\"";

N._1Co12_1="Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.";
N._1Co12_2="You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols.";

N._1Co12_12="The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ.";
N._1Co12_13="For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body -- whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free -- and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.";
N._1Co12_14="Now the body is not made up of one part but of many.";

N._1Co12_20="As it is, there are many parts, but one body.";
N._1Co12_21="The eye cannot say to the hand, \"I don't need you!\" And the head cannot say to the feet, \"I don't need you!\"";
N._1Co12_22="On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,";
N._1Co12_23="and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty,";
N._1Co12_24="while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it,";
N._1Co12_25="so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other.";
N._1Co12_26="If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.";
N._1Co12_27="Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.";
N._1Co12_28="And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, also those having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different kinds of tongues.";
N._1Co12_29="Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?";
N._1Co12_30="Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues ? Do all interpret?";

N._1Co13_6="Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.";
N._1Co13_7="It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.";
N._1Co13_8="Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.";
N._1Co13_9="For we know in part and we prophesy in part,";

N._1Co13_11="When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.";

N._1Co14_1="Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy.";
N._1Co14_2="For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his spirit.";

N._1Co14_4="He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.";
N._1Co14_5="I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified.";

N._1Co14_7="Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes?";
N._1Co14_8="Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?";
N._1Co14_9="So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.";
N._1Co14_10="Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.";
N._1Co14_11="If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me.";
N._1Co14_12="So it is with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church.";
N._1Co14_13="For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says.";
N._1Co14_14="For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.";
N._1Co14_15="So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.";
N._1Co14_16="If you are praising God with your spirit, how can one who finds himself among those who do not understand say \"Amen\" to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?";
N._1Co14_17="You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.";
N._1Co14_18="I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.";
N._1Co14_19="But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.";
N._1Co14_20="Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults.";
N._1Co14_21="In the Law it is written: \"Through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me,\" says the Lord.";
N._1Co14_22="Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers.";
N._1Co14_23="So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?";
N._1Co14_24="But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all,";
N._1Co14_25="and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, \"God is really among you!\"";
N._1Co14_26="What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church.";
N._1Co14_27="If anyone speaks in a tongue, two -- or at the most three -- should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret.";
N._1Co14_28="If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God.";
N._1Co14_29="Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.";
N._1Co14_30="And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop.";
N._1Co14_31="For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.";
N._1Co14_32="The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets.";
N._1Co14_33="For God is not a God of disorder but of peace.";
N._1Co14_34="As in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says.";
N._1Co14_35="If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.";
N._1Co14_36="Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?";
N._1Co14_37="If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.";
N._1Co14_38="If he ignores this, he himself will be ignored.";
N._1Co14_39="Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.";
N._1Co14_40="But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.";
N._1Co15_1="Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand.";
N._1Co15_2="By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.";
N._1Co15_3="For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance : that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,";
N._1Co15_4="that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,";
N._1Co15_5="and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve.";
N._1Co15_6="After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.";
N._1Co15_7="Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,";
N._1Co15_8="and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born.";
N._1Co15_9="For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.";
N._1Co15_10="But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them -- yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.";
N._1Co15_11="Whether, then, it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.";
N._1Co15_12="But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?";
N._1Co15_13="If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.";
N._1Co15_14="And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.";
N._1Co15_15="More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised.";
N._1Co15_16="For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either.";
N._1Co15_17="And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.";
N._1Co15_18="Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.";
N._1Co15_19="If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men.";
N._1Co15_20="But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.";
N._1Co15_21="For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.";
N._1Co15_22="For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.";
N._1Co15_23="But each in his own turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him.";
N._1Co15_24="Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power.";
N._1Co15_25="For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.";
N._1Co15_26="The last enemy to be destroyed is death.";
N._1Co15_27="For he \"has put everything under his feet.\" Now when it says that \"everything\" has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ.";
N._1Co15_28="When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.";
N._1Co15_29="Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them?";
N._1Co15_30="And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour?";
N._1Co15_31="I die every day -- I mean that, brothers-- just as surely as I glory over you in Christ Jesus our Lord.";
N._1Co15_32="If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, \"Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\"";
N._1Co15_33="Do not be misled: \"Bad company corrupts good character.\"";
N._1Co15_34="Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God -- I say this to your shame.";
N._1Co15_35="But someone may ask, \"How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?\"";
N._1Co15_36="How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.";
N._1Co15_37="When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else.";
N._1Co15_38="But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body.";
N._1Co15_39="All flesh is not the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another.";
N._1Co15_40="There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another.";
N._1Co15_41="The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor.";
N._1Co15_42="So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable;";
N._1Co15_43="it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;";
N._1Co15_44="it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.";
N._1Co15_45="So it is written: \"The first man Adam became a living being\" ; the last Adam, a lifegiving spirit.";
N._1Co15_46="The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual.";
N._1Co15_47="The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven.";
N._1Co15_48="As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the man from heaven, so also are those who are of heaven.";
N._1Co15_49="And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the man from heaven.";
N._1Co15_50="I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.";
N._1Co15_51="Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed--";
N._1Co15_52="in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.";
N._1Co15_53="For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.";
N._1Co15_54="When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: \"Death has been swallowed up in victory.\"";
N._1Co15_55="\"Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?\"";
N._1Co15_56="The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.";
N._1Co15_57="But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.";

N._2Co1_10="He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us,";
N._2Co1_11="as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.";
N._2Co1_12="Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to God's grace.";
N._2Co1_13="For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that,";
N._2Co1_14="as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.";
N._2Co1_15="Because I was confident of this, I planned to visit you first so that you might benefit twice.";
N._2Co1_16="I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.";
N._2Co1_17="When I planned this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say, \"Yes, yes\" and \"No, no\"?";
N._2Co1_18="But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not \"Yes\" and \"No.\"";
N._2Co1_19="For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by me and Silas and Timothy, was not \"Yes\" and \"No,\" but in him it has always been \"Yes.\"";
N._2Co1_20="For no matter how many promises God has made, they are \"Yes\" in Christ. And so through him the \"Amen\" is spoken by us to the glory of God.";
N._2Co1_21="Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,";
N._2Co1_22="set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.";
N._2Co1_23="I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.";
N._2Co1_24="Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm.";
N._2Co2_1="So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.";
N._2Co2_2="For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?";
N._2Co2_3="I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy.";
