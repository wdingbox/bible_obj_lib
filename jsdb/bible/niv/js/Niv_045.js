N._1Ki22_24="Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. \"Which way did the spirit from the Lord go when he went from me to speak to you?\" he asked.";
N._1Ki22_25="Micaiah replied, \"You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room.\"";
N._1Ki22_26="The king of Israel then ordered, \"Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king's son";
N._1Ki22_27="and say, 'This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.' \"";
N._1Ki22_28="Micaiah declared, \"If you ever return safely, the Lord has not spoken through me.\" Then he added, \"Mark my words, all you people!\"";
N._1Ki22_29="So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.";
N._1Ki22_30="The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \"I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes.\" So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.";
N._1Ki22_31="Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, \"Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.\"";
N._1Ki22_32="When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, \"Surely this is the king of Israel.\" So they turned to attack him, but when Jehoshaphat cried out,";
N._1Ki22_33="the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel and stopped pursuing him.";
N._1Ki22_34="But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told his chariot driver, \"Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded.\"";
N._1Ki22_35="All day long the battle raged, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. The blood from his wound ran onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died.";
N._1Ki22_36="As the sun was setting, a cry spread through the army: \"Every man to his town; everyone to his land!\"";
N._1Ki22_37="So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried him there.";
N._1Ki22_38="They washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria (where the prostitutes bathed), and the dogs licked up his blood, as the word of the Lord had declared.";
N._1Ki22_39="As for the other events of Ahab's reign, including all he did, the palace he built and inlaid with ivory, and the cities he fortified, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?";
