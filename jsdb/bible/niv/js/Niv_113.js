N._Mak5_7="He shouted at the top of his voice, \"What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me!\"";
N._Mak5_8="For Jesus had said to him, \"Come out of this man, you evil spirit!\"";
N._Mak5_9="Then Jesus asked him, \"What is your name?\"";
N._Mak5_10="\"My name is Legion,\" he replied, \"for we are many.\" And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.";
N._Mak5_11="A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.";
N._Mak5_12="The demons begged Jesus, \"Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.\"";
N._Mak5_13="He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.";
N._Mak5_14="Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.";
N._Mak5_15="When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.";
N._Mak5_16="Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demonpossessed man -- and told about the pigs as well.";
N._Mak5_17="Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.";
N._Mak5_18="As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.";
N._Mak5_19="Jesus did not let him, but said, \"Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.\"";
N._Mak5_20="So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.";
N._Mak5_21="When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.";
N._Mak5_22="Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet";
N._Mak5_23="and pleaded earnestly with him, \"My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.\"";
N._Mak5_24="So Jesus went with him.";
N._Mak5_25="A large crowd followed and pressed around him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.";
N._Mak5_26="She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.";
N._Mak5_27="When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,";
N._Mak5_28="because she thought, \"If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.\"";
N._Mak5_29="Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.";
N._Mak5_30="At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, \"Who touched my clothes?\"";
N._Mak5_31="\"You see the people crowding against you,\" his disciples answered, \"and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?' \"";
N._Mak5_32="But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.";
N._Mak5_33="Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.";
N._Mak5_34="He said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.\"";
N._Mak5_35="While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. \"Your daughter is dead,\" they said. \"Why bother the teacher any more?\"";
N._Mak5_36="Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, \"Don't be afraid; just believe.\"";
N._Mak5_37="He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.";
N._Mak5_38="When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.";
N._Mak5_39="He went in and said to them, \"Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.\"";
N._Mak5_40="But they laughed at him.";
N._Mak5_41="After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. He took her by the hand and said to her, \"Talitha koum!\" (which means, \"Little girl, I say to you, get up!\" ).";
N._Mak5_42="Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.";
N._Mak5_43="He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.";
N._Mak6_1="Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.";
N._Mak6_2="When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed.";
N._Mak6_3="\"Where did this man get these things?\" they asked. \"What's this wisdom that has been given him, that he even does miracles! Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?\" And they took offense at him.";
N._Mak6_4="Jesus said to them, \"Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor.\"";
N._Mak6_5="He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.";
N._Mak6_6="And he was amazed at their lack of faith.";
N._Mak6_7="Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village. Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits.";
N._Mak6_8="These were his instructions: \"Take nothing for the journey except a staff -- no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.";
N._Mak6_9="Wear sandals but not an extra tunic.";
N._Mak6_10="Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.";
N._Mak6_11="And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them.\"";
N._Mak6_12="They went out and preached that people should repent.";
N._Mak6_13="They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.";
N._Mak6_14="King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, \"John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.\"";
N._Mak6_15="Others said, \"He is Elijah.\" And still others claimed, \"He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.\"";
N._Mak6_16="But when Herod heard this, he said, \"John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!\"";
N._Mak6_17="For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.";
N._Mak6_18="For John had been saying to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\"";
N._Mak6_19="So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to,";
N._Mak6_20="because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled ; yet he liked to listen to him.";
N._Mak6_21="Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.";
N._Mak6_22="When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests.";
N._Mak6_23="The king said to the girl, \"Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you.\" And he promised her with an oath, \"Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.\"";
N._Mak6_24="She went out and said to her mother, \"What shall I ask for?\" \"The head of John the Baptist,\" she answered.";
N._Mak6_25="At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: \"I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\"";
N._Mak6_26="The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.";
N._Mak6_27="So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,";
N._Mak6_28="and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.";
N._Mak6_29="On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.";
N._Mak6_30="The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.";
N._Mak6_31="Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, \"Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.\"";
N._Mak6_32="So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.";
N._Mak6_33="But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.";
N._Mak6_34="When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.";
N._Mak6_35="By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. \"This is a remote place,\" they said, \"and it's already very late.";
N._Mak6_36="Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.\"";
N._Mak6_37="But he answered, \"You give them something to eat.\" They said to him, \"That would take eight months of a man's wages ! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?\"";
N._Mak6_38="\"How many loaves do you have?\" he asked. \"Go and see.\" When they found out, they said, \"Five -- and two fish.\"";
N._Mak6_39="Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.";
N._Mak6_40="So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.";
N._Mak6_41="Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.";
N._Mak6_42="They all ate and were satisfied,";
N._Mak6_43="and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.";
N._Mak6_44="The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.";
N._Mak6_45="Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.";
N._Mak6_46="After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.";
N._Mak6_47="When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.";
N._Mak6_48="He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them,";
N._Mak6_49="but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,";
N._Mak6_50="because they all saw him and were terrified.";
N._Mak6_51="Immediately he spoke to them and said, \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.\" Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed,";
N._Mak6_52="for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.";
N._Mak6_53="When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.";
N._Mak6_54="As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus.";
N._Mak6_55="They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.";
N._Mak6_56="And wherever he went -- into villages, towns or countryside -- they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.";
N._Mak7_1="The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and";
N._Mak7_2="saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were \"unclean,\" that is, unwashed.";
N._Mak7_3="(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.";
N._Mak7_4="When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles. )";
N._Mak7_5="So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, \"Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with 'unclean' hands?\"";
N._Mak7_6="He replied, \"Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: \" 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.";
N._Mak7_7="They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.'";
N._Mak7_8="You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men.\"";
N._Mak7_9="And he said to them: \"You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!";

N._Mak7_11="But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God),";
N._Mak7_12="then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.";
N._Mak7_13="Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.\"";
N._Mak7_14="Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, \"Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.";
N._Mak7_15="Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.' \"";
N._Mak7_16="[mismatch#4.]";
N._Mak7_17="After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.";
N._Mak7_18="\"Are you so dull?\" he asked. \"Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'?";
N._Mak7_19="For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.\" (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods \"clean.\")";
N._Mak7_20="He went on: \"What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.'";
N._Mak7_21="For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,";
N._Mak7_22="greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.";
N._Mak7_23="All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.' \"";
N._Mak7_24="Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.";
N._Mak7_25="In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet.";
N._Mak7_26="The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.";
N._Mak7_27="\"First let the children eat all they want,\" he told her, \"for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.\"";
N._Mak7_28="\"Yes, Lord,\" she replied, \"but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.\"";
N._Mak7_29="Then he told her, \"For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.\"";
N._Mak7_30="She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.";
N._Mak7_31="Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.";
N._Mak7_32="There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man.";
N._Mak7_33="After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue.";
N._Mak7_34="He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, \"Ephphatha!\" (which means, \"Be opened!\" ).";
N._Mak7_35="At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.";
N._Mak7_36="Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.";
N._Mak7_37="People were overwhelmed with amazement. \"He has done everything well,\" they said. \"He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.\"";
N._Mak8_1="During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said,";
N._Mak8_2="\"I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.";
N._Mak8_3="If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, because some of them have come a long distance.\"";
N._Mak8_4="His disciples answered, \"But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?\"";
N._Mak8_5="\"How many loaves do you have?\" Jesus asked. \"Seven,\" they replied.";
N._Mak8_6="He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people, and they did so.";
N._Mak8_7="They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them.";
N._Mak8_8="The people ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.";
N._Mak8_9="About four thousand men were present. And having sent them away,";
N._Mak8_10="he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.";
N._Mak8_11="The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for a sign from heaven.";
N._Mak8_12="He sighed deeply and said, \"Why does this generation ask for a miraculous sign? I tell you the truth, no sign will be given to it.\"";
N._Mak8_13="Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.";
N._Mak8_14="The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.";
N._Mak8_15="\"Be careful,\" Jesus warned them. \"Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod.\"";
N._Mak8_16="They discussed this with one another and said, \"It is because we have no bread.\"";
N._Mak8_17="Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: \"Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?";

N._Mak8_19="When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?\" \"Twelve,\" they replied.";

N._Mak8_21="He said to them, \"Do you still not understand?\"";
N._Mak8_22="They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him.";
N._Mak8_23="He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, \"Do you see anything?\"";
N._Mak8_24="He looked up and said, \"I see people; they look like trees walking around.\"";
N._Mak8_25="Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.";
N._Mak8_26="Jesus sent him home, saying, \"Don't go into the village. \"";
N._Mak8_27="Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, \"Who do people say I am?\"";
