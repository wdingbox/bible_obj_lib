N._Jos22_12="the whole assembly of Israel gathered at Shiloh to go to war against them.";
N._Jos22_13="So the Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, to the land of Gileadto Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh.";
N._Jos22_14="With him they sent ten of the chief men, one for each of the tribes of Israel, each the head of a family division among the Israelite clans.";
N._Jos22_15="When they went to Gilead - to Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh - they said to them:";
