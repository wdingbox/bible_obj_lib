N._Heb12_10="Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness.";

N._Heb12_24="to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.";
N._Heb12_25="See to it that you do not refuse him who speaks. If they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, how much less will we, if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven?";
N._Heb12_26="At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, \"Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.\"";
N._Heb12_27="The words \"once more\" indicate the removing of what can be shaken -- that is, created things -- so that what cannot be shaken may remain.";

N._Heb13_11="The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp.";

N._Heb13_16="And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.";
N._Heb13_17="Obey your leaders and submit to their authority. They keep watch over you as men who must give an account. Obey them so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no advantage to you.";

N._Jas1_5="If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him.";

N._Jas1_13="When tempted, no one should say, \"God is tempting me.\" For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone;";
N._Jas1_14="but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed.";

N._Jas1_26="If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless.";
N._Jas1_27="Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.";
N._Jas2_1="My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism.";
N._Jas2_2="Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in.";

N._Jas2_5="Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?";
N._Jas2_6="But you have insulted the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?";
N._Jas2_7="Are they not the ones who are slandering the noble name of him to whom you belong?";
N._Jas2_8="If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, \"Love your neighbor as yourself,\" you are doing right.";
N._Jas2_9="But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.";
N._Jas2_10="For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.";

N._Jas2_12="Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom,";

N._Jas2_15="Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.";
N._Jas2_16="If one of you says to him, \"Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,\" but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it?";
N._Jas2_17="In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.";
N._Jas2_18="But someone will say, \"You have faith; I have deeds.\"";
N._Jas2_19="Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do. You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that-- and shudder.";
N._Jas2_20="You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless ?";
N._Jas2_21="Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?";

N._Jas3_3="When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal.";
N._Jas3_4="Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go.";
N._Jas3_5="Likewise the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.";
N._Jas3_6="The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.";
N._Jas3_7="All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man,";
N._Jas3_8="but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.";

N._Jas3_18="Peacemakers who sow in peace raise a harvest of righteousness.";
N._Jas4_1="What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you?";
N._Jas4_2="You want something but don't get it. You kill and covet, but you cannot have what you want. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask God.";
N._Jas4_3="When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.";
N._Jas4_4="You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.";
N._Jas4_5="Or do you think Scripture says without reason that the spirit he caused to live in us envies intensely?";

N._Jas4_10="Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.";
N._Jas4_11="Brothers, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against his brother or judges him speaks against the law and judges it. When you judge the law, you are not keeping it, but sitting in judgment on it.";
N._Jas4_12="There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy. But you -- who are you to judge your neighbor?";
N._Jas4_13="Now listen, you who say, \"Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.\"";
N._Jas4_14="Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.";
N._Jas4_15="Instead, you ought to say, \"If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that.\"";
N._Jas4_16="As it is, you boast and brag. All such boasting is evil.";

N._Jas5_5="You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.";
N._Jas5_6="You have condemned and murdered innocent men, who were not opposing you.";

N._Jas5_10="Brothers, as an example of patience in the face of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.";
N._Jas5_11="As you know, we consider blessed those who have persevered. You have heard of Job's perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.";
N._Jas5_12="Above all, my brothers, do not swear-- not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. Let your \"Yes\" be yes, and your \"No,\" no, or you will be condemned.";
N._Jas5_13="Is any one of you in trouble? He should pray. Is anyone happy? Let him sing songs of praise.";
N._Jas5_14="Is any one of you sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord.";
N._Jas5_15="And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him up. If he has sinned, he will be forgiven.";
N._Jas5_16="Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.";
N._Jas5_17="Elijah was a man just like us. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years.";
N._Jas5_18="Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.";
