N._Jug19_12="His master replied, \"No. We won't go into an alien city, whose people are not Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah.\"";
N._Jug19_13="He added, \"Come, let's try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places.\"";
N._Jug19_14="So they went on, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin.";
N._Jug19_15="There they stopped to spend the night. They went and sat in the city square, but no one took them into his home for the night.";
N._Jug19_16="That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim, who was living in Gibeah (the men of the place were Benjamites), came in from his work in the fields.";
N._Jug19_17="When he looked and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, \"Where are you going? Where did you come from?\"";
N._Jug19_18="He answered, \"We are on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim where I live. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going to the house of the LORD . No one has taken me into his house.";
N._Jug19_19="We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servants-me, your maidservant, and the young man with us. We don't need anything.\"";
N._Jug19_20="\"You are welcome at my house,\" the old man said. \"Let me supply whatever you need. Only don't spend the night in the square.\"";
N._Jug19_21="So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they had something to eat and drink.";
N._Jug19_22="While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, \"Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him.\"";
N._Jug19_23="The owner of the house went outside and said to them, \"No, my friends, don't be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don't do this disgraceful thing.";
N._Jug19_24="Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But to this man, don't do such a disgraceful thing.\"";
N._Jug19_25="But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go.";
N._Jug19_26="At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight.";
N._Jug19_27="When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold.";
N._Jug19_28="He said to her, \"Get up; let's go.\" But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home.";
N._Jug19_29="When he reached home, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel.";
N._Jug19_30="Everyone who saw it said, \"Such a thing has never been seen or done, not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt. Think about it! Consider it! Tell us what to do!\"";
N._Jug20_1="Then all the Israelites from Dan to Beersheba and from the land of Gilead came out as one man and assembled before the LORD in Mizpah.";
N._Jug20_2="The leaders of all the people of the tribes of Israel took their places in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand soldiers armed with swords.";
N._Jug20_3="(The Benjamites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.) Then the Israelites said, \"Tell us how this awful thing happened.\"";
N._Jug20_4="So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, said, \"I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night.";
N._Jug20_5="During the night the men of Gibeah came after me and surrounded the house, intending to kill me. They raped my concubine, and she died.";
N._Jug20_6="I took my concubine, cut her into pieces and sent one piece to each region of Israel's inheritance, because they committed this lewd and disgraceful act in Israel.";
N._Jug20_7="Now, all you Israelites, speak up and give your verdict.\"";
N._Jug20_8="All the people rose as one man, saying, \"None of us will go home. No, not one of us will return to his house.";
N._Jug20_9="But now this is what we'll do to Gibeah: We'll go up against it as the lot directs.";
N._Jug20_10="We'll take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred from a thousand, and a thousand from ten thousand, to get provisions for the army. Then, when the army arrives at Gibeah in Benjamin, it can give them what they deserve for all this vileness done in Israel.\"";
N._Jug20_11="So all the men of Israel got together and united as one man against the city.";
N._Jug20_12="The tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, \"What about this awful crime that was committed among you?";
N._Jug20_13="Now surrender those wicked men of Gibeah so that we may put them to death and purge the evil from Israel.\" But the Benjamites would not listen to their fellow Israelites.";
N._Jug20_14="From their towns they came together at Gibeah to fight against the Israelites.";
N._Jug20_15="At once the Benjamites mobilized twenty-six thousand swordsmen from their towns, in addition to seven hundred chosen men from those living in Gibeah.";
N._Jug20_16="Among all these soldiers there were seven hundred chosen men who were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.";
N._Jug20_17="Israel, apart from Benjamin, mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen, all of them fighting men.";
N._Jug20_18="The Israelites went up to Bethel and inquired of God. They said, \"Who of us shall go first to fight against the Benjamites?\" The LORD replied, \"Judah shall go first.\"";
N._Jug20_19="The next morning the Israelites got up and pitched camp near Gibeah.";
N._Jug20_20="The men of Israel went out to fight the Benjamites and took up battle positions against them at Gibeah.";
N._Jug20_21="The Benjamites came out of Gibeah and cut down twenty-two thousand Israelites on the battlefield that day.";
N._Jug20_22="But the men of Israel encouraged one another and again took up their positions where they had stationed themselves the first day.";
N._Jug20_23="The Israelites went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and they inquired of the LORD . They said, \"Shall we go up again to battle against the Benjamites, our brothers?\" The LORD answered, \"Go up against them.\"";
N._Jug20_24="Then the Israelites drew near to Benjamin the second day.";
N._Jug20_25="This time, when the Benjamites came out from Gibeah to oppose them, they cut down another eighteen thousand Israelites, all of them armed with swords.";
N._Jug20_26="Then the Israelites, all the people, went up to Bethel, and there they sat weeping before the LORD . They fasted that day until evening and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the LORD .";
N._Jug20_27="And the Israelites inquired of the LORD . (In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there,";
N._Jug20_28="with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, ministering before it.) They asked, \"Shall we go up again to battle with Benjamin our brother, or not?\" The LORD responded, \"Go, for tomorrow I will give them into your hands.\"";
N._Jug20_29="Then Israel set an ambush around Gibeah.";
N._Jug20_30="They went up against the Benjamites on the third day and took up positions against Gibeah as they had done before.";
N._Jug20_31="The Benjamites came out to meet them and were drawn away from the city. They began to inflict casualties on the Israelites as before, so that about thirty men fell in the open field and on the roads - the one leading to Bethel and the other to Gibeah.";
N._Jug20_32="While the Benjamites were saying, \"We are defeating them as before,\" the Israelites were saying, \"Let's retreat and draw them away from the city to the roads.\"";
N._Jug20_33="All the men of Israel moved from their places and took up positions at Baal Tamar, and the Israelite ambush charged out of its place on the west of Gibeah.";
N._Jug20_34="Then ten thousand of Israel's finest men made a frontal attack on Gibeah. The fighting was so heavy that the Benjamites did not realize how near disaster was.";
N._Jug20_35="The LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords.";
N._Jug20_36="Then the Benjamites saw that they were beaten. Now the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah.";
N._Jug20_37="The men who had been in ambush made a sudden dash into Gibeah, spread out and put the whole city to the sword.";
N._Jug20_38="The men of Israel had arranged with the ambush that they should send up a great cloud of smoke from the city,";
N._Jug20_39="and then the men of Israel would turn in the battle. The Benjamites had begun to inflict casualties on the men of Israel (about thirty), and they said, \"We are defeating them as in the first battle.\"";
N._Jug20_40="But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city, the Benjamites turned and saw the smoke of the whole city going up into the sky.";
N._Jug20_41="Then the men of Israel turned on them, and the men of Benjamin were terrified, because they realized that disaster had come upon them.";
N._Jug20_42="So they fled before the Israelites in the direction of the desert, but they could not escape the battle. And the men of Israel who came out of the towns cut them down there.";
N._Jug20_43="They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them and easily overran them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.";
N._Jug20_44="Eighteen thousand Benjamites fell, all of them valiant fighters.";
N._Jug20_45="As they turned and fled toward the desert to the rock of Rimmon, the Israelites cut down five thousand men along the roads. They kept pressing after the Benjamites as far as Gidom and struck down two thousand more.";
N._Jug20_46="On that day twenty-five thousand Benjamite swordsmen fell, all of them valiant fighters.";
N._Jug20_47="But six hundred men turned and fled into the desert to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed four months.";
N._Jug20_48="The men of Israel went back to Benjamin and put all the towns to the sword, including the animals and everything else they found. All the towns they came across they set on fire.";
N._Jug21_1="The men of Israel had taken an oath at Mizpah: \"Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite.\"";
N._Jug21_2="The people went to Bethel, where they sat before God until evening, raising their voices and weeping bitterly.";
N._Jug21_3="\"O LORD , the God of Israel,\" they cried, \"why has this happened to Israel? Why should one tribe be missing from Israel today?\"";
N._Jug21_4="Early the next day the people built an altar and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.";
N._Jug21_5="Then the Israelites asked, \"Who from all the tribes of Israel has failed to assemble before the LORD ?\" For they had taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to assemble before the LORD at Mizpah should certainly be put to death.";
N._Jug21_6="Now the Israelites grieved for their brothers, the Benjamites. \"Today one tribe is cut off from Israel,\" they said.";
N._Jug21_7="\"How can we provide wives for those who are left, since we have taken an oath by the LORD not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?\"";
N._Jug21_8="Then they asked, \"Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to assemble before the LORD at Mizpah?\" They discovered that no one from Jabesh Gilead had come to the camp for the assembly.";
N._Jug21_9="For when they counted the people, they found that none of the people of Jabesh Gilead were there.";
N._Jug21_10="So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there, including the women and children.";
N._Jug21_11="\"This is what you are to do,\" they said. \"Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin.\"";
N._Jug21_12="They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man, and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.";
N._Jug21_13="Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon.";
N._Jug21_14="So the Benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared. But there were not enough for all of them.";
N._Jug21_15="The people grieved for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a gap in the tribes of Israel.";
N._Jug21_16="And the elders of the assembly said, \"With the women of Benjamin destroyed, how shall we provide wives for the men who are left?";
N._Jug21_17="The Benjamite survivors must have heirs,\" they said, \"so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out.";
N._Jug21_18="We can't give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have taken this oath: 'Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.'";
N._Jug21_19="But look, there is the annual festival of the LORD in Shiloh, to the north of Bethel, and east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and to the south of Lebonah.\"";
N._Jug21_20="So they instructed the Benjamites, saying, \"Go and hide in the vineyards";
N._Jug21_21="and watch. When the girls of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing, then rush from the vineyards and each of you seize a wife from the girls of Shiloh and go to the land of Benjamin.";
N._Jug21_22="When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, 'Do us a kindness by helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war, and you are innocent, since you did not give your daughters to them.' \"";
N._Jug21_23="So that is what the Benjamites did. While the girls were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them.";
N._Jug21_24="At that time the Israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans, each to his own inheritance.";
N._Jug21_25="In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit.";
N._Rut1_1="In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab.";
N._Rut1_2="The man's name was Elimelech, his wife's name Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there.";
N._Rut1_3="Now Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons.";
N._Rut1_4="They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years,";
N._Rut1_5="both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.";
N._Rut1_6="When she heard in Moab that the Lord had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, Naomi and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there.";
N._Rut1_7="With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah.";
N._Rut1_8="Then Naomi said to her two daughtersin- law, \"Go back, each of you, to your mother's home. May the Lord show kindness to you, as you have shown to your dead and to me.";
N._Rut1_9="May the Lord grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband.\" Then she kissed them and they wept aloud";
N._Rut1_10="and said to her, \"We will go back with you to your people.\"";
N._Rut1_11="But Naomi said, \"Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands?";
N._Rut1_12="Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me-even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons-";
N._Rut1_13="would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the Lord 's hand has gone out against me!\"";
N._Rut1_14="At this they wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but Ruth clung to her.";
N._Rut1_15="\"Look,\" said Naomi, \"your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.\"";
N._Rut1_16="But Ruth replied, \"Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God.";
N._Rut1_17="Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me.\"";
N._Rut1_18="When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.";
N._Rut1_19="So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, \"Can this be Naomi?\"";
N._Rut1_20="\"Don't call me Naomi, \" she told them. \"Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter.";
N._Rut1_21="I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The Lord has afflicted me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me.\"";
N._Rut1_22="So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.";
N._Rut2_1="Now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side, from the clan of Elimelech, a man of standing, whose name was Boaz.";
N._Rut2_2="And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, \"Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor.\" Naomi said to her, \"Go ahead, my daughter.\"";
N._Rut2_3="So she went out and began to glean in the fields behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech.";
N._Rut2_4="Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, \"The Lord be with you!\" \"The Lord bless you!\" they called back.";
N._Rut2_5="Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, \"Whose young woman is that?\"";
N._Rut2_6="The foreman replied, \"She is the Moabitess who came back from Moab with Naomi.";
N._Rut2_7="She said, 'Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.' She went into the field and has worked steadily from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter.\"";
N._Rut2_8="So Boaz said to Ruth, \"My daughter, listen to me. Don't go and glean in another field and don't go away from here. Stay here with my servant girls.";
N._Rut2_9="Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the girls. I have told the men not to touch you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled.\"";
N._Rut2_10="At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She exclaimed, \"Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me - a foreigner?\"";
N._Rut2_11="Boaz replied, \"I've been told all about what you have done for your mother-inlaw since the death of your husbandhow you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before.";
N._Rut2_12="May the Lord repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the Lord , the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.\"";
N._Rut2_13="\"May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord,\" she said. \"You have given me comfort and have spoken kindly to your servant-though I do not have the standing of one of your servant girls.\"";
N._Rut2_14="At mealtime Boaz said to her, \"Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar.\" When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over.";
N._Rut2_15="As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, \"Even if she gathers among the sheaves, don't embarrass her.";
N._Rut2_16="Rather, pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don't rebuke her.\"";
N._Rut2_17="So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah.";
N._Rut2_18="She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough.";
N._Rut2_19="Her mother-in-law asked her, \"Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!\" Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. \"The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,\" she said.";
N._Rut2_20="\"The Lord bless him!\" Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. \"He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead.\" She added, \"That man is our close relative; he is one of our kinsman-redeemers.\"";
N._Rut2_21="Then Ruth the Moabitess said, \"He even said to me, 'Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.' \"";
N._Rut2_22="Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-inlaw, \"It will be good for you, my daughter, to go with his girls, because in someone else's field you might be harmed.\"";
N._Rut2_23="So Ruth stayed close to the servant girls of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.";
N._Rut3_1="One day Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, \"My daughter, should I not try to find a home for you, where you will be well provided for?";
N._Rut3_2="Is not Boaz, with whose servant girls you have been, a kinsman of ours? Tonight he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor.";
N._Rut3_3="Wash and perfume yourself, and put on your best clothes. Then go down to the threshing floor, but don't let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.";
N._Rut3_4="When he lies down, note the place where he is lying. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what to do.\"";
N._Rut3_5="\"I will do whatever you say,\" Ruth answered.";
N._Rut3_6="So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to do.";
N._Rut3_7="When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile. Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet and lay down.";
N._Rut3_8="In the middle of the night something startled the man, and he turned and discovered a woman lying at his feet.";
N._Rut3_9="\"Who are you?\" he asked. \"I am your servant Ruth,\" she said. \"Spread the corner of your garment over me, since you are a kinsman-redeemer.\"";
N._Rut3_10="\"The Lord bless you, my daughter,\" he replied. \"This kindness is greater than that which you showed earlier: You have not run after the younger men, whether rich or poor.";
N._Rut3_11="And now, my daughter, don't be afraid. I will do for you all you ask. All my fellow townsmen know that you are a woman of noble character.";
N._Rut3_12="Although it is true that I am near of kin, there is a kinsman-redeemer nearer than I.";
N._Rut3_13="Stay here for the night, and in the morning if he wants to redeem, good; let him redeem. But if he is not willing, as surely as the Lord lives I will do it. Lie here until morning.\"";
N._Rut3_14="So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before anyone could be recognized; and he said, \"Don't let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.\"";
N._Rut3_15="He also said, \"Bring me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out.\" When she did so, he poured into it six measures of barley and put it on her. Then he went back to town.";
N._Rut3_16="When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, \"How did it go, my daughter?\" Then she told her everything Boaz had done for her";
N._Rut3_17="and added, \"He gave me these six measures of barley, saying, 'Don't go back to your mother-in-law emptyhanded.' \"";
N._Rut3_18="Then Naomi said, \"Wait, my daughter, until you find out what happens. For the man will not rest until the matter is settled today.\"";
N._Rut4_1="Meanwhile Boaz went up to the town gate and sat there. When the kinsmanredeemer he had mentioned came along, Boaz said, \"Come over here, my friend, and sit down.\" So he went over and sat down.";
N._Rut4_2="Boaz took ten of the elders of the town and said, \"Sit here,\" and they did so.";
N._Rut4_3="Then he said to the kinsman-redeemer, \"Naomi, who has come back from Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.";
N._Rut4_4="I thought I should bring the matter to your attention and suggest that you buy it in the presence of these seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, do so. But if you will not, tell me, so I will know. For no one has the right to do it except you, and I am next in line.\" \"I will redeem it,\" he said.";
N._Rut4_5="Then Boaz said, \"On the day you buy the land from Naomi and from Ruth the Moabitess, you acquire the dead man's widow, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property.\"";
N._Rut4_6="At this, the kinsman-redeemer said, \"Then I cannot redeem it because I might endanger my own estate. You redeem it yourself. I cannot do it.\"";
N._Rut4_7="(Now in earlier times in Israel, for the redemption and transfer of property to become final, one party took off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the method of legalizing transactions in Israel.)";
N._Rut4_8="So the kinsman-redeemer said to Boaz, \"Buy it yourself.\" And he removed his sandal.";
N._Rut4_9="Then Boaz announced to the elders and all the people, \"Today you are witnesses that I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelech, Kilion and Mahlon.";
N._Rut4_10="I have also acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon's widow, as my wife, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property, so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from the town records. Today you are witnesses!\"";
N._Rut4_11="Then the elders and all those at the gate said, \"We are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you have standing in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.";
N._Rut4_12="Through the offspring the Lord gives you by this young woman, may your family be like that of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.\"";
N._Rut4_13="So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. Then he went to her, and the Lord enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.";
N._Rut4_14="The women said to Naomi: \"Praise be to the Lord , who this day has not left you without a kinsman-redeemer. May he become famous throughout Israel!";
N._Rut4_15="He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-inlaw, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth.\"";
N._Rut4_16="Then Naomi took the child, laid him in her lap and cared for him.";
N._Rut4_17="The women living there said, \"Naomi has a son.\" And they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.";
