N._Jug6_3="Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country.";
N._Jug6_4="They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel, neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys.";
N._Jug6_5="They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts. It was impossible to count the men and their camels; they invaded the land to ravage it.";
N._Jug6_6="Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to the LORD for help.";
N._Jug6_7="When the Israelites cried to the LORD because of Midian,";
N._Jug6_8="he sent them a prophet, who said, \"This is what the LORD , the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.";
N._Jug6_9="I snatched you from the power of Egypt and from the hand of all your oppressors. I drove them from before you and gave you their land.";
N._Jug6_10="I said to you, 'I am the LORD your God; do not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.' But you have not listened to me.\"";
N._Jug6_11="The angel of the LORD came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites.";
N._Jug6_12="When the angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon, he said, \"The LORD is with you, mighty warrior.\"";
N._Jug6_13="\"But sir,\" Gideon replied, \"if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our fathers told us about when they said, 'Did not the LORD bring us up out of Egypt?' But now the LORD has abandoned us and put us into the hand of Midian.\"";
N._Jug6_14="The LORD turned to him and said, \"Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?\"";
N._Jug6_15="\"But Lord , \" Gideon asked, \"how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.\"";

N._Jug6_19="Gideon went in, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak.";
N._Jug6_20="The angel of God said to him, \"Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.\" And Gideon did so.";
N._Jug6_21="With the tip of the staff that was in his hand, the angel of the LORD touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the LORD disappeared.";
N._Jug6_22="When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the LORD , he exclaimed, \"Ah, Sovereign LORD ! I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!\"";
N._Jug6_23="But the LORD said to him, \"Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.\"";
N._Jug6_24="So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it The LORD is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.";
N._Jug6_25="That same night the LORD said to him, \"Take the second bull from your father's herd, the one seven years old. Tear down your father's altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.";
N._Jug6_26="Then build a proper kind of altar to the LORD your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second bull as a burnt offering.\"";
N._Jug6_27="So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the men of the town, he did it at night rather than in the daytime.";

N._Jug6_32="So that day they called Gideon \"Jerub- Baal, \" saying, \"Let Baal contend with him,\" because he broke down Baal's altar.";
N._Jug6_33="Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.";
N._Jug6_34="Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him.";
N._Jug6_35="He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them.";
N._Jug6_36="Gideon said to God, \"If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised-";

N._Jug6_38="And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew - a bowlful of water.";
N._Jug6_39="Then Gideon said to God, \"Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece. This time make the fleece dry and the ground covered with dew.\"";

N._Jug7_4="But the LORD said to Gideon, \"There are still too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will sift them for you there. If I say, 'This one shall go with you,' he shall go; but if I say, 'This one shall not go with you,' he shall not go.\"";
N._Jug7_5="So Gideon took the men down to the water. There the LORD told him, \"Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink.\"";
N._Jug7_6="Three hundred men lapped with their hands to their mouths. All the rest got down on their knees to drink.";
N._Jug7_7="The LORD said to Gideon, \"With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands. Let all the other men go, each to his own place.\"";
N._Jug7_8="So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites to their tents but kept the three hundred, who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others. Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley.";
N._Jug7_9="During that night the LORD said to Gideon, \"Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands.";
N._Jug7_10="If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah";

N._Jug7_12="The Midianites, the Amalekites and all the other eastern peoples had settled in the valley, thick as locusts. Their camels could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore.";
N._Jug7_13="Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. \"I had a dream,\" he was saying. \"A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed.\"";
N._Jug7_14="His friend responded, \"This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands.\"";

N._Jug7_19="Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands.";

N._Jug7_22="When the three hundred trumpets sounded, the LORD caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other with their swords. The army fled to Beth Shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.";
N._Jug7_23="Israelites from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh were called out, and they pursued the Midianites.";
N._Jug7_24="Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, saying, \"Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth Barah.\" So all the men of Ephraim were called out and they took the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth Barah.";
N._Jug7_25="They also captured two of the Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was by the Jordan.";
N._Jug8_1="Now the Ephraimites asked Gideon, \"Why have you treated us like this? Why didn't you call us when you went to fight Midian?\" And they criticized him sharply.";
N._Jug8_2="But he answered them, \"What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren't the gleanings of Ephraim's grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer?";

N._Jug8_4="Gideon and his three hundred men, exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit, came to the Jordan and crossed it.";
N._Jug8_5="He said to the men of Succoth, \"Give my troops some bread; they are worn out, and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.\"";

N._Jug8_16="He took the elders of the town and taught the men of Succoth a lesson by punishing them with desert thorns and briers.";
