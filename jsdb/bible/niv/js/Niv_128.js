N._Rom6_5="If we have been united with him like this in his death, we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection.";
N._Rom6_6="For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin--";
N._Rom6_7="because anyone who has died has been freed from sin.";

N._Rom6_15="What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!";

N._Rom6_18="You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.";
N._Rom6_19="I put this in human terms because you are weak in your natural selves. Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to everincreasing wickedness, so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness.";
N._Rom6_20="When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness.";
N._Rom6_21="What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death!";
N._Rom6_22="But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.";
N._Rom6_23="For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.";
N._Rom7_1="Do you not know, brothers -- for I am speaking to men who know the law -- that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?";
N._Rom7_2="For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage.";
N._Rom7_3="So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man.";
N._Rom7_4="So, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God.";

N._Rom7_7="What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, \"Do not covet.\"";

N._Rom7_9="Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.";
N._Rom7_10="I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.";
N._Rom7_11="For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.";
N._Rom7_12="So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.";
N._Rom7_13="Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.";
N._Rom7_14="We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.";
N._Rom7_15="I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.";
N._Rom7_16="And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.";
N._Rom7_17="As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.";
N._Rom7_18="I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.";
N._Rom7_19="For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do -- this I keep on doing.";
N._Rom7_20="Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.";
N._Rom7_21="So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me.";

N._Rom7_24="What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?";
N._Rom7_25="Thanks be to God -- through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.";
N._Rom8_1="Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,";
N._Rom8_2="because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death.";
N._Rom8_3="For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in sinful man,";
N._Rom8_4="in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit.";
N._Rom8_5="Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.";
