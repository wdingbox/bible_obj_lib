N._2Ki6_15="When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. \"Oh, my lord, what shall we do?\" the servant asked.";
N._2Ki6_16="\"Don't be afraid,\" the prophet answered. \"Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.\"";
N._2Ki6_17="And Elisha prayed, \"O Lord , open his eyes so he may see.\" Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.";
N._2Ki6_18="As the enemy came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the Lord , \"Strike these people with blindness.\" So he struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked.";
N._2Ki6_19="Elisha told them, \"This is not the road and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are looking for.\" And he led them to Samaria.";
N._2Ki6_20="After they entered the city, Elisha said, \"Lord , open the eyes of these men so they can see.\" Then the Lord opened their eyes and they looked, and there they were, inside Samaria.";
N._2Ki6_21="When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, \"Shall I kill them, my father? Shall I kill them?\"";
N._2Ki6_22="\"Do not kill them,\" he answered. \"Would you kill men you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink and then go back to their master.\"";
N._2Ki6_23="So he prepared a great feast for them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away, and they returned to their master. So the bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel's territory.";

N._2Ki6_27="The king replied, \"If the Lord does not help you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor? From the winepress?\"";
