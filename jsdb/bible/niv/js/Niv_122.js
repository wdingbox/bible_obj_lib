N._Jhn11_57="But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.";
N._Jhn12_1="Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.";
N._Jhn12_2="Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.";
N._Jhn12_3="Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.";
N._Jhn12_4="But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected,";
N._Jhn12_5="\"Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages. \"";
N._Jhn12_6="He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.";

N._Jhn12_8="You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.\"";
N._Jhn12_9="Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.";
N._Jhn12_10="So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well,";
N._Jhn12_11="for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him.";
N._Jhn12_12="The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem.";

N._Jhn12_16="At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.";
N._Jhn12_17="Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word.";
N._Jhn12_18="Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him.";
N._Jhn12_19="So the Pharisees said to one another, \"See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!\"";
N._Jhn12_20="Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast.";
N._Jhn12_21="They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. \"Sir,\" they said, \"we would like to see Jesus.\"";

N._Jhn12_40="\"He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn-- and I would heal them.\"";
N._Jhn12_41="Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him.";
N._Jhn12_42="Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue;";
N._Jhn12_43="for they loved praise from men more than praise from God.";
N._Jhn12_44="Then Jesus cried out, \"When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me.";
N._Jhn12_45="When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me.";
N._Jhn12_46="I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.";

N._Jhn13_1="It was just before the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love.";
N._Jhn13_2="The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus.";
N._Jhn13_3="Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God;";
N._Jhn13_4="so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.";
N._Jhn13_5="After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.";
N._Jhn13_6="He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, \"Lord, are you going to wash my feet?\"";

N._Jhn13_27="As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.";
N._Jhn13_28="\"What you are about to do, do quickly,\" Jesus told him, but no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him.";

N._Jhn18_6="\"I am he,\" Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.) When Jesus said, \"I am he,\" they drew back and fell to the ground.";
N._Jhn18_7="Again he asked them, \"Who is it you want?\" And they said, \"Jesus of Nazareth.\"";
N._Jhn18_8="\"I told you that I am he,\" Jesus answered. \"If you are looking for me, then let these men go.\"";
N._Jhn18_9="This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: \"I have not lost one of those you gave me.\"";
N._Jhn18_10="Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.)";
N._Jhn18_11="Jesus commanded Peter, \"Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?\"";
N._Jhn18_12="Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him";
N._Jhn18_13="and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.";
N._Jhn18_14="Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people.";
N._Jhn18_15="Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard,";
N._Jhn18_16="but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the girl on duty there and brought Peter in.";
N._Jhn18_17="\"You are not one of his disciples, are you?\" the girl at the door asked Peter. He replied, \"I am not.\"";
N._Jhn18_18="It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.";
N._Jhn18_19="Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.";
N._Jhn18_20="\"I have spoken openly to the world,\" Jesus replied. \"I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.";
N._Jhn18_21="Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said.\"";
N._Jhn18_22="When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby struck him in the face. \"Is this the way you answer the high priest?\" he demanded.";
N._Jhn18_23="\"If I said something wrong,\" Jesus replied, \"testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?\"";
N._Jhn18_24="Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest.";
N._Jhn18_25="As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, \"You are not one of his disciples, are you?\" He denied it, saying, \"I am not.\"";
N._Jhn18_26="One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, \"Didn't I see you with him in the olive grove?\"";
N._Jhn18_27="Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow.";
N._Jhn18_28="Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.";
