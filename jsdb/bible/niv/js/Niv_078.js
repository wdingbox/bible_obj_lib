N._Ecc7_12="Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this: that wisdom preserves the life of its possessor.";
N._Ecc7_13="Consider what God has done: Who can straighten what he has made crooked?";
N._Ecc7_14="When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider: God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore, a man cannot discover anything about his future.";
N._Ecc7_15="In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these: a righteous man perishing in his righteousness, and a wicked man living long in his wickedness.";
N._Ecc7_16="Do not be overrighteous, neither be overwise- why destroy yourself?";
N._Ecc7_17="Do not be overwicked, and do not be a fool- why die before your time?";

N._Ecc7_24="Whatever wisdom may be, it is far off and most profound- who can discover it?";
N._Ecc7_25="So I turned my mind to understand, to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the madness of folly.";
N._Ecc7_26="I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner she will ensnare.";
N._Ecc7_27="\"Look,\" says the Teacher, \"this is what I have discovered: \"Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things-";
N._Ecc7_28="while I was still searching but not finding- I found one upright man among a thousand, but not one upright woman among them all.";
N._Ecc7_29="This only have I found: God made mankind upright, but men have gone in search of many schemes.\"";

N._Ecc8_3="Do not be in a hurry to leave the king's presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases.";

N._Ecc8_7="Since no man knows the future, who can tell him what is to come?";
N._Ecc8_8="No man has power over the wind to contain it ; so no one has power over the day of his death. As no one is discharged in time of war, so wickedness will not release those who practice it.";
N._Ecc8_9="All this I saw, as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own hurt.";
N._Ecc8_10="Then too, I saw the wicked buriedthose who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise in the city where they did this. This too is meaningless.";
N._Ecc8_11="When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, the hearts of the people are filled with schemes to do wrong.";
N._Ecc8_12="Although a wicked man commits a hundred crimes and still lives a long time, I know that it will go better with God-fearing men, who are reverent before God.";
N._Ecc8_13="Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.";
N._Ecc8_14="There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: righteous men who get what the wicked deserve, and wicked men who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless.";
N._Ecc8_15="So I commend the enjoyment of life, because nothing is better for a man under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany him in his work all the days of the life God has given him under the sun.";
N._Ecc8_16="When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe man's labor on earth - his eyes not seeing sleep day or night-";
N._Ecc8_17="then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all his efforts to search it out, man cannot discover its meaning. Even if a wise man claims he knows, he cannot really comprehend it.";
N._Ecc9_1="So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God's hands, but no man knows whether love or hate awaits him.";
N._Ecc9_2="All share a common destiny - the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. As it is with the good man, so with the sinner; as it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid to take them.";
N._Ecc9_3="This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of men, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead.";
N._Ecc9_4="Anyone who is among the living has hope -even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!";
N._Ecc9_5="For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward, and even the memory of them is forgotten.";
N._Ecc9_6="Their love, their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished; never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun.";

N._Ecc9_8="Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil.";
N._Ecc9_9="Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun- all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun.";
N._Ecc9_10="Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.";
N._Ecc9_11="I have seen something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all.";
N._Ecc9_12="Moreover, no man knows when his hour will come: As fish are caught in a cruel net, or birds are taken in a snare, so men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them.";
N._Ecc9_13="I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me:";
N._Ecc9_14="There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siegeworks against it.";
N._Ecc9_15="Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man.";
N._Ecc9_16="So I said, \"Wisdom is better than strength.\" But the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded.";
N._Ecc9_17="The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools.";
N._Ecc9_18="Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.";
