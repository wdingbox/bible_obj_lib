N._Jos3_16="the water from upstream stopped flowing. It piled up in a heap a great distance away, at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan, while the water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea ) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.";

N._Jos4_4="So Joshua called together the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe,";

N._Jos4_7="tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord . When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel forever.\"";
N._Jos4_8="So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, as the Lord had told Joshua; and they carried them over with them to their camp, where they put them down.";
N._Jos4_9="Joshua set up the twelve stones that had been in the middle of the Jordan at the spot where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood. And they are there to this day.";
N._Jos4_10="Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the Lord had commanded Joshua was done by the people, just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried over,";

N._Jos4_16="\"Command the priests carrying the ark of the Testimony to come up out of the Jordan.\"";
N._Jos4_17="So Joshua commanded the priests, \"Come up out of the Jordan.\"";

N._Jos4_19="On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.";

N._Jos4_22="tell them, 'Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.'";
N._Jos4_23="For the Lord your God dried up the Jordan before you until you had crossed over. The Lord your God did to the Jordan just what he had done to the Red Sea when he dried it up before us until we had crossed over.";
N._Jos4_24="He did this so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the Lord is powerful and so that you might always fear the Lord your God.\"";
N._Jos5_1="Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast heard how the Lord had dried up the Jordan before the Israelites until we had crossed over, their hearts melted and they no longer had the courage to face the Israelites.";
N._Jos5_2="At that time the Lord said to Joshua, \"Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites again.\"";
N._Jos5_3="So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth.";
N._Jos5_4="Now this is why he did so: All those who came out of Egypt - all the men of military age - died in the desert on the way after leaving Egypt.";
N._Jos5_5="All the people that came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the desert during the journey from Egypt had not.";
N._Jos5_6="The Israelites had moved about in the desert forty years until all the men who were of military age when they left Egypt had died, since they had not obeyed the Lord .

N._Jos5_7="So he raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way.";
N._Jos5_8="And after the whole nation had been circumcised, they remained where they were in camp until they were healed.";
N._Jos5_9="Then the Lord said to Joshua, \"Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.\" So the place has been called Gilgal to this day.";
N._Jos5_10="On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, the Israelites celebrated the Passover.";
N._Jos5_11="The day after the Passover, that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land: unleavened bread and roasted grain.";
N._Jos5_12="The manna stopped the day after they ate this food from the land; there was no longer any manna for the Israelites, but that year they ate of the produce of Canaan.";
N._Jos5_13="Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, \"Are you for us or for our enemies?\"";
N._Jos5_14="\"Neither,\" he replied, \"but as commander of the army of the Lord I have now come.\" Then Joshua fell facedown to the ground in reverence, and asked him, \"What message does my Lord have for his servant?\"";
N._Jos5_15="The commander of the Lord 's army replied, \"Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy.\" And Joshua did so.";
N._Jos6_1="Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in.";

N._Jos6_5="When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have all the people give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the people will go up, every man straight in.\"";
N._Jos6_6="So Joshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them, \"Take up the ark of the covenant of the Lord and have seven priests carry trumpets in front of it.\"";

N._Jos6_8="When Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets before the Lord went forward, blowing their trumpets, and the ark of the Lord 's covenant followed them.";
N._Jos6_9="The armed guard marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed the ark. All this time the trumpets were sounding.";
N._Jos6_10="But Joshua had commanded the people, \"Do not give a war cry, do not raise your voices, do not say a word until the day I tell you to shout. Then shout!\"";
N._Jos6_11="So he had the ark of the Lord carried around the city, circling it once. Then the people returned to camp and spent the night there.";
N._Jos6_12="Joshua got up early the next morning and the priests took up the ark of the Lord .";

N._Jos6_16="The seventh time around, when the priests sounded the trumpet blast, Joshua commanded the people, \"Shout! For the Lord has given you the city!";

N._Jos6_20="When the trumpets sounded, the people shouted, and at the sound of the trumpet, when the people gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so every man charged straight in, and they took the city.";
N._Jos6_21="They devoted the city to the Lord and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it - men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys.";
N._Jos6_22="Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, \"Go into the prostitute's house and bring her out and all who belong to her, in accordance with your oath to her.\"";

N._Jos6_24="Then they burned the whole city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the Lord 's house.";
N._Jos6_25="But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho - and she lives among the Israelites to this day.";

N._Jos7_1="But the Israelites acted unfaithfully in regard to the devoted things ; Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of them. So the Lord 's anger burned against Israel.";
