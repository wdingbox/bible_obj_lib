Genesis
1In the beginning God created the
heavens and the earth.
2Now the earth was formless and empty,
darkness was over the surface of the
deep, and the Spirit of God was
hovering over the waters.
3And God said, "Let there be light," and
there was light.
4God saw that the light was good, and
he separated the light from the darkness.
5God called the light "day," and the
darkness he called "night." And there
was evening, and there was morningthe
first day.
6And God said, "Let there be an
expanse between the waters to
separate water from water."
7So God made the expanse and
separated the water under the expanse
from the water above it. And it was so.
8God called the expanse "sky." And
there was evening, and there was
morning-the second day.
9And God said, "Let the water under the
sky be gathered to one place, and let
dry ground appear." And it was so.
10God called the dry ground "land," and
the gathered waters he called "seas."
And God saw that it was good.
11Then God said, "Let the land produce
vegetation: seed-bearing plants and
trees on the land that bear fruit with
seed in it, according to their various
kinds." And it was so.
12The land produced vegetation: plants
bearing seed according to their kinds
and trees bearing fruit with seed in it
according to their kinds. And God saw
that it was good.
13And there was evening, and there was
morning-the third day.
14And God said, "Let there be lights in
the expanse of the sky to separate the
day from the night, and let them serve
as signs to mark seasons and days and
years,
15and let them be lights in the expanse
of the sky to give light on the earth." And
it was so.
16God made two great lights-the greater
light to govern the day and the lesser
light to govern the night. He also made
the stars.
17God set them in the expanse of the
sky to give light on the earth,
18to govern the day and the night, and to
separate light from darkness. And God
saw that it was good.
19And there was evening, and there was
morning-the fourth day.
20And God said, "Let the water teem
with living creatures, and let birds fly
above the earth across the expanse of
the sky."
21So God created the great creatures of
the sea and every living and moving
thing with which the water teems,
according to their kinds, and every
winged bird according to its kind. And
God saw that it was good.
22God blessed them and said, "Be
fruitful and increase in number and fill
the water in the seas, and let the birds
increase on the earth."
23And there was evening, and there was
morning-the fifth day.
24And God said, "Let the land produce
living creatures according to their kinds:
livestock, creatures that move along the
ground, and wild animals, each
according to its kind." And it was so.
25God made the wild animals according
to their kinds, the livestock according to
their kinds, and all the creatures that
move along the ground according to
their kinds. And God saw that it was
good.
26Then God said, "Let us make man in
our image, in our likeness, and let them
rule over the fish of the sea and the
birds of the air, over the livestock, over
all the earth, and over all the creatures
that move along the ground."
27So God created man in his own image,
in the image of God he created him;
male and female he created them.
28God blessed them and said to them,
"Be fruitful and increase in number; fill
the earth and subdue it. Rule over the
fish of the sea and the birds of the air
and over every living creature that
moves on the ground."
29Then God said, "I give you every seedbearing
plant on the face of the whole
earth and every tree that has fruit with
seed in it. They will be yours for food.
30And to all the beasts of the earth and
all the birds of the air and all the
creatures that move on the groundeverything
that has the breath of life in
it-I give every green plant for food." And
it was so.
31God saw all that he had made, and it
was very good. And there was evening,
and there was morning-the sixth day.
2Thus the heavens and the earth were
completed in all their vast array.
2By the seventh day God had finished
the work he had been doing; so on the
seventh day he rested from all his work.
3And God blessed the seventh day and
made it holy, because on it he rested
from all the work of creating that he had
done.
4This is the account of the heavens and
the earth when they were created.
When the Lord God made the earth and
the heavens-
5and no shrub of the field had yet
appeared on the earth and no plant of
the field had yet sprung up, for the Lord
God had not sent rain on the earth and
there was no man to work the ground,
6but streams came up from the earth
and watered the whole surface of the
ground-
7the Lord God formed the man from the
dust of the ground and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life, and the man
became a living being.
8Now the Lord God had planted a
garden in the east, in Eden; and there
he put the man he had formed.
9And the Lord God made all kinds of
trees grow out of the ground-trees that
were pleasing to the eye and good for
food. In the middle of the garden were
the tree of life and the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil.
10A river watering the garden flowed
from Eden; from there it was separated
into four headwaters.
11The name of the first is the Pishon; it
winds through the entire land of Havilah,
where there is gold.
12(The gold of that land is good;
aromatic resin and onyx are also there.)
13The name of the second river is the
Gihon; it winds through the entire land of
Cush.
14The name of the third river is the
Tigris; it runs along the east side of
Asshur. And the fourth river is the
Euphrates.
15The Lord God took the man and put
him in the Garden of Eden to work it and
take care of it.
16And the Lord God commanded the
man, "You are free to eat from any tree
in the garden;
17but you must not eat from the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil, for
when you eat of it you will surely die."
18The Lord God said, "It is not good for
the man to be alone. I will make a helper
suitable for him."
19Now the Lord God had formed out of
the ground all the beasts of the field and
all the birds of the air. He brought them
to the man to see what he would name
them; and whatever the man called
each living creature, that was its name.
20So the man gave names to all the
livestock, the birds of the air and all the
beasts of the field. But for Adam no
suitable helper was found.
21So the Lord God caused the man to
fall into a deep sleep; and while he was
sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs
and closed up the place with flesh.
22Then the Lord God made a woman
from the rib he had taken out of the man,
and he brought her to the man.
23The man said, "This is now bone of my
bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall
be called 'woman, ' for she was taken
out of man."
24For this reason a man will leave his
father and mother and be united to his
wife, and they will become one flesh.
25The man and his wife were both naked,
and they felt no shame.
3Now the serpent was more crafty
than any of the wild animals the Lord
God had made. He said to the woman,
"Did God really say, 'You must not eat
from any tree in the garden'?"
2The woman said to the serpent, "We
may eat fruit from the trees in the
garden,
3but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit
from the tree that is in the middle of the
garden, and you must not touch it, or
you will die.' "
4"You will not surely die," the serpent
said to the woman.
5"For God knows that when you eat of it
your eyes will be opened, and you will
be like God, knowing good and evil."
6When the woman saw that the fruit of
the tree was good for food and pleasing
to the eye, and also desirable for
gaining wisdom, she took some and ate
it. She also gave some to her husband,
who was with her, and he ate it.
7Then the eyes of both of them were
opened, and they realized they were
naked; so they sewed fig leaves
together and made coverings for
themselves.
8Then the man and his wife heard the
sound of the Lord God as he was
walking in the garden in the cool of the
day, and they hid from the Lord God
among the trees of the garden.
9But the Lord God called to the man,
"Where are you?"
10He answered, "I heard you in the
garden, and I was afraid because I was
naked; so I hid."
11And he said, "Who told you that you
were naked? Have you eaten from the
tree that I commanded you not to eat
from?"
12The man said, "The woman you put
here with me-she gave me some fruit
from the tree, and I ate it."
13Then the Lord God said to the woman,
"What is this you have done?" The
woman said, "The serpent deceived me,
and I ate."
14So the Lord God said to the serpent,
"Because you have done this, "Cursed
are you above all the livestock and all
the wild animals! You will crawl on your
belly and you will eat dust all the days of
your life.
15And I will put enmity between you and
the woman, and between your offspring
and hers; he will crush your head, and
you will strike his heel."
16To the woman he said, "I will greatly
increase your pains in childbearing; with
pain you will give birth to children. Your
desire will be for your husband, and he
will rule over you."
17To Adam he said, "Because you
listened to your wife and ate from the
tree about which I commanded you,
'You must not eat of it,' "Cursed is the
ground because of you; through painful
toil you will eat of it all the days of your
life.
18It will produce thorns and thistles for
you, and you will eat the plants of the
field.
19By the sweat of your brow you will eat
your food until you return to the ground,
since from it you were taken; for dust
you are and to dust you will return."
20Adam named his wife Eve, because
she would become the mother of all the
living.
21The Lord God made garments of skin
for Adam and his wife and clothed them.
22And the Lord God said, "The man has
now become like one of us, knowing
good and evil. He must not be allowed
to reach out his hand and take also from
the tree of life and eat, and live forever."
23So the Lord God banished him from
the Garden of Eden to work the ground
from which he had been taken.
24After he drove the man out, he placed
on the east side of the Garden of Eden
cherubim and a flaming sword flashing
back and forth to guard the way to the
tree of life.
4Adam lay with his wife Eve, and she
became pregnant and gave birth to Cain.
She said, "With the help of the Lord I
have brought forth a man."
2Later she gave birth to his brother Abel.
Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked
the soil.
3In the course of time Cain brought
some of the fruits of the soil as an
offering to the Lord .
4But Abel brought fat portions from
some of the firstborn of his flock. The
Lord looked with favor on Abel and his
offering,
5but on Cain and his offering he did not
look with favor. So Cain was very angry,
and his face was downcast.
6Then the Lord said to Cain, "Why are
you angry? Why is your face downcast?
7If you do what is right, will you not be
accepted? But if you do not do what is
right, sin is crouching at your door; it
desires to have you, but you must
master it."
8Now Cain said to his brother Abel,
"Let's go out to the field." And while they
were in the field, Cain attacked his
brother Abel and killed him.
9Then the Lord said to Cain, "Where is
your brother Abel?" "I don't know," he
replied. "Am I my brother's keeper?"
10The Lord said, "What have you done?
Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to
me from the ground.
11Now you are under a curse and driven
from the ground, which opened its
mouth to receive your brother's blood
from your hand.
12When you work the ground, it will no
longer yield its crops for you. You will be
a restless wanderer on the earth."
13Cain said to the Lord , "My punishment
is more than I can bear.
14Today you are driving me from the
land, and I will be hidden from your
presence; I will be a restless wanderer
on the earth, and whoever finds me will
kill me."
15But the Lord said to him, "Not so ; if
anyone kills Cain, he will suffer
vengeance seven times over." Then the
Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one
who found him would kill him.
16So Cain went out from the Lord 's
presence and lived in the land of Nod,
east of Eden.
17Cain lay with his wife, and she became
pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain
was then building a city, and he named
it after his son Enoch.
18To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was
the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael
was the father of Methushael, and
Methushael was the father of Lamech.
19Lamech married two women, one
named Adah and the other Zillah.
20Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the
father of those who live in tents and
raise livestock.
21His brother's name was Jubal; he was
the father of all who play the harp and
flute.
22Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who
forged all kinds of tools out of bronze
and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was
Naamah.
23Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and
Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech,
hear my words. I have killed a man for
wounding me, a young man for injuring
me.
24If Cain is avenged seven times, then
Lamech seventy-seven times."
25Adam lay with his wife again, and she
gave birth to a son and named him Seth,
saying, "God has granted me another
child in place of Abel, since Cain killed
him."
26Seth also had a son, and he named
him Enosh. At that time men began to
call on the name of the Lord .
5This is the written account of Adam's
line. When God created man, he made
him in the likeness of God.
2He created them male and female and
blessed them. And when they were
created, he called them "man. "
3When Adam had lived 130 years, he
had a son in his own likeness, in his
own image; and he named him Seth.
4After Seth was born, Adam lived 800
years and had other sons and daughters.
5Altogether, Adam lived 930 years, and
then he died.
6When Seth had lived 105 years, he
became the father of Enosh.
7And after he became the father of
Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had
other sons and daughters.
8Altogether, Seth lived 912 years, and
then he died.
9When Enosh had lived 90 years, he
became the father of Kenan.
10And after he became the father of
Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and had
other sons and daughters.
11Altogether, Enosh lived 905 years, and
then he died.
12When Kenan had lived 70 years, he
became the father of Mahalalel.
13And after he became the father of
Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and
had other sons and daughters.
14Altogether, Kenan lived 910 years, and
then he died.
15When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he
became the father of Jared.
16And after he became the father of
Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and
had other sons and daughters.
17Altogether, Mahalalel lived 895 years,
and then he died.
18When Jared had lived 162 years, he
became the father of Enoch.
19And after he became the father of
Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had
other sons and daughters.
20Altogether, Jared lived 962 years, and
then he died.
21When Enoch had lived 65 years, he
became the father of Methuselah.
22And after he became the father of
Methuselah, Enoch walked with God
300 years and had other sons and
daughters.
23Altogether, Enoch lived 365 years.
24Enoch walked with God; then he was
no more, because God took him away.
25When Methuselah had lived 187 years,
he became the father of Lamech.
26And after he became the father of
Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years
and had other sons and daughters.
27Altogether, Methuselah lived 969
years, and then he died.
28When Lamech had lived 182 years, he
had a son.
29He named him Noah and said, "He will
comfort us in the labor and painful toil of
our hands caused by the ground the
Lord has cursed."
30After Noah was born, Lamech lived
595 years and had other sons and
daughters.
31Altogether, Lamech lived 777 years,
and then he died.
32After Noah was 500 years old, he
became the father of Shem, Ham and
Japheth.
6When men began to increase in
number on the earth and daughters
were born to them,
2the sons of God saw that the daughters
of men were beautiful, and they married
any of them they chose.
3Then the Lord said, "My Spirit will not
contend with man forever, for he is
mortal ; his days will be a hundred and
twenty years."
4The Nephilim were on the earth in
those days-and also afterward-when the
sons of God went to the daughters of
men and had children by them. They
were the heroes of old, men of renown.
5The Lord saw how great man's
wickedness on the earth had become,
and that every inclination of the thoughts
of his heart was only evil all the time.
6The Lord was grieved that he had
made man on the earth, and his heart
was filled with pain.
7So the Lord said, "I will wipe mankind,
whom I have created, from the face of
the earth-men and animals, and
creatures that move along the ground,
and birds of the air-for I am grieved that
I have made them."
8But Noah found favor in the eyes of the
Lord .
9This is the account of Noah. Noah was
a righteous man, blameless among the
people of his time, and he walked with
God.
10Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and
Japheth.
11Now the earth was corrupt in God's
sight and was full of violence.
12God saw how corrupt the earth had
become, for all the people on earth had
corrupted their ways.
13So God said to Noah, "I am going to
put an end to all people, for the earth is
filled with violence because of them. I
am surely going to destroy both them
and the earth.
14So make yourself an ark of cypress
wood; make rooms in it and coat it with
pitch inside and out.
15This is how you are to build it: The ark
is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and
45 feet high.
16Make a roof for it and finish the ark to
within 18 inches of the top. Put a door in
the side of the ark and make lower,
middle and upper decks.
17I am going to bring floodwaters on the
earth to destroy all life under the
heavens, every creature that has the
breath of life in it. Everything on earth
will perish.
18But I will establish my covenant with
you, and you will enter the ark-you and
your sons and your wife and your sons'
wives with you.
19You are to bring into the ark two of all
living creatures, male and female, to
keep them alive with you.
20Two of every kind of bird, of every kind
of animal and of every kind of creature
that moves along the ground will come
to you to be kept alive.
21You are to take every kind of food that
is to be eaten and store it away as food
for you and for them."
22Noah did everything just as God
commanded him.
7The Lord then said to Noah, "Go into
the ark, you and your whole family,
because I have found you righteous in
this generation.
2Take with you seven of every kind of
clean animal, a male and its mate, and
two of every kind of unclean animal, a
male and its mate,
3and also seven of every kind of bird,
male and female, to keep their various
kinds alive throughout the earth.
4Seven days from now I will send rain on
the earth for forty days and forty nights,
and I will wipe from the face of the earth
every living creature I have made."
5And Noah did all that the Lord
commanded him.
6Noah was six hundred years old when
the floodwaters came on the earth.
7And Noah and his sons and his wife
and his sons' wives entered the ark to
escape the waters of the flood.
8Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of
birds and of all creatures that move
along the ground,
9male and female, came to Noah and
entered the ark, as God had
commanded Noah.
10And after the seven days the
floodwaters came on the earth.
11In the six hundredth year of Noah's life,
on the seventeenth day of the second
month-on that day all the springs of the
great deep burst forth, and the
floodgates of the heavens were opened.
12And rain fell on the earth forty days
and forty nights.
13On that very day Noah and his sons,
Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with
his wife and the wives of his three sons,
entered the ark.
14They had with them every wild animal
according to its kind, all livestock
according to their kinds, every creature
that moves along the ground according
to its kind and every bird according to its
kind, everything with wings.
15Pairs of all creatures that have the
breath of life in them came to Noah and
entered the ark.
16The animals going in were male and
female of every living thing, as God had
commanded Noah. Then the Lord shut
him in.
17For forty days the flood kept coming
on the earth, and as the waters
increased they lifted the ark high above
the earth.
18The waters rose and increased greatly
on the earth, and the ark floated on the
surface of the water.
19They rose greatly on the earth, and all
the high mountains under the entire
heavens were covered.
20The waters rose and covered the
mountains to a depth of more than
twenty feet. ,
21Every living thing that moved on the
earth perished-birds, livestock, wild
animals, all the creatures that swarm
over the earth, and all mankind.
22Everything on dry land that had the
breath of life in its nostrils died.
23Every living thing on the face of the
earth was wiped out; men and animals
and the creatures that move along the
ground and the birds of the air were
wiped from the earth. Only Noah was
left, and those with him in the ark.
24The waters flooded the earth for a
hundred and fifty days.
8But God remembered Noah and all
the wild animals and the livestock that
were with him in the ark, and he sent a
wind over the earth, and the waters
receded.
2Now the springs of the deep and the
floodgates of the heavens had been
closed, and the rain had stopped falling
from the sky.
3The water receded steadily from the
earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty
days the water had gone down,
4and on the seventeenth day of the
seventh month the ark came to rest on
the mountains of Ararat.
5The waters continued to recede until
the tenth month, and on the first day of
the tenth month the tops of the
mountains became visible.
6After forty days Noah opened the
window he had made in the ark
7and sent out a raven, and it kept flying
back and forth until the water had dried
up from the earth.
8Then he sent out a dove to see if the
water had receded from the surface of
the ground.
9But the dove could find no place to set
its feet because there was water over all
the surface of the earth; so it returned to
Noah in the ark. He reached out his
hand and took the dove and brought it
back to himself in the ark.
10He waited seven more days and again
sent out the dove from the ark.
11When the dove returned to him in the
evening, there in its beak was a freshly
plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that
the water had receded from the earth.
12He waited seven more days and sent
the dove out again, but this time it did
not return to him.
13By the first day of the first month of
Noah's six hundred and first year, the
water had dried up from the earth. Noah
then removed the covering from the ark
and saw that the surface of the ground
was dry.
14By the twenty-seventh day of the
second month the earth was completely
dry.
15Then God said to Noah,
16"Come out of the ark, you and your
wife and your sons and their wives.
17Bring out every kind of living creature
that is with you-the birds, the animals,
and all the creatures that move along
the ground-so they can multiply on the
earth and be fruitful and increase in
number upon it."
18So Noah came out, together with his
sons and his wife and his sons' wives.
19All the animals and all the creatures
that move along the ground and all the
birds-everything that moves on the
earth-came out of the ark, one kind after
another.
20Then Noah built an altar to the Lord
and, taking some of all the clean
animals and clean birds, he sacrificed
burnt offerings on it.
21The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma
and said in his heart: "Never again will I
curse the ground because of man, even
though every inclination of his heart is
evil from childhood. And never again will
I destroy all living creatures, as I have
done.
22"As long as the earth endures,
seedtime and harvest, cold and heat,
summer and winter, day and night will
never cease."
9Then God blessed Noah and his
sons, saying to them, "Be fruitful and
increase in number and fill the earth.
2The fear and dread of you will fall upon
all the beasts of the earth and all the
birds of the air, upon every creature that
moves along the ground, and upon all
the fish of the sea; they are given into
your hands.
3Everything that lives and moves will be
food for you. Just as I gave you the
green plants, I now give you everything.
4"But you must not eat meat that has its
lifeblood still in it.
5And for your lifeblood I will surely
demand an accounting. I will demand an
accounting from every animal. And from
each man, too, I will demand an
accounting for the life of his fellow man.
6"Whoever sheds the blood of man, by
man shall his blood be shed; for in the
image of God has God made man.
7As for you, be fruitful and increase in
number; multiply on the earth and
increase upon it."
8Then God said to Noah and to his sons
with him:
9"I now establish my covenant with you
and with your descendants after you
10and with every living creature that was
with you-the birds, the livestock and all
the wild animals, all those that came out
of the ark with you-every living creature
on earth.
11I establish my covenant with you:
Never again will all life be cut off by the
waters of a flood; never again will there
be a flood to destroy the earth."
12And God said, "This is the sign of the
covenant I am making between me and
you and every living creature with you, a
covenant for all generations to come:
13I have set my rainbow in the clouds,
and it will be the sign of the covenant
between me and the earth.
14Whenever I bring clouds over the earth
and the rainbow appears in the clouds,
15I will remember my covenant between
me and you and all living creatures of
every kind. Never again will the waters
become a flood to destroy all life.
16Whenever the rainbow appears in the
clouds, I will see it and remember the
everlasting covenant between God and
all living creatures of every kind on the
earth."
17So God said to Noah, "This is the sign
of the covenant I have established
between me and all life on the earth."
18The sons of Noah who came out of the
ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth.
(Ham was the father of Canaan.)
19These were the three sons of Noah,
and from them came the people who
were scattered over the earth.
20Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to
plant a vineyard.
21When he drank some of its wine, he
became drunk and lay uncovered inside
his tent.
22Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his
father's nakedness and told his two
brothers outside.
23But Shem and Japheth took a garment
and laid it across their shoulders; then
they walked in backward and covered
their father's nakedness. Their faces
were turned the other way so that they
would not see their father's nakedness.
24When Noah awoke from his wine and
found out what his youngest son had
done to him,
25he said, "Cursed be Canaan! The
lowest of slaves will he be to his
brothers."
26He also said, "Blessed be the Lord ,
the God of Shem! May Canaan be the
slave of Shem.
27May God extend the territory of
Japheth ; may Japheth live in the tents
of Shem, and may Canaan be his
slave."
28After the flood Noah lived 350 years.
29Altogether, Noah lived 950 years, and
then he died.
10This is the account of Shem, Ham
and Japheth, Noah's sons, who
themselves had sons after the flood.
The Japhethites
2The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog,
Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech and
Tiras.
3The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath
and Togarmah.
4The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish,
the Kittim and the Rodanim.
5(From these the maritime peoples
spread out into their territories by their
clans within their nations, each with its
own language.) The Hamites
6The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put
and Canaan.
7The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah,
Sabtah, Raamah and Sabteca. The
sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
8Cush was the father of Nimrod, who
grew to be a mighty warrior on the earth.
9He was a mighty hunter before the
Lord ; that is why it is said, "Like Nimrod,
a mighty hunter before the Lord ."
10The first centers of his kingdom were
Babylon, Erech, Akkad and Calneh, in
Shinar.
11From that land he went to Assyria,
where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir,
Calah
12and Resen, which is between Nineveh
and Calah; that is the great city.
13Mizraim was the father of the Ludites,
Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,
14Pathrusites, Casluhites (from whom
the Philistines came) and Caphtorites.
15Canaan was the father of Sidon his
firstborn, and of the Hittites,
16Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,
17Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,
18Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites.
Later the Canaanite clans scattered
19and the borders of Canaan reached
from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza,
and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah,
Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
20These are the sons of Ham by their
clans and languages, in their territories
and nations. The Semites
21Sons were also born to Shem, whose
older brother was Japheth; Shem was
the ancestor of all the sons of Eber.
22The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur,
Arphaxad, Lud and Aram.
23The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether
and Meshech.
24Arphaxad was the father of Shelah,
and Shelah the father of Eber.
25Two sons were born to Eber: One was
named Peleg, because in his time the
earth was divided; his brother was
named Joktan.
26Joktan was the father of Almodad,
Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
27Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
28Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
29Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All these
were sons of Joktan.
30The region where they lived stretched
from Mesha toward Sephar, in the
eastern hill country.
31These are the sons of Shem by their
clans and languages, in their territories
and nations.
32These are the clans of Noah's sons,
according to their lines of descent,
within their nations. From these the
nations spread out over the earth after
the flood.
11Now the whole world had one
language and a common speech.
2As men moved eastward, they found a
plain in Shinar and settled there.
3They said to each other, "Come, let's
make bricks and bake them thoroughly."
They used brick instead of stone, and
tar for mortar.
4Then they said, "Come, let us build
ourselves a city, with a tower that
reaches to the heavens, so that we may
make a name for ourselves and not be
scattered over the face of the whole
earth."
5But the Lord came down to see the city
and the tower that the men were
building.
6The Lord said, "If as one people
speaking the same language they have
begun to do this, then nothing they plan
to do will be impossible for them.
7Come, let us go down and confuse their
language so they will not understand
each other."
8So the Lord scattered them from there
over all the earth, and they stopped
building the city.
9That is why it was called Babel -
because there the Lord confused the
language of the whole world. From there
the Lord scattered them over the face of
the whole earth.
10This is the account of Shem. Two
years after the flood, when Shem was
100 years old, he became the father of
Arphaxad.
11And after he became the father of
Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and
had other sons and daughters.
12When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he
became the father of Shelah.
13And after he became the father of
Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and
had other sons and daughters.
14When Shelah had lived 30 years, he
became the father of Eber.
15And after he became the father of
Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had
other sons and daughters.
16When Eber had lived 34 years, he
became the father of Peleg.
17And after he became the father of
Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had
other sons and daughters.
18When Peleg had lived 30 years, he
became the father of Reu.
19And after he became the father of Reu,
Peleg lived 209 years and had other
sons and daughters.
20When Reu had lived 32 years, he
became the father of Serug.
21And after he became the father of
Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had
other sons and daughters.
22When Serug had lived 30 years, he
became the father of Nahor.
23And after he became the father of
Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had
other sons and daughters.
24When Nahor had lived 29 years, he
became the father of Terah.
25And after he became the father of
Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had
other sons and daughters.
26After Terah had lived 70 years, he
became the father of Abram, Nahor and
Haran.
27This is the account of Terah. Terah
became the father of Abram, Nahor and
Haran. And Haran became the father of
Lot.
28While his father Terah was still alive,
Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans, in
the land of his birth.
29Abram and Nahor both married. The
name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and
the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah;
she was the daughter of Haran, the
father of both Milcah and Iscah.
30Now Sarai was barren; she had no
children.
31Terah took his son Abram, his
grandson Lot son of Haran, and his
daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his
son Abram, and together they set out
from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to
Canaan. But when they came to Haran,
they settled there.
32Terah lived 205 years, and he died in
Haran.
12The Lord had said to Abram,
"Leave your country, your people and
your father's household and go to the
land I will show you.
2"I will make you into a great nation and
I will bless you; I will make your name
great, and you will be a blessing.
3I will bless those who bless you, and
whoever curses you I will curse; and all
peoples on earth will be blessed through
you."
4So Abram left, as the Lord had told him;
and Lot went with him. Abram was
seventy-five years old when he set out
from Haran.
5He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot,
all the possessions they had
accumulated and the people they had
acquired in Haran, and they set out for
the land of Canaan, and they arrived
there.
6Abram traveled through the land as far
as the site of the great tree of Moreh at
Shechem. At that time the Canaanites
were in the land.
7The Lord appeared to Abram and said,
"To your offspring I will give this land."
So he built an altar there to the Lord ,
who had appeared to him.
8From there he went on toward the hills
east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with
Bethel on the west and Ai on the east.
There he built an altar to the Lord and
called on the name of the Lord .
9Then Abram set out and continued
toward the Negev.
10Now there was a famine in the land,
and Abram went down to Egypt to live
there for a while because the famine
was severe.
11As he was about to enter Egypt, he
said to his wife Sarai, "I know what a
beautiful woman you are.
12When the Egyptians see you, they will
say, 'This is his wife.' Then they will kill
me but will let you live.
13Say you are my sister, so that I will be
treated well for your sake and my life will
be spared because of you."
14When Abram came to Egypt, the
Egyptians saw that she was a very
beautiful woman.
15And when Pharaoh's officials saw her,
they praised her to Pharaoh, and she
was taken into his palace.
16He treated Abram well for her sake,
and Abram acquired sheep and cattle,
male and female donkeys, menservants
and maidservants, and camels.
17But the Lord inflicted serious diseases
on Pharaoh and his household because
of Abram's wife Sarai.
18So Pharaoh summoned Abram. "What
have you done to me?" he said. "Why
didn't you tell me she was your wife?
19Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so
that I took her to be my wife? Now then,
here is your wife. Take her and go!"
20Then Pharaoh gave orders about
Abram to his men, and they sent him on
his way, with his wife and everything he
had.
13So Abram went up from Egypt to
the Negev, with his wife and everything
he had, and Lot went with him.
2Abram had become very wealthy in
livestock and in silver and gold.
3From the Negev he went from place to
place until he came to Bethel, to the
place between Bethel and Ai where his
tent had been earlier
4and where he had first built an altar.
There Abram called on the name of the
Lord .
5Now Lot, who was moving about with
Abram, also had flocks and herds and
tents.
6But the land could not support them
while they stayed together, for their
possessions were so great that they
were not able to stay together.
7And quarreling arose between Abram's
herdsmen and the herdsmen of Lot. The
Canaanites and Perizzites were also
living in the land at that time.
8So Abram said to Lot, "Let's not have
any quarreling between you and me, or
between your herdsmen and mine, for
we are brothers.
9Is not the whole land before you? Let's
part company. If you go to the left, I'll go
to the right; if you go to the right, I'll go
to the left."
10Lot looked up and saw that the whole
plain of the Jordan was well watered,
like the garden of the Lord , like the land
of Egypt, toward Zoar. (This was before
the Lord destroyed Sodom and
Gomorrah.)
11So Lot chose for himself the whole
plain of the Jordan and set out toward
the east. The two men parted company:
12Abram lived in the land of Canaan,
while Lot lived among the cities of the
plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.
13Now the men of Sodom were wicked
and were sinning greatly against the
Lord .
14The Lord said to Abram after Lot had
parted from him, "Lift up your eyes from
where you are and look north and south,
east and west.
15All the land that you see I will give to
you and your offspring forever.
16I will make your offspring like the dust
of the earth, so that if anyone could
count the dust, then your offspring could
be counted.
17Go, walk through the length and
breadth of the land, for I am giving it to
you."
18So Abram moved his tents and went to
live near the great trees of Mamre at
Hebron, where he built an altar to the
Lord .
14At this time Amraphel king of
Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar,
Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal
king of Goiim
2went to war against Bera king of
Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah,
Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king
of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is,
Zoar).
3All these latter kings joined forces in the
Valley of Siddim (the Salt Sea ).
4For twelve years they had been subject
to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth
year they rebelled.
5In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer
and the kings allied with him went out
and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth
Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites
in Shaveh Kiriathaim
6and the Horites in the hill country of
Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert.
7Then they turned back and went to En
Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they
conquered the whole territory of the
Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who
were living in Hazazon Tamar.
8Then the king of Sodom, the king of
Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king
of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is,
Zoar) marched out and drew up their
battle lines in the Valley of Siddim
9against Kedorlaomer king of Elam,
Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of
Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar-four
kings against five.
10Now the Valley of Siddim was full of
tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom
and Gomorrah fled, some of the men fell
into them and the rest fled to the hills.
11The four kings seized all the goods of
Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food;
then they went away.
12They also carried off Abram's nephew
Lot and his possessions, since he was
living in Sodom.
13One who had escaped came and
reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now
Abram was living near the great trees of
Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshcol
and Aner, all of whom were allied with
Abram.
14When Abram heard that his relative
had been taken captive, he called out
the 318 trained men born in his
household and went in pursuit as far as
Dan.
15During the night Abram divided his
men to attack them and he routed them,
pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of
Damascus.
16He recovered all the goods and
brought back his relative Lot and his
possessions, together with the women
and the other people.
17After Abram returned from defeating
Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with
him, the king of Sodom came out to
meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is,
the King's Valley).
18Then Melchizedek king of Salem
brought out bread and wine. He was
priest of God Most High,
19and he blessed Abram, saying,
"Blessed be Abram by God Most High,
Creator of heaven and earth.
20And blessed be God Most High, who
delivered your enemies into your hand."
Then Abram gave him a tenth of
everything.
21The king of Sodom said to Abram,
"Give me the people and keep the
goods for yourself."
22But Abram said to the king of Sodom,
"I have raised my hand to the Lord , God
Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,
and have taken an oath
23that I will accept nothing belonging to
you, not even a thread or the thong of a
sandal, so that you will never be able to
say, 'I made Abram rich.'
24I will accept nothing but what my men
have eaten and the share that belongs
to the men who went with me-to Aner,
Eshcol and Mamre. Let them have their
share."
15After this, the word of the Lord
came to Abram in a vision: "Do not be
afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your
very great reward. "
2But Abram said, "O Sovereign Lord ,
what can you give me since I remain
childless and the one who will inherit my
estate is Eliezer of Damascus?"
3And Abram said, "You have given me
no children; so a servant in my
household will be my heir."
4Then the word of the Lord came to him:
"This man will not be your heir, but a
son coming from your own body will be
your heir."
5He took him outside and said, "Look up
at the heavens and count the stars-if
indeed you can count them." Then he
said to him, "So shall your offspring be."
6Abram believed the Lord , and he
credited it to him as righteousness.
7He also said to him, "I am the Lord ,
who brought you out of Ur of the
Chaldeans to give you this land to take
possession of it."
8But Abram said, "O Sovereign Lord ,
how can I know that I will gain
possession of it?"
9So the Lord said to him, "Bring me a
heifer, a goat and a ram, each three
years old, along with a dove and a
young pigeon."
10Abram brought all these to him, cut
them in two and arranged the halves
opposite each other; the birds, however,
he did not cut in half.
11Then birds of prey came down on the
carcasses, but Abram drove them away.
12As the sun was setting, Abram fell into
a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful
darkness came over him.
13Then the Lord said to him, "Know for
certain that your descendants will be
strangers in a country not their own, and
they will be enslaved and mistreated
four hundred years.
14But I will punish the nation they serve
as slaves, and afterward they will come
out with great possessions.
15You, however, will go to your fathers in
peace and be buried at a good old age.
16In the fourth generation your
descendants will come back here, for
the sin of the Amorites has not yet
reached its full measure."
17When the sun had set and darkness
had fallen, a smoking firepot with a
blazing torch appeared and passed
between the pieces.
18On that day the Lord made a covenant
with Abram and said, "To your
descendants I give this land, from the
river of Egypt to the great river, the
Euphrates-
19the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites,
Kadmonites,
20Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,
21Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and
Jebusites."
16Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had
borne him no children. But she had an
Egyptian maidservant named Hagar;
2so she said to Abram, "The Lord has
kept me from having children. Go, sleep
with my maidservant; perhaps I can
build a family through her." Abram
agreed to what Sarai said.
3So after Abram had been living in
Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took
her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and
gave her to her husband to be his wife.
4He slept with Hagar, and she conceived.
When she knew she was pregnant, she
began to despise her mistress.
5Then Sarai said to Abram, "You are
responsible for the wrong I am suffering.
I put my servant in your arms, and now
that she knows she is pregnant, she
despises me. May the Lord judge
between you and me."
6"Your servant is in your hands," Abram
said. "Do with her whatever you think
best." Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so
she fled from her.
7The angel of the Lord found Hagar near
a spring in the desert; it was the spring
that is beside the road to Shur.
8And he said, "Hagar, servant of Sarai,
where have you come from, and where
are you going?" "I'm running away from
my mistress Sarai," she answered.
9Then the angel of the Lord told her, "Go
back to your mistress and submit to
her."
10The angel added, "I will so increase
your descendants that they will be too
numerous to count."
11The angel of the Lord also said to her:
"You are now with child and you will
have a son. You shall name him
Ishmael, for the Lord has heard of your
misery.
12He will be a wild donkey of a man; his
hand will be against everyone and
everyone's hand against him, and he will
live in hostility toward all his brothers."
13She gave this name to the Lord who
spoke to her: "You are the God who
sees me," for she said, "I have now
seen the One who sees me."
14That is why the well was called Beer
Lahai Roi ; it is still there, between
Kadesh and Bered.
15So Hagar bore Abram a son, and
Abram gave the name Ishmael to the
son she had borne.
16Abram was eighty-six years old when
Hagar bore him Ishmael.
17When Abram was ninety-nine
years old, the Lord appeared to him and
said, "I am God Almighty ; walk before
me and be blameless.
2I will confirm my covenant between me
and you and will greatly increase your
numbers."
3Abram fell facedown, and God said to
him,
4"As for me, this is my covenant with
you: You will be the father of many
nations.
5No longer will you be called Abram ;
your name will be Abraham, for I have
made you a father of many nations.
6I will make you very fruitful; I will make
nations of you, and kings will come from
you.
7I will establish my covenant as an
everlasting covenant between me and
you and your descendants after you for
the generations to come, to be your God
and the God of your descendants after
you.
8The whole land of Canaan, where you
are now an alien, I will give as an
everlasting possession to you and your
descendants after you; and I will be their
God."
9Then God said to Abraham, "As for you,
you must keep my covenant, you and
your descendants after you for the
generations to come.
10This is my covenant with you and your
descendants after you, the covenant
you are to keep: Every male among you
shall be circumcised.
11You are to undergo circumcision, and
it will be the sign of the covenant
between me and you.
12For the generations to come every
male among you who is eight days old
must be circumcised, including those
born in your household or bought with
money from a foreigner-those who are
not your offspring.
13Whether born in your household or
bought with your money, they must be
circumcised. My covenant in your flesh
is to be an everlasting covenant.
14Any uncircumcised male, who has not
been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut
off from his people; he has broken my
covenant."
15God also said to Abraham, "As for
Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call
her Sarai; her name will be Sarah.
16I will bless her and will surely give you
a son by her. I will bless her so that she
will be the mother of nations; kings of
peoples will come from her."
17Abraham fell facedown; he laughed
and said to himself, "Will a son be born
to a man a hundred years old? Will
Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?"
18And Abraham said to God, "If only
Ishmael might live under your blessing!"
19Then God said, "Yes, but your wife
Sarah will bear you a son, and you will
call him Isaac. I will establish my
covenant with him as an everlasting
covenant for his descendants after him.
20And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I
will surely bless him; I will make him
fruitful and will greatly increase his
numbers. He will be the father of twelve
rulers, and I will make him into a great
nation.
21But my covenant I will establish with
Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by
this time next year."
22When he had finished speaking with
Abraham, God went up from him.
23On that very day Abraham took his
son Ishmael and all those born in his
household or bought with his money,
every male in his household, and
circumcised them, as God told him.
24Abraham was ninety-nine years old
when he was circumcised,
25and his son Ishmael was thirteen;
26Abraham and his son Ishmael were
both circumcised on that same day.
27And every male in Abraham's
household, including those born in his
household or bought from a foreigner,
was circumcised with him.
18The Lord appeared to Abraham
near the great trees of Mamre while he
was sitting at the entrance to his tent in
the heat of the day.
2Abraham looked up and saw three men
standing nearby. When he saw them, he
hurried from the entrance of his tent to
meet them and bowed low to the ground.
3He said, "If I have found favor in your
eyes, my lord, do not pass your servant
by.
4Let a little water be brought, and then
you may all wash your feet and rest
under this tree.
5Let me get you something to eat, so
you can be refreshed and then go on
your way-now that you have come to
your servant." "Very well," they
answered, "do as you say."
6So Abraham hurried into the tent to
Sarah. "Quick," he said, "get three
seahs of fine flour and knead it and
bake some bread."
7Then he ran to the herd and selected a
choice, tender calf and gave it to a
servant, who hurried to prepare it.
8He then brought some curds and milk
and the calf that had been prepared,
and set these before them. While they
ate, he stood near them under a tree.
9"Where is your wife Sarah?" they asked
him. "There, in the tent," he said.
10Then the Lord said, "I will surely return
to you about this time next year, and
Sarah your wife will have a son." Now
Sarah was listening at the entrance to
the tent, which was behind him.
11Abraham and Sarah were already old
and well advanced in years, and Sarah
was past the age of childbearing.
12So Sarah laughed to herself as she
thought, "After I am worn out and my
master is old, will I now have this
pleasure?"
13Then the Lord said to Abraham, "Why
did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really
have a child, now that I am old?'
14Is anything too hard for the Lord ? I will
return to you at the appointed time next
year and Sarah will have a son."
15Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said,
"I did not laugh." But he said, "Yes, you
did laugh."
16When the men got up to leave, they
looked down toward Sodom, and
Abraham walked along with them to see
them on their way.
17Then the Lord said, "Shall I hide from
Abraham what I am about to do?
18Abraham will surely become a great
and powerful nation, and all nations on
earth will be blessed through him.
19For I have chosen him, so that he will
direct his children and his household
after him to keep the way of the Lord by
doing what is right and just, so that the
Lord will bring about for Abraham what
he has promised him."
20Then the Lord said, "The outcry
against Sodom and Gomorrah is so
great and their sin so grievous
21that I will go down and see if what they
have done is as bad as the outcry that
has reached me. If not, I will know."
22The men turned away and went
toward Sodom, but Abraham remained
standing before the Lord .
23Then Abraham approached him and
said: "Will you sweep away the
righteous with the wicked?
24What if there are fifty righteous people
in the city? Will you really sweep it away
and not spare the place for the sake of
the fifty righteous people in it?
25Far be it from you to do such a thing-to
kill the righteous with the wicked,
treating the righteous and the wicked
alike. Far be it from you! Will not the
Judge of all the earth do right?"
26The Lord said, "If I find fifty righteous
people in the city of Sodom, I will spare
the whole place for their sake."
27Then Abraham spoke up again: "Now
that I have been so bold as to speak to
the Lord, though I am nothing but dust
and ashes,
28what if the number of the righteous is
five less than fifty? Will you destroy the
whole city because of five people?" "If I
find forty-five there," he said, "I will not
destroy it."
29Once again he spoke to him, "What if
only forty are found there?" He said,
"For the sake of forty, I will not do it."
30Then he said, "May the Lord not be
angry, but let me speak. What if only
thirty can be found there?" He answered,
"I will not do it if I find thirty there."
31Abraham said, "Now that I have been
so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if
only twenty can be found there?" He
said, "For the sake of twenty, I will not
destroy it."
32Then he said, "May the Lord not be
angry, but let me speak just once more.
What if only ten can be found there?" He
answered, "For the sake of ten, I will not
destroy it."
33When the Lord had finished speaking
with Abraham, he left, and Abraham
returned home.
19The two angels arrived at Sodom
in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the
gateway of the city. When he saw them,
he got up to meet them and bowed
down with his face to the ground.
2"My lords," he said, "please turn aside
to your servant's house. You can wash
your feet and spend the night and then
go on your way early in the morning."
"No," they answered, "we will spend the
night in the square."
3But he insisted so strongly that they did
go with him and entered his house. He
prepared a meal for them, baking bread
without yeast, and they ate.
4Before they had gone to bed, all the
men from every part of the city of
Sodom-both young and old-surrounded
the house.
5They called to Lot, "Where are the men
who came to you tonight? Bring them
out to us so that we can have sex with
them."
6Lot went outside to meet them and shut
the door behind him
7and said, "No, my friends. Don't do this
wicked thing.
8Look, I have two daughters who have
never slept with a man. Let me bring
them out to you, and you can do what
you like with them. But don't do anything
to these men, for they have come under
the protection of my roof."
9"Get out of our way," they replied. And
they said, "This fellow came here as an
alien, and now he wants to play the
judge! We'll treat you worse than them."
They kept bringing pressure on Lot and
moved forward to break down the door.
10But the men inside reached out and
pulled Lot back into the house and shut
the door.
11Then they struck the men who were at
the door of the house, young and old,
with blindness so that they could not find
the door.
12The two men said to Lot, "Do you have
anyone else here-sons-in-law, sons or
daughters, or anyone else in the city
who belongs to you? Get them out of
here,
13because we are going to destroy this
place. The outcry to the Lord against its
people is so great that he has sent us to
destroy it."
14So Lot went out and spoke to his sonsin-
law, who were pledged to marry his
daughters. He said, "Hurry and get out
of this place, because the Lord is about
to destroy the city!" But his sons-in-law
thought he was joking.
15With the coming of dawn, the angels
urged Lot, saying, "Hurry! Take your
wife and your two daughters who are
here, or you will be swept away when
the city is punished."
16When he hesitated, the men grasped
his hand and the hands of his wife and
of his two daughters and led them safely
out of the city, for the Lord was merciful
to them.
17As soon as they had brought them out,
one of them said, "Flee for your lives!
Don't look back, and don't stop
anywhere in the plain! Flee to the
mountains or you will be swept away!"
18But Lot said to them, "No, my lords,
please!
19Your servant has found favor in your
eyes, and you have shown great
kindness to me in sparing my life. But I
can't flee to the mountains; this disaster
will overtake me, and I'll die.
20Look, here is a town near enough to
run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it-it
is very small, isn't it? Then my life will be
spared."
21He said to him, "Very well, I will grant
this request too; I will not overthrow the
town you speak of.
22But flee there quickly, because I
cannot do anything until you reach it."
(That is why the town was called Zoar. )
23By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun
had risen over the land.
24Then the Lord rained down burning
sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah-from
the Lord out of the heavens.
25Thus he overthrew those cities and the
entire plain, including all those living in
the cities-and also the vegetation in the
land.
26But Lot's wife looked back, and she
became a pillar of salt.
27Early the next morning Abraham got
up and returned to the place where he
had stood before the Lord .
28He looked down toward Sodom and
Gomorrah, toward all the land of the
plain, and he saw dense smoke rising
from the land, like smoke from a furnace.
29So when God destroyed the cities of
the plain, he remembered Abraham, and
he brought Lot out of the catastrophe
that overthrew the cities where Lot had
lived.
30Lot and his two daughters left Zoar
and settled in the mountains, for he was
afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two
daughters lived in a cave.
31One day the older daughter said to the
younger, "Our father is old, and there is
no man around here to lie with us, as is
the custom all over the earth.
32Let's get our father to drink wine and
then lie with him and preserve our family
line through our father."
33That night they got their father to drink
wine, and the older daughter went in
and lay with him. He was not aware of it
when she lay down or when she got up.
34The next day the older daughter said
to the younger, "Last night I lay with my
father. Let's get him to drink wine again
tonight, and you go in and lie with him
so we can preserve our family line
through our father."
35So they got their father to drink wine
that night also, and the younger
daughter went and lay with him. Again
he was not aware of it when she lay
down or when she got up.
36So both of Lot's daughters became
pregnant by their father.
37The older daughter had a son, and she
named him Moab ; he is the father of the
Moabites of today.
38The younger daughter also had a son,
and she named him Ben-Ammi ; he is
the father of the Ammonites of today.
20Now Abraham moved on from
there into the region of the Negev and
lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a
while he stayed in Gerar,
2and there Abraham said of his wife
Sarah, "She is my sister." Then
Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah
and took her.
3But God came to Abimelech in a dream
one night and said to him, "You are as
good as dead because of the woman
you have taken; she is a married
woman."
4Now Abimelech had not gone near her,
so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an
innocent nation?
5Did he not say to me, 'She is my sister,'
and didn't she also say, 'He is my
brother'? I have done this with a clear
conscience and clean hands."
6Then God said to him in the dream,
"Yes, I know you did this with a clear
conscience, and so I have kept you from
sinning against me. That is why I did not
let you touch her.
7Now return the man's wife, for he is a
prophet, and he will pray for you and
you will live. But if you do not return her,
you may be sure that you and all yours
will die."
8Early the next morning Abimelech
summoned all his officials, and when he
told them all that had happened, they
were very much afraid.
9Then Abimelech called Abraham in and
said, "What have you done to us? How
have I wronged you that you have
brought such great guilt upon me and
my kingdom? You have done things to
me that should not be done."
10And Abimelech asked Abraham, "What
was your reason for doing this?"
11Abraham replied, "I said to myself,
'There is surely no fear of God in this
place, and they will kill me because of
my wife.'
12Besides, she really is my sister, the
daughter of my father though not of my
mother; and she became my wife.
13And when God had me wander from
my father's household, I said to her,
'This is how you can show your love to
me: Everywhere we go, say of me, "He
is my brother." ' "
14Then Abimelech brought sheep and
cattle and male and female slaves and
gave them to Abraham, and he returned
Sarah his wife to him.
15And Abimelech said, "My land is
before you; live wherever you like."
16To Sarah he said, "I am giving your
brother a thousand shekels of silver.
This is to cover the offense against you
before all who are with you; you are
completely vindicated."
17Then Abraham prayed to God, and
God healed Abimelech, his wife and his
slave girls so they could have children
again,
18for the Lord had closed up every
womb in Abimelech's household
because of Abraham's wife Sarah.
21Now the Lord was gracious to
Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did
for Sarah what he had promised.
2Sarah became pregnant and bore a
son to Abraham in his old age, at the
very time God had promised him.
3Abraham gave the name Isaac to the
son Sarah bore him.
4When his son Isaac was eight days old,
Abraham circumcised him, as God
commanded him.
5Abraham was a hundred years old
when his son Isaac was born to him.
6Sarah said, "God has brought me
laughter, and everyone who hears about
this will laugh with me."
7And she added, "Who would have said
to Abraham that Sarah would nurse
children? Yet I have borne him a son in
his old age."
8The child grew and was weaned, and
on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham
held a great feast.
9But Sarah saw that the son whom
Hagar the Egyptian had borne to
Abraham was mocking,
10and she said to Abraham, "Get rid of
that slave woman and her son, for that
slave woman's son will never share in
the inheritance with my son Isaac."
11The matter distressed Abraham
greatly because it concerned his son.
12But God said to him, "Do not be so
distressed about the boy and your
maidservant. Listen to whatever Sarah
tells you, because it is through Isaac
that your offspring will be reckoned.
13I will make the son of the maidservant
into a nation also, because he is your
offspring."
14Early the next morning Abraham took
some food and a skin of water and gave
them to Hagar. He set them on her
shoulders and then sent her off with the
boy. She went on her way and
wandered in the desert of Beersheba.
15When the water in the skin was gone,
she put the boy under one of the bushes.
16Then she went off and sat down
nearby, about a bowshot away, for she
thought, "I cannot watch the boy die."
And as she sat there nearby, she began
to sob.
17God heard the boy crying, and the
angel of God called to Hagar from
heaven and said to her, "What is the
matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God
has heard the boy crying as he lies
there.
18Lift the boy up and take him by the
hand, for I will make him into a great
nation."
19Then God opened her eyes and she
saw a well of water. So she went and
filled the skin with water and gave the
boy a drink.
20God was with the boy as he grew up.
He lived in the desert and became an
archer.
21While he was living in the Desert of
Paran, his mother got a wife for him
from Egypt.
22At that time Abimelech and Phicol the
commander of his forces said to
Abraham, "God is with you in everything
you do.
23Now swear to me here before God that
you will not deal falsely with me or my
children or my descendants. Show to
me and the country where you are living
as an alien the same kindness I have
shown to you."
24Abraham said, "I swear it."
25Then Abraham complained to
Abimelech about a well of water that
Abimelech's servants had seized.
26But Abimelech said, "I don't know who
has done this. You did not tell me, and I
heard about it only today."
27So Abraham brought sheep and cattle
and gave them to Abimelech, and the
two men made a treaty.
28Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs
from the flock,
29and Abimelech asked Abraham, "What
is the meaning of these seven ewe
lambs you have set apart by
themselves?"
30He replied, "Accept these seven lambs
from my hand as a witness that I dug
this well."
31So that place was called Beersheba,
because the two men swore an oath
there.
32After the treaty had been made at
Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol the
commander of his forces returned to the
land of the Philistines.
33Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in
Beersheba, and there he called upon
the name of the Lord , the Eternal God.
34And Abraham stayed in the land of the
Philistines for a long time.
22Some time later God tested
Abraham. He said to him, "Abraham!"
"Here I am," he replied.
2Then God said, "Take your son, your
only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go
to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him
there as a burnt offering on one of the
mountains I will tell you about."
3Early the next morning Abraham got up
and saddled his donkey. He took with
him two of his servants and his son
Isaac. When he had cut enough wood
for the burnt offering, he set out for the
place God had told him about.
4On the third day Abraham looked up
and saw the place in the distance.
5He said to his servants, "Stay here with
the donkey while I and the boy go over
there. We will worship and then we will
come back to you."
6Abraham took the wood for the burnt
offering and placed it on his son Isaac,
and he himself carried the fire and the
knife. As the two of them went on
together,
7Isaac spoke up and said to his father
Abraham, "Father?" "Yes, my son?"
Abraham replied. "The fire and wood are
here," Isaac said, "but where is the lamb
for the burnt offering?"
8Abraham answered, "God himself will
provide the lamb for the burnt offering,
my son." And the two of them went on
together.
9When they reached the place God had
told him about, Abraham built an altar
there and arranged the wood on it. He
bound his son Isaac and laid him on the
altar, on top of the wood.
10Then he reached out his hand and
took the knife to slay his son.
11But the angel of the Lord called out to
him from heaven, "Abraham! Abraham!"
"Here I am," he replied.
12"Do not lay a hand on the boy," he
said. "Do not do anything to him. Now I
know that you fear God, because you
have not withheld from me your son,
your only son."
13Abraham looked up and there in a
thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns.
He went over and took the ram and
sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of
his son.
14So Abraham called that place The
Lord Will Provide. And to this day it is
said, "On the mountain of the Lord it will
be provided."
15The angel of the Lord called to
Abraham from heaven a second time
16and said, "I swear by myself, declares
the Lord , that because you have done
this and have not withheld your son,
your only son,
17I will surely bless you and make your
descendants as numerous as the stars
in the sky and as the sand on the
seashore. Your descendants will take
possession of the cities of their enemies,
18and through your offspring all nations
on earth will be blessed, because you
have obeyed me."
19Then Abraham returned to his
servants, and they set off together for
Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in
Beersheba.
20Some time later Abraham was told,
"Milcah is also a mother; she has borne
sons to your brother Nahor:
21Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother,
Kemuel (the father of Aram),
22Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and
Bethuel."
23Bethuel became the father of Rebekah.
Milcah bore these eight sons to
Abraham's brother Nahor.
24His concubine, whose name was
Reumah, also had sons: Tebah, Gaham,
Tahash and Maacah.
23Sarah lived to be a hundred and
twenty-seven years old.
2She died at Kiriath Arba (that is,
Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and
Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and
to weep over her.
3Then Abraham rose from beside his
dead wife and spoke to the Hittites. He
said,
4"I am an alien and a stranger among
you. Sell me some property for a burial
site here so I can bury my dead."
5The Hittites replied to Abraham,
6"Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty
prince among us. Bury your dead in the
choicest of our tombs. None of us will
refuse you his tomb for burying your
dead."
7Then Abraham rose and bowed down
before the people of the land, the
Hittites.
8He said to them, "If you are willing to let
me bury my dead, then listen to me and
intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on
my behalf
9so he will sell me the cave of
Machpelah, which belongs to him and is
at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it
to me for the full price as a burial site
among you."
10Ephron the Hittite was sitting among
his people and he replied to Abraham in
the hearing of all the Hittites who had
come to the gate of his city.
11"No, my lord," he said. "Listen to me; I
give you the field, and I give you the
cave that is in it. I give it to you in the
presence of my people. Bury your
dead."
12Again Abraham bowed down before
the people of the land
13and he said to Ephron in their hearing,
"Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the
price of the field. Accept it from me so I
can bury my dead there."
14Ephron answered Abraham,
15"Listen to me, my lord; the land is
worth four hundred shekels of silver, but
what is that between me and you? Bury
your dead."
16Abraham agreed to Ephron's terms
and weighed out for him the price he
had named in the hearing of the Hittites:
four hundred shekels of silver, according
to the weight current among the
merchants.
17So Ephron's field in Machpelah near
Mamre-both the field and the cave in it,
and all the trees within the borders of
the field-was deeded
18to Abraham as his property in the
presence of all the Hittites who had
come to the gate of the city.
19Afterward Abraham buried his wife
Sarah in the cave in the field of
Machpelah near Mamre (which is at
Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
20So the field and the cave in it were
deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a
burial site.
24Abraham was now old and well
advanced in years, and the Lord had
blessed him in every way.
2He said to the chief servant in his
household, the one in charge of all that
he had, "Put your hand under my thigh.
3I want you to swear by the Lord , the
God of heaven and the God of earth,
that you will not get a wife for my son
from the daughters of the Canaanites,
among whom I am living,
4but will go to my country and my own
relatives and get a wife for my son
Isaac."
5The servant asked him, "What if the
woman is unwilling to come back with
me to this land? Shall I then take your
son back to the country you came
from?"
6"Make sure that you do not take my son
back there," Abraham said.
7"The Lord , the God of heaven, who
brought me out of my father's household
and my native land and who spoke to
me and promised me on oath, saying,
'To your offspring I will give this land'-he
will send his angel before you so that
you can get a wife for my son from there.
8If the woman is unwilling to come back
with you, then you will be released from
this oath of mine. Only do not take my
son back there."
9So the servant put his hand under the
thigh of his master Abraham and swore
an oath to him concerning this matter.
10Then the servant took ten of his
master's camels and left, taking with him
all kinds of good things from his master.
He set out for Aram Naharaim and
made his way to the town of Nahor.
11He had the camels kneel down near
the well outside the town; it was toward
evening, the time the women go out to
draw water.
12Then he prayed, "O Lord , God of my
master Abraham, give me success
today, and show kindness to my master
Abraham.
13See, I am standing beside this spring,
and the daughters of the townspeople
are coming out to draw water.
14May it be that when I say to a girl,
'Please let down your jar that I may have
a drink,' and she says, 'Drink, and I'll
water your camels too'-let her be the
one you have chosen for your servant
Isaac. By this I will know that you have
shown kindness to my master."
15Before he had finished praying,
Rebekah came out with her jar on her
shoulder. She was the daughter of
Bethuel son of Milcah, who was the wife
of Abraham's brother Nahor.
16The girl was very beautiful, a virgin; no
man had ever lain with her. She went
down to the spring, filled her jar and
came up again.
17The servant hurried to meet her and
said, "Please give me a little water from
your jar."
18"Drink, my lord," she said, and quickly
lowered the jar to her hands and gave
him a drink.
19After she had given him a drink, she
said, "I'll draw water for your camels too,
until they have finished drinking."
20So she quickly emptied her jar into the
trough, ran back to the well to draw
more water, and drew enough for all his
camels.
21Without saying a word, the man
watched her closely to learn whether or
not the Lord had made his journey
successful.
22When the camels had finished drinking,
the man took out a gold nose ring
weighing a beka and two gold bracelets
weighing ten shekels.
23Then he asked, "Whose daughter are
you? Please tell me, is there room in
your father's house for us to spend the
night?"
24She answered him, "I am the daughter
of Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to
Nahor."
25And she added, "We have plenty of
straw and fodder, as well as room for
you to spend the night."
26Then the man bowed down and
worshiped the Lord ,
27saying, "Praise be to the Lord , the
God of my master Abraham, who has
not abandoned his kindness and
faithfulness to my master. As for me, the
Lord has led me on the journey to the
house of my master's relatives."
28The girl ran and told her mother's
household about these things.
29Now Rebekah had a brother named
Laban, and he hurried out to the man at
the spring.
30As soon as he had seen the nose ring,
and the bracelets on his sister's arms,
and had heard Rebekah tell what the
man said to her, he went out to the man
and found him standing by the camels
near the spring.
31"Come, you who are blessed by the
Lord ," he said. "Why are you standing
out here? I have prepared the house
and a place for the camels."
32So the man went to the house, and the
camels were unloaded. Straw and
fodder were brought for the camels, and
water for him and his men to wash their
feet.
33Then food was set before him, but he
said, "I will not eat until I have told you
what I have to say." "Then tell us,"
Laban said.
34So he said, "I am Abraham's servant.
35The Lord has blessed my master
abundantly, and he has become wealthy.
He has given him sheep and cattle,
silver and gold, menservants and
maidservants, and camels and donkeys.
36My master's wife Sarah has borne him
a son in her old age, and he has given
him everything he owns.
37And my master made me swear an
oath, and said, 'You must not get a wife
for my son from the daughters of the
Canaanites, in whose land I live,
38but go to my father's family and to my
own clan, and get a wife for my son.'
39"Then I asked my master, 'What if the
woman will not come back with me?'
40"He replied, 'The Lord , before whom I
have walked, will send his angel with
you and make your journey a success,
so that you can get a wife for my son
from my own clan and from my father's
family.
41Then, when you go to my clan, you will
be released from my oath even if they
refuse to give her to you-you will be
released from my oath.'
42"When I came to the spring today, I
said, 'O Lord , God of my master
Abraham, if you will, please grant
success to the journey on which I have
come.
43See, I am standing beside this spring;
if a maiden comes out to draw water
and I say to her, "Please let me drink a
little water from your jar,"
44and if she says to me, "Drink, and I'll
draw water for your camels too," let her
be the one the Lord has chosen for my
master's son.'
45"Before I finished praying in my heart,
Rebekah came out, with her jar on her
shoulder. She went down to the spring
and drew water, and I said to her,
'Please give me a drink.'
46"She quickly lowered her jar from her
shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I'll water
your camels too.' So I drank, and she
watered the camels also.
47"I asked her, 'Whose daughter are
you?' "She said, 'The daughter of
Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah
bore to him.' "Then I put the ring in her
nose and the bracelets on her arms,
48and I bowed down and worshiped the
Lord . I praised the Lord , the God of my
master Abraham, who had led me on
the right road to get the granddaughter
of my master's brother for his son.
49Now if you will show kindness and
faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if
not, tell me, so I may know which way to
turn."
50Laban and Bethuel answered, "This is
from the Lord ; we can say nothing to
you one way or the other.
51Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and
let her become the wife of your master's
son, as the Lord has directed."
52When Abraham's servant heard what
they said, he bowed down to the ground
before the Lord .
53Then the servant brought out gold and
silver jewelry and articles of clothing and
gave them to Rebekah; he also gave
costly gifts to her brother and to her
mother.
54Then he and the men who were with
him ate and drank and spent the night
there. When they got up the next
morning, he said, "Send me on my way
to my master."
55But her brother and her mother replied,
"Let the girl remain with us ten days or
so; then you may go."
56But he said to them, "Do not detain me,
now that the Lord has granted success
to my journey. Send me on my way so I
may go to my master."
57Then they said, "Let's call the girl and
ask her about it."
58So they called Rebekah and asked her,
"Will you go with this man?" "I will go,"
she said.
59So they sent their sister Rebekah on
her way, along with her nurse and
Abraham's servant and his men.
60And they blessed Rebekah and said to
her, "Our sister, may you increase to
thousands upon thousands; may your
offspring possess the gates of their
enemies."
61Then Rebekah and her maids got
ready and mounted their camels and
went back with the man. So the servant
took Rebekah and left.
62Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai
Roi, for he was living in the Negev.
63He went out to the field one evening to
meditate, and as he looked up, he saw
camels approaching.
64Rebekah also looked up and saw
Isaac. She got down from her camel
65and asked the servant, "Who is that
man in the field coming to meet us?"
"He is my master," the servant
answered. So she took her veil and
covered herself.
66Then the servant told Isaac all he had
done.
67Isaac brought her into the tent of his
mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah.
So she became his wife, and he loved
her; and Isaac was comforted after his
mother's death.
25Abraham took another wife,
whose name was Keturah.
2She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan,
Midian, Ishbak and Shuah.
3Jokshan was the father of Sheba and
Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were
the Asshurites, the Letushites and the
Leummites.
4The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher,
Hanoch, Abida and Eldaah. All these
were descendants of Keturah.
5Abraham left everything he owned to
Isaac.
6But while he was still living, he gave
gifts to the sons of his concubines and
sent them away from his son Isaac to
the land of the east.
7Altogether, Abraham lived a hundred
and seventy-five years.
8Then Abraham breathed his last and
died at a good old age, an old man and
full of years; and he was gathered to his
people.
9His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him
in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre,
in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the
Hittite,
10the field Abraham had bought from the
Hittites. There Abraham was buried with
his wife Sarah.
11After Abraham's death, God blessed
his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer
Lahai Roi.
12This is the account of Abraham's son
Ishmael, whom Sarah's maidservant,
Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham.
13These are the names of the sons of
Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth:
Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar,
Adbeel, Mibsam,
14Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
15Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and
Kedemah.
16These were the sons of Ishmael, and
these are the names of the twelve tribal
rulers according to their settlements and
camps.
17Altogether, Ishmael lived a hundred
and thirty-seven years. He breathed his
last and died, and he was gathered to
his people.
18His descendants settled in the area
from Havilah to Shur, near the border of
Egypt, as you go toward Asshur. And
they lived in hostility toward all their
brothers.
19This is the account of Abraham's son
Isaac. Abraham became the father of
Isaac,
20and Isaac was forty years old when he
married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel
the Aramean from Paddan Aram and
sister of Laban the Aramean.
21Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of
his wife, because she was barren. The
Lord answered his prayer, and his wife
Rebekah became pregnant.
22The babies jostled each other within
her, and she said, "Why is this
happening to me?" So she went to
inquire of the Lord .
23The Lord said to her, "Two nations are
in your womb, and two peoples from
within you will be separated; one people
will be stronger than the other, and the
older will serve the younger."
24When the time came for her to give
birth, there were twin boys in her womb.
25The first to come out was red, and his
whole body was like a hairy garment; so
they named him Esau.
26After this, his brother came out, with
his hand grasping Esau's heel; so he
was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty
years old when Rebekah gave birth to
them.
27The boys grew up, and Esau became
a skillful hunter, a man of the open
country, while Jacob was a quiet man,
staying among the tents.
28Isaac, who had a taste for wild game,
loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
29Once when Jacob was cooking some
stew, Esau came in from the open
country, famished.
30He said to Jacob, "Quick, let me have
some of that red stew! I'm famished!"
(That is why he was also called Edom. )
31Jacob replied, "First sell me your
birthright."
32"Look, I am about to die," Esau said.
"What good is the birthright to me?"
33But Jacob said, "Swear to me first." So
he swore an oath to him, selling his
birthright to Jacob.
34Then Jacob gave Esau some bread
and some lentil stew. He ate and drank,
and then got up and left. So Esau
despised his birthright.
26Now there was a famine in the
land-besides the earlier famine of
Abraham's time-and Isaac went to
Abimelech king of the Philistines in
Gerar.
2The Lord appeared to Isaac and said,
"Do not go down to Egypt; live in the
land where I tell you to live.
3Stay in this land for a while, and I will
be with you and will bless you. For to
you and your descendants I will give all
these lands and will confirm the oath I
swore to your father Abraham.
4I will make your descendants as
numerous as the stars in the sky and
will give them all these lands, and
through your offspring all nations on
earth will be blessed,
5because Abraham obeyed me and kept
my requirements, my commands, my
decrees and my laws."
6So Isaac stayed in Gerar.
7When the men of that place asked him
about his wife, he said, "She is my
sister," because he was afraid to say,
"She is my wife." He thought, "The men
of this place might kill me on account of
Rebekah, because she is beautiful."
8When Isaac had been there a long time,
Abimelech king of the Philistines looked
down from a window and saw Isaac
caressing his wife Rebekah.
9So Abimelech summoned Isaac and
said, "She is really your wife! Why did
you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac
answered him, "Because I thought I
might lose my life on account of her."
10Then Abimelech said, "What is this
you have done to us? One of the men
might well have slept with your wife, and
you would have brought guilt upon us."
11So Abimelech gave orders to all the
people: "Anyone who molests this man
or his wife shall surely be put to death."
12Isaac planted crops in that land and
the same year reaped a hundredfold,
because the Lord blessed him.
13The man became rich, and his wealth
continued to grow until he became very
wealthy.
14He had so many flocks and herds and
servants that the Philistines envied him.
15So all the wells that his father's
servants had dug in the time of his
father Abraham, the Philistines stopped
up, filling them with earth.
16Then Abimelech said to Isaac, "Move
away from us; you have become too
powerful for us."
17So Isaac moved away from there and
encamped in the Valley of Gerar and
settled there.
18Isaac reopened the wells that had
been dug in the time of his father
Abraham, which the Philistines had
stopped up after Abraham died, and he
gave them the same names his father
had given them.
19Isaac's servants dug in the valley and
discovered a well of fresh water there.
20But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled
with Isaac's herdsmen and said, "The
water is ours!" So he named the well
Esek, because they disputed with him.
21Then they dug another well, but they
quarreled over that one also; so he
named it Sitnah.
22He moved on from there and dug
another well, and no one quarreled over
it. He named it Rehoboth, saying, "Now
the Lord has given us room and we will
flourish in the land."
23From there he went up to Beersheba.
24That night the Lord appeared to him
and said, "I am the God of your father
Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with
you; I will bless you and will increase the
number of your descendants for the
sake of my servant Abraham."
25Isaac built an altar there and called on
the name of the Lord . There he pitched
his tent, and there his servants dug a
well.
26Meanwhile, Abimelech had come to
him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his
personal adviser and Phicol the
commander of his forces.
27Isaac asked them, "Why have you
come to me, since you were hostile to
me and sent me away?"
28They answered, "We saw clearly that
the Lord was with you; so we said,
'There ought to be a sworn agreement
between us'-between us and you. Let us
make a treaty with you
29that you will do us no harm, just as we
did not molest you but always treated
you well and sent you away in peace.
And now you are blessed by the Lord ."
30Isaac then made a feast for them, and
they ate and drank.
31Early the next morning the men swore
an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent
them on their way, and they left him in
peace.
32That day Isaac's servants came and
told him about the well they had dug.
They said, "We've found water!"
33He called it Shibah, and to this day the
name of the town has been Beersheba.
34When Esau was forty years old, he
married Judith daughter of Beeri the
Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of
Elon the Hittite.
35They were a source of grief to Isaac
and Rebekah.
27When Isaac was old and his eyes
were so weak that he could no longer
see, he called for Esau his older son
and said to him, "My son." "Here I am,"
he answered.
2Isaac said, "I am now an old man and
don't know the day of my death.
3Now then, get your weapons-your
quiver and bow-and go out to the open
country to hunt some wild game for me.
4Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like
and bring it to me to eat, so that I may
give you my blessing before I die."
5Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac
spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left
for the open country to hunt game and
bring it back,
6Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "Look,
I overheard your father say to your
brother Esau,
7'Bring me some game and prepare me
some tasty food to eat, so that I may
give you my blessing in the presence of
the Lord before I die.'
8Now, my son, listen carefully and do
what I tell you:
9Go out to the flock and bring me two
choice young goats, so I can prepare
some tasty food for your father, just the
way he likes it.
10Then take it to your father to eat, so
that he may give you his blessing before
he dies."
11Jacob said to Rebekah his mother,
"But my brother Esau is a hairy man,
and I'm a man with smooth skin.
12What if my father touches me? I would
appear to be tricking him and would
bring down a curse on myself rather
than a blessing."
13His mother said to him, "My son, let
the curse fall on me. Just do what I say;
go and get them for me."
14So he went and got them and brought
them to his mother, and she prepared
some tasty food, just the way his father
liked it.
15Then Rebekah took the best clothes of
Esau her older son, which she had in
the house, and put them on her younger
son Jacob.
16She also covered his hands and the
smooth part of his neck with the
goatskins.
17Then she handed to her son Jacob the
tasty food and the bread she had made.
18He went to his father and said, "My
father." "Yes, my son," he answered.
"Who is it?"
19Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau
your firstborn. I have done as you told
me. Please sit up and eat some of my
game so that you may give me your
blessing."
20Isaac asked his son, "How did you find
it so quickly, my son?" "The Lord your
God gave me success," he replied.
21Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Come near
so I can touch you, my son, to know
whether you really are my son Esau or
not."
22Jacob went close to his father Isaac,
who touched him and said, "The voice is
the voice of Jacob, but the hands are
the hands of Esau."
23He did not recognize him, for his
hands were hairy like those of his
brother Esau; so he blessed him.
24"Are you really my son Esau?" he
asked. "I am," he replied.
25Then he said, "My son, bring me some
of your game to eat, so that I may give
you my blessing." Jacob brought it to
him and he ate; and he brought some
wine and he drank.
26Then his father Isaac said to him,
"Come here, my son, and kiss me."
27So he went to him and kissed him.
When Isaac caught the smell of his
clothes, he blessed him and said, "Ah,
the smell of my son is like the smell of a
field that the Lord has blessed.
28May God give you of heaven's dew
and of earth's richness- an abundance
of grain and new wine.
29May nations serve you and peoples
bow down to you. Be lord over your
brothers, and may the sons of your
mother bow down to you. May those
who curse you be cursed and those who
bless you be blessed."
30After Isaac finished blessing him and
Jacob had scarcely left his father's
presence, his brother Esau came in
from hunting.
31He too prepared some tasty food and
brought it to his father. Then he said to
him, "My father, sit up and eat some of
my game, so that you may give me your
blessing."
32His father Isaac asked him, "Who are
you?" "I am your son," he answered,
"your firstborn, Esau."
33Isaac trembled violently and said,
"Who was it, then, that hunted game
and brought it to me? I ate it just before
you came and I blessed him-and indeed
he will be blessed!"
34When Esau heard his father's words,
he burst out with a loud and bitter cry
and said to his father, "Bless me-me too,
my father!"
35But he said, "Your brother came
deceitfully and took your blessing."
36Esau said, "Isn't he rightly named
Jacob ? He has deceived me these two
times: He took my birthright, and now
he's taken my blessing!" Then he asked,
"Haven't you reserved any blessing for
me?"
37Isaac answered Esau, "I have made
him lord over you and have made all his
relatives his servants, and I have
sustained him with grain and new wine.
So what can I possibly do for you, my
son?"
38Esau said to his father, "Do you have
only one blessing, my father? Bless me
too, my father!" Then Esau wept aloud.
39His father Isaac answered him, "Your
dwelling will be away from the earth's
richness, away from the dew of heaven
above.
40You will live by the sword and you will
serve your brother. But when you grow
restless, you will throw his yoke from off
your neck."
41Esau held a grudge against Jacob
because of the blessing his father had
given him. He said to himself, "The days
of mourning for my father are near; then
I will kill my brother Jacob."
42When Rebekah was told what her
older son Esau had said, she sent for
her younger son Jacob and said to him,
"Your brother Esau is consoling himself
with the thought of killing you.
43Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee
at once to my brother Laban in Haran.
44Stay with him for a while until your
brother's fury subsides.
45When your brother is no longer angry
with you and forgets what you did to him,
I'll send word for you to come back from
there. Why should I lose both of you in
one day?"
46Then Rebekah said to Isaac, "I'm
disgusted with living because of these
Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from
among the women of this land, from
Hittite women like these, my life will not
be worth living."
28So Isaac called for Jacob and
blessed him and commanded him: "Do
not marry a Canaanite woman.
2Go at once to Paddan Aram, to the
house of your mother's father Bethuel.
Take a wife for yourself there, from
among the daughters of Laban, your
mother's brother.
3May God Almighty bless you and make
you fruitful and increase your numbers
until you become a community of
peoples.
4May he give you and your descendants
the blessing given to Abraham, so that
you may take possession of the land
where you now live as an alien, the land
God gave to Abraham."
5Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and
he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son
of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of
Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob
and Esau.
6Now Esau learned that Isaac had
blessed Jacob and had sent him to
Paddan Aram to take a wife from there,
and that when he blessed him he
commanded him, "Do not marry a
Canaanite woman,"
7and that Jacob had obeyed his father
and mother and had gone to Paddan
Aram.
8Esau then realized how displeasing the
Canaanite women were to his father
Isaac;
9so he went to Ishmael and married
Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and
daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, in
addition to the wives he already had.
10Jacob left Beersheba and set out for
Haran.
11When he reached a certain place, he
stopped for the night because the sun
had set. Taking one of the stones there,
he put it under his head and lay down to
sleep.
12He had a dream in which he saw a
stairway resting on the earth, with its top
reaching to heaven, and the angels of
God were ascending and descending on
it.
13There above it stood the Lord , and he
said: "I am the Lord , the God of your
father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I
will give you and your descendants the
land on which you are lying.
14Your descendants will be like the dust
of the earth, and you will spread out to
the west and to the east, to the north
and to the south. All peoples on earth
will be blessed through you and your
offspring.
15I am with you and will watch over you
wherever you go, and I will bring you
back to this land. I will not leave you
until I have done what I have promised
you."
16When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he
thought, "Surely the Lord is in this place,
and I was not aware of it."
17He was afraid and said, "How
awesome is this place! This is none
other than the house of God; this is the
gate of heaven."
18Early the next morning Jacob took the
stone he had placed under his head and
set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top
of it.
19He called that place Bethel, though the
city used to be called Luz.
20Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If
God will be with me and will watch over
me on this journey I am taking and will
give me food to eat and clothes to wear
21so that I return safely to my father's
house, then the Lord will be my God
22and this stone that I have set up as a
pillar will be God's house, and of all that
you give me I will give you a tenth."
29Then Jacob continued on his
journey and came to the land of the
eastern peoples.
2There he saw a well in the field, with
three flocks of sheep lying near it
because the flocks were watered from
that well. The stone over the mouth of
the well was large.
3When all the flocks were gathered there,
the shepherds would roll the stone away
from the well's mouth and water the
sheep. Then they would return the stone
to its place over the mouth of the well.
4Jacob asked the shepherds, "My
brothers, where are you from?" "We're
from Haran," they replied.
5He said to them, "Do you know Laban,
Nahor's grandson?" "Yes, we know
him," they answered.
6Then Jacob asked them, "Is he well?"
"Yes, he is," they said, "and here comes
his daughter Rachel with the sheep."
7"Look," he said, "the sun is still high; it
is not time for the flocks to be gathered.
Water the sheep and take them back to
pasture."
8"We can't," they replied, "until all the
flocks are gathered and the stone has
been rolled away from the mouth of the
well. Then we will water the sheep."
9While he was still talking with them,
Rachel came with her father's sheep, for
she was a shepherdess.
10When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of
Laban, his mother's brother, and
Laban's sheep, he went over and rolled
the stone away from the mouth of the
well and watered his uncle's sheep.
11Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began
to weep aloud.
12He had told Rachel that he was a
relative of her father and a son of
Rebekah. So she ran and told her father.
13As soon as Laban heard the news
about Jacob, his sister's son, he hurried
to meet him. He embraced him and
kissed him and brought him to his home,
and there Jacob told him all these things.
14Then Laban said to him, "You are my
own flesh and blood." After Jacob had
stayed with him for a whole month,
15Laban said to him, "Just because you
are a relative of mine, should you work
for me for nothing? Tell me what your
wages should be."
16Now Laban had two daughters; the
name of the older was Leah, and the
name of the younger was Rachel.
17Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel was
lovely in form, and beautiful.
18Jacob was in love with Rachel and
said, "I'll work for you seven years in
return for your younger daughter
Rachel."
19Laban said, "It's better that I give her
to you than to some other man. Stay
here with me."
20So Jacob served seven years to get
Rachel, but they seemed like only a few
days to him because of his love for her.
21Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me
my wife. My time is completed, and I
want to lie with her."
22So Laban brought together all the
people of the place and gave a feast.
23But when evening came, he took his
daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob,
and Jacob lay with her.
24And Laban gave his servant girl Zilpah
to his daughter as her maidservant.
25When morning came, there was Leah!
So Jacob said to Laban, "What is this
you have done to me? I served you for
Rachel, didn't I? Why have you
deceived me?"
26Laban replied, "It is not our custom
here to give the younger daughter in
marriage before the older one.
27Finish this daughter's bridal week; then
we will give you the younger one also, in
return for another seven years of work."
28And Jacob did so. He finished the
week with Leah, and then Laban gave
him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.
29Laban gave his servant girl Bilhah to
his daughter Rachel as her maidservant.
30Jacob lay with Rachel also, and he
loved Rachel more than Leah. And he
worked for Laban another seven years.
31When the Lord saw that Leah was not
loved, he opened her womb, but Rachel
was barren.
32Leah became pregnant and gave birth
to a son. She named him Reuben, for
she said, "It is because the Lord has
seen my misery. Surely my husband will
love me now."
33She conceived again, and when she
gave birth to a son she said, "Because
the Lord heard that I am not loved, he
gave me this one too." So she named
him Simeon.
34Again she conceived, and when she
gave birth to a son she said, "Now at
last my husband will become attached
to me, because I have borne him three
sons." So he was named Levi.
35She conceived again, and when she
gave birth to a son she said, "This time I
will praise the Lord ." So she named him
Judah. Then she stopped having
children.
30When Rachel saw that she was
not bearing Jacob any children, she
became jealous of her sister. So she
said to Jacob, "Give me children, or I'll
die!"
2Jacob became angry with her and said,
"Am I in the place of God, who has kept
you from having children?"
3Then she said, "Here is Bilhah, my
maidservant. Sleep with her so that she
can bear children for me and that
through her I too can build a family."
4So she gave him her servant Bilhah as
a wife. Jacob slept with her,
5and she became pregnant and bore
him a son.
6Then Rachel said, "God has vindicated
me; he has listened to my plea and
given me a son." Because of this she
named him Dan.
7Rachel's servant Bilhah conceived
again and bore Jacob a second son.
8Then Rachel said, "I have had a great
struggle with my sister, and I have won."
So she named him Naphtali.
9When Leah saw that she had stopped
having children, she took her
maidservant Zilpah and gave her to
Jacob as a wife.
10Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a
son.
11Then Leah said, "What good fortune!"
So she named him Gad.
12Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a
second son.
13Then Leah said, "How happy I am!
The women will call me happy." So she
named him Asher.
14During wheat harvest, Reuben went
out into the fields and found some
mandrake plants, which he brought to
his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah,
"Please give me some of your son's
mandrakes."
15But she said to her, "Wasn't it enough
that you took away my husband? Will
you take my son's mandrakes too?"
"Very well," Rachel said, "he can sleep
with you tonight in return for your son's
mandrakes."
16So when Jacob came in from the fields
that evening, Leah went out to meet him.
"You must sleep with me," she said. "I
have hired you with my son's
mandrakes." So he slept with her that
night.
17God listened to Leah, and she became
pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son.
18Then Leah said, "God has rewarded
me for giving my maidservant to my
husband." So she named him Issachar.
19Leah conceived again and bore Jacob
a sixth son.
20Then Leah said, "God has presented
me with a precious gift. This time my
husband will treat me with honor,
because I have borne him six sons." So
she named him Zebulun.
21Some time later she gave birth to a
daughter and named her Dinah.
22Then God remembered Rachel; he
listened to her and opened her womb.
23She became pregnant and gave birth
to a son and said, "God has taken away
my disgrace."
24She named him Joseph, and said,
"May the Lord add to me another son."
25After Rachel gave birth to Joseph,
Jacob said to Laban, "Send me on my
way so I can go back to my own
homeland.
26Give me my wives and children, for
whom I have served you, and I will be
on my way. You know how much work
I've done for you."
27But Laban said to him, "If I have found
favor in your eyes, please stay. I have
learned by divination that the Lord has
blessed me because of you."
28He added, "Name your wages, and I
will pay them."
29Jacob said to him, "You know how I
have worked for you and how your
livestock has fared under my care.
30The little you had before I came has
increased greatly, and the Lord has
blessed you wherever I have been. But
now, when may I do something for my
own household?"
31"What shall I give you?" he asked.
"Don't give me anything," Jacob replied.
"But if you will do this one thing for me, I
will go on tending your flocks and
watching over them:
32Let me go through all your flocks today
and remove from them every speckled
or spotted sheep, every dark-colored
lamb and every spotted or speckled
goat. They will be my wages.
33And my honesty will testify for me in
the future, whenever you check on the
wages you have paid me. Any goat in
my possession that is not speckled or
spotted, or any lamb that is not darkcolored,
will be considered stolen."
34"Agreed," said Laban. "Let it be as you
have said."
35That same day he removed all the
male goats that were streaked or
spotted, and all the speckled or spotted
female goats (all that had white on
them) and all the dark-colored lambs,
and he placed them in the care of his
sons.
36Then he put a three-day journey
between himself and Jacob, while Jacob
continued to tend the rest of Laban's
flocks.
37Jacob, however, took fresh-cut
branches from poplar, almond and plane
trees and made white stripes on them
by peeling the bark and exposing the
white inner wood of the branches.
38Then he placed the peeled branches
in all the watering troughs, so that they
would be directly in front of the flocks
when they came to drink. When the
flocks were in heat and came to drink,
39they mated in front of the branches.
And they bore young that were streaked
or speckled or spotted.
40Jacob set apart the young of the flock
by themselves, but made the rest face
the streaked and dark-colored animals
that belonged to Laban. Thus he made
separate flocks for himself and did not
put them with Laban's animals.
41Whenever the stronger females were
in heat, Jacob would place the branches
in the troughs in front of the animals so
they would mate near the branches,
42but if the animals were weak, he would
not place them there. So the weak
animals went to Laban and the strong
ones to Jacob.
43In this way the man grew exceedingly
prosperous and came to own large
flocks, and maidservants and
menservants, and camels and donkeys.
31Jacob heard that Laban's sons
were saying, "Jacob has taken
everything our father owned and has
gained all this wealth from what
belonged to our father."
2And Jacob noticed that Laban's attitude
toward him was not what it had been.
3Then the Lord said to Jacob, "Go back
to the land of your fathers and to your
relatives, and I will be with you."
4So Jacob sent word to Rachel and
Leah to come out to the fields where his
flocks were.
5He said to them, "I see that your
father's attitude toward me is not what it
was before, but the God of my father
has been with me.
6You know that I've worked for your
father with all my strength,
7yet your father has cheated me by
changing my wages ten times. However,
God has not allowed him to harm me.
8If he said, 'The speckled ones will be
your wages,' then all the flocks gave
birth to speckled young; and if he said,
'The streaked ones will be your wages,'
then all the flocks bore streaked young.
9So God has taken away your father's
livestock and has given them to me.
10"In breeding season I once had a
dream in which I looked up and saw that
the male goats mating with the flock
were streaked, speckled or spotted.
11The angel of God said to me in the
dream, 'Jacob.' I answered, 'Here I am.'
12And he said, 'Look up and see that all
the male goats mating with the flock are
streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have
seen all that Laban has been doing to
you.
13I am the God of Bethel, where you
anointed a pillar and where you made a
vow to me. Now leave this land at once
and go back to your native land.' "
14Then Rachel and Leah replied, "Do we
still have any share in the inheritance of
our father's estate?
15Does he not regard us as foreigners?
Not only has he sold us, but he has
used up what was paid for us.
16Surely all the wealth that God took
away from our father belongs to us and
our children. So do whatever God has
told you."
17Then Jacob put his children and his
wives on camels,
18and he drove all his livestock ahead of
him, along with all the goods he had
accumulated in Paddan Aram, to go to
his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.
19When Laban had gone to shear his
sheep, Rachel stole her father's
household gods.
20Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the
Aramean by not telling him he was
running away.
21So he fled with all he had, and
crossing the River, he headed for the hill
country of Gilead.
22On the third day Laban was told that
Jacob had fled.
23Taking his relatives with him, he
pursued Jacob for seven days and
caught up with him in the hill country of
Gilead.
24Then God came to Laban the
Aramean in a dream at night and said to
him, "Be careful not to say anything to
Jacob, either good or bad."
25Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill
country of Gilead when Laban overtook
him, and Laban and his relatives
camped there too.
26Then Laban said to Jacob, "What have
you done? You've deceived me, and
you've carried off my daughters like
captives in war.
27Why did you run off secretly and
deceive me? Why didn't you tell me, so I
could send you away with joy and
singing to the music of tambourines and
harps?
28You didn't even let me kiss my
grandchildren and my daughters goodby.
You have done a foolish thing.
29I have the power to harm you; but last
night the God of your father said to me,
'Be careful not to say anything to Jacob,
either good or bad.'
30Now you have gone off because you
longed to return to your father's house.
But why did you steal my gods?"
31Jacob answered Laban, "I was afraid,
because I thought you would take your
daughters away from me by force.
32But if you find anyone who has your
gods, he shall not live. In the presence
of our relatives, see for yourself whether
there is anything of yours here with me;
and if so, take it." Now Jacob did not
know that Rachel had stolen the gods.
33So Laban went into Jacob's tent and
into Leah's tent and into the tent of the
two maidservants, but he found nothing.
After he came out of Leah's tent, he
entered Rachel's tent.
34Now Rachel had taken the household
gods and put them inside her camel's
saddle and was sitting on them. Laban
searched through everything in the tent
but found nothing.
35Rachel said to her father, "Don't be
angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in
your presence; I'm having my period."
So he searched but could not find the
household gods.
36Jacob was angry and took Laban to
task. "What is my crime?" he asked
Laban. "What sin have I committed that
you hunt me down?
37Now that you have searched through
all my goods, what have you found that
belongs to your household? Put it here
in front of your relatives and mine, and
let them judge between the two of us.
38"I have been with you for twenty years
now. Your sheep and goats have not
miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from
your flocks.
39I did not bring you animals torn by wild
beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you
demanded payment from me for
whatever was stolen by day or night.
40This was my situation: The heat
consumed me in the daytime and the
cold at night, and sleep fled from my
eyes.
41It was like this for the twenty years I
was in your household. I worked for you
fourteen years for your two daughters
and six years for your flocks, and you
changed my wages ten times.
42If the God of my father, the God of
Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not
been with me, you would surely have
sent me away empty-handed. But God
has seen my hardship and the toil of my
hands, and last night he rebuked you."
43Laban answered Jacob, "The women
are my daughters, the children are my
children, and the flocks are my flocks.
All you see is mine. Yet what can I do
today about these daughters of mine, or
about the children they have borne?
44Come now, let's make a covenant, you
and I, and let it serve as a witness
between us."
45So Jacob took a stone and set it up as
a pillar.
46He said to his relatives, "Gather some
stones." So they took stones and piled
them in a heap, and they ate there by
the heap.
47Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, and
Jacob called it Galeed.
48Laban said, "This heap is a witness
between you and me today." That is why
it was called Galeed.
49It was also called Mizpah, because he
said, "May the Lord keep watch between
you and me when we are away from
each other.
50If you mistreat my daughters or if you
take any wives besides my daughters,
even though no one is with us,
remember that God is a witness
between you and me."
51Laban also said to Jacob, "Here is this
heap, and here is this pillar I have set up
between you and me.
52This heap is a witness, and this pillar
is a witness, that I will not go past this
heap to your side to harm you and that
you will not go past this heap and pillar
to my side to harm me.
53May the God of Abraham and the God
of Nahor, the God of their father, judge
between us." So Jacob took an oath in
the name of the Fear of his father Isaac.
54He offered a sacrifice there in the hill
country and invited his relatives to a
meal. After they had eaten, they spent
the night there.
55Early the next morning Laban kissed
his grandchildren and his daughters and
blessed them. Then he left and returned
home.
32Jacob also went on his way, and
the angels of God met him.
2When Jacob saw them, he said, "This
is the camp of God!" So he named that
place Mahanaim.
3Jacob sent messengers ahead of him
to his brother Esau in the land of Seir,
the country of Edom.
4He instructed them: "This is what you
are to say to my master Esau: 'Your
servant Jacob says, I have been staying
with Laban and have remained there till
now.
5I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and
goats, menservants and maidservants.
Now I am sending this message to my
lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.' "
6When the messengers returned to
Jacob, they said, "We went to your
brother Esau, and now he is coming to
meet you, and four hundred men are
with him."
7In great fear and distress Jacob divided
the people who were with him into two
groups, and the flocks and herds and
camels as well.
8He thought, "If Esau comes and attacks
one group, the group that is left may
escape."
9Then Jacob prayed, "O God of my
father Abraham, God of my father Isaac,
O Lord , who said to me, 'Go back to
your country and your relatives, and I
will make you prosper,'
10I am unworthy of all the kindness and
faithfulness you have shown your
servant. I had only my staff when I
crossed this Jordan, but now I have
become two groups.
11Save me, I pray, from the hand of my
brother Esau, for I am afraid he will
come and attack me, and also the
mothers with their children.
12But you have said, 'I will surely make
you prosper and will make your
descendants like the sand of the sea,
which cannot be counted.' "
13He spent the night there, and from
what he had with him he selected a gift
for his brother Esau:
14two hundred female goats and twenty
male goats, two hundred ewes and
twenty rams,
15thirty female camels with their young,
forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty
female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
16He put them in the care of his servants,
each herd by itself, and said to his
servants, "Go ahead of me, and keep
some space between the herds."
17He instructed the one in the lead:
"When my brother Esau meets you and
asks, 'To whom do you belong, and
where are you going, and who owns all
these animals in front of you?'
18then you are to say, 'They belong to
your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent
to my lord Esau, and he is coming
behind us.' "
19He also instructed the second, the
third and all the others who followed the
herds: "You are to say the same thing to
Esau when you meet him.
20And be sure to say, 'Your servant
Jacob is coming behind us.' " For he
thought, "I will pacify him with these gifts
I am sending on ahead; later, when I
see him, perhaps he will receive me."
21So Jacob's gifts went on ahead of him,
but he himself spent the night in the
camp.
22That night Jacob got up and took his
two wives, his two maidservants and his
eleven sons and crossed the ford of the
Jabbok.
23After he had sent them across the
stream, he sent over all his possessions.
24So Jacob was left alone, and a man
wrestled with him till daybreak.
25When the man saw that he could not
overpower him, he touched the socket
of Jacob's hip so that his hip was
wrenched as he wrestled with the man.
26Then the man said, "Let me go, for it is
daybreak." But Jacob replied, "I will not
let you go unless you bless me."
27The man asked him, "What is your
name?" "Jacob," he answered.
28Then the man said, "Your name will no
longer be Jacob, but Israel, because
you have struggled with God and with
men and have overcome."
29Jacob said, "Please tell me your
name." But he replied, "Why do you ask
my name?" Then he blessed him there.
30So Jacob called the place Peniel,
saying, "It is because I saw God face to
face, and yet my life was spared."
31The sun rose above him as he passed
Peniel, and he was limping because of
his hip.
32Therefore to this day the Israelites do
not eat the tendon attached to the
socket of the hip, because the socket of
Jacob's hip was touched near the
tendon.
33Jacob looked up and there was
Esau, coming with his four hundred
men; so he divided the children among
Leah, Rachel and the two maidservants.
2He put the maidservants and their
children in front, Leah and her children
next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear.
3He himself went on ahead and bowed
down to the ground seven times as he
approached his brother.
4But Esau ran to meet Jacob and
embraced him; he threw his arms
around his neck and kissed him. And
they wept.
5Then Esau looked up and saw the
women and children. "Who are these
with you?" he asked. Jacob answered,
"They are the children God has
graciously given your servant."
6Then the maidservants and their
children approached and bowed down.
7Next, Leah and her children came and
bowed down. Last of all came Joseph
and Rachel, and they too bowed down.
8Esau asked, "What do you mean by all
these droves I met?" "To find favor in
your eyes, my lord," he said.
9But Esau said, "I already have plenty,
my brother. Keep what you have for
yourself."
10"No, please!" said Jacob. "If I have
found favor in your eyes, accept this gift
from me. For to see your face is like
seeing the face of God, now that you
have received me favorably.
11Please accept the present that was
brought to you, for God has been
gracious to me and I have all I need."
And because Jacob insisted, Esau
accepted it.
12Then Esau said, "Let us be on our
way; I'll accompany you."
13But Jacob said to him, "My lord knows
that the children are tender and that I
must care for the ewes and cows that
are nursing their young. If they are
driven hard just one day, all the animals
will die.
14So let my lord go on ahead of his
servant, while I move along slowly at the
pace of the droves before me and that
of the children, until I come to my lord in
Seir."
15Esau said, "Then let me leave some of
my men with you." "But why do that?"
Jacob asked. "Just let me find favor in
the eyes of my lord."
16So that day Esau started on his way
back to Seir.
17Jacob, however, went to Succoth,
where he built a place for himself and
made shelters for his livestock. That is
why the place is called Succoth.
18After Jacob came from Paddan Aram,
he arrived safely at the city of Shechem
in Canaan and camped within sight of
the city.
19For a hundred pieces of silver, he
bought from the sons of Hamor, the
father of Shechem, the plot of ground
where he pitched his tent.
20There he set up an altar and called it
El Elohe Israel.
34Now Dinah, the daughter Leah
had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the
women of the land.
2When Shechem son of Hamor the
Hivite, the ruler of that area, saw her, he
took her and violated her.
3His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter
of Jacob, and he loved the girl and
spoke tenderly to her.
4And Shechem said to his father Hamor,
"Get me this girl as my wife."
5When Jacob heard that his daughter
Dinah had been defiled, his sons were
in the fields with his livestock; so he kept
quiet about it until they came home.
6Then Shechem's father Hamor went
out to talk with Jacob.
7Now Jacob's sons had come in from
the fields as soon as they heard what
had happened. They were filled with
grief and fury, because Shechem had
done a disgraceful thing in Israel by
lying with Jacob's daughter-a thing that
should not be done.
8But Hamor said to them, "My son
Shechem has his heart set on your
daughter. Please give her to him as his
wife.
9Intermarry with us; give us your
daughters and take our daughters for
yourselves.
10You can settle among us; the land is
open to you. Live in it, trade in it, and
acquire property in it."
11Then Shechem said to Dinah's father
and brothers, "Let me find favor in your
eyes, and I will give you whatever you
ask.
12Make the price for the bride and the
gift I am to bring as great as you like,
and I'll pay whatever you ask me. Only
give me the girl as my wife."
13Because their sister Dinah had been
defiled, Jacob's sons replied deceitfully
as they spoke to Shechem and his
father Hamor.
14They said to them, "We can't do such
a thing; we can't give our sister to a man
who is not circumcised. That would be a
disgrace to us.
15We will give our consent to you on one
condition only: that you become like us
by circumcising all your males.
16Then we will give you our daughters
and take your daughters for ourselves.
We'll settle among you and become one
people with you.
17But if you will not agree to be
circumcised, we'll take our sister and
go."
18Their proposal seemed good to Hamor
and his son Shechem.
19The young man, who was the most
honored of all his father's household,
lost no time in doing what they said,
because he was delighted with Jacob's
daughter.
20So Hamor and his son Shechem went
to the gate of their city to speak to their
fellow townsmen.
21"These men are friendly toward us,"
they said. "Let them live in our land and
trade in it; the land has plenty of room
for them. We can marry their daughters
and they can marry ours.
22But the men will consent to live with us
as one people only on the condition that
our males be circumcised, as they
themselves are.
23Won't their livestock, their property and
all their other animals become ours? So
let us give our consent to them, and
they will settle among us."
24All the men who went out of the city
gate agreed with Hamor and his son
Shechem, and every male in the city
was circumcised.
25Three days later, while all of them
were still in pain, two of Jacob's sons,
Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took
their swords and attacked the
unsuspecting city, killing every male.
26They put Hamor and his son Shechem
to the sword and took Dinah from
Shechem's house and left.
27The sons of Jacob came upon the
dead bodies and looted the city where
their sister had been defiled.
28They seized their flocks and herds and
donkeys and everything else of theirs in
the city and out in the fields.
29They carried off all their wealth and all
their women and children, taking as
plunder everything in the houses.
30Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi,
"You have brought trouble on me by
making me a stench to the Canaanites
and Perizzites, the people living in this
land. We are few in number, and if they
join forces against me and attack me, I
and my household will be destroyed."
31But they replied, "Should he have
treated our sister like a prostitute?"
35Then God said to Jacob, "Go up
to Bethel and settle there, and build an
altar there to God, who appeared to you
when you were fleeing from your brother
Esau."
2So Jacob said to his household and to
all who were with him, "Get rid of the
foreign gods you have with you, and
purify yourselves and change your
clothes.
3Then come, let us go up to Bethel,
where I will build an altar to God, who
answered me in the day of my distress
and who has been with me wherever I
have gone."
4So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods
they had and the rings in their ears, and
Jacob buried them under the oak at
Shechem.
5Then they set out, and the terror of God
fell upon the towns all around them so
that no one pursued them.
6Jacob and all the people with him came
to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of
Canaan.
7There he built an altar, and he called
the place El Bethel, because it was
there that God revealed himself to him
when he was fleeing from his brother.
8Now Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died
and was buried under the oak below
Bethel. So it was named Allon Bacuth.
9After Jacob returned from Paddan
Aram, God appeared to him again and
blessed him.
10God said to him, "Your name is Jacob,
but you will no longer be called Jacob;
your name will be Israel. " So he named
him Israel.
11And God said to him, "I am God
Almighty ; be fruitful and increase in
number. A nation and a community of
nations will come from you, and kings
will come from your body.
12The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac
I also give to you, and I will give this
land to your descendants after you."
13Then God went up from him at the
place where he had talked with him.
14Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place
where God had talked with him, and he
poured out a drink offering on it; he also
poured oil on it.
15Jacob called the place where God had
talked with him Bethel.
16Then they moved on from Bethel.
While they were still some distance from
Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and
had great difficulty.
17And as she was having great difficulty
in childbirth, the midwife said to her,
"Don't be afraid, for you have another
son."
18As she breathed her last-for she was
dying-she named her son Ben-Oni. But
his father named him Benjamin.
19So Rachel died and was buried on the
way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
20Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar,
and to this day that pillar marks Rachel's
tomb.
21Israel moved on again and pitched his
tent beyond Migdal Eder.
22While Israel was living in that region,
Reuben went in and slept with his
father's concubine Bilhah, and Israel
heard of it. Jacob had twelve sons:
23The sons of Leah: Reuben the
firstborn of Jacob, Simeon, Levi, Judah,
Issachar and Zebulun.
24The sons of Rachel: Joseph and
Benjamin.
25The sons of Rachel's maidservant
Bilhah: Dan and Naphtali.
26The sons of Leah's maidservant
Zilpah: Gad and Asher. These were the
sons of Jacob, who were born to him in
Paddan Aram.
27Jacob came home to his father Isaac
in Mamre, near Kiriath Arba (that is,
Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had
stayed.
28Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years.
29Then he breathed his last and died
and was gathered to his people, old and
full of years. And his sons Esau and
Jacob buried him.
36This is the account of Esau (that is,
Edom).
2Esau took his wives from the women of
Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the
Hittite, and Oholibamah daughter of
Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the
Hivite-
3also Basemath daughter of Ishmael
and sister of Nebaioth.
4Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath
bore Reuel,
5and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam
and Korah. These were the sons of
Esau, who were born to him in Canaan.
6Esau took his wives and sons and
daughters and all the members of his
household, as well as his livestock and
all his other animals and all the goods
he had acquired in Canaan, and moved
to a land some distance from his brother
Jacob.
7Their possessions were too great for
them to remain together; the land where
they were staying could not support
them both because of their livestock.
8So Esau (that is, Edom) settled in the
hill country of Seir.
9This is the account of Esau the father of
the Edomites in the hill country of Seir.
10These are the names of Esau's sons:
Eliphaz, the son of Esau's wife Adah,
and Reuel, the son of Esau's wife
Basemath.
11The sons of Eliphaz: Teman, Omar,
Zepho, Gatam and Kenaz.
12Esau's son Eliphaz also had a
concubine named Timna, who bore him
Amalek. These were grandsons of
Esau's wife Adah.
13The sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah,
Shammah and Mizzah. These were
grandsons of Esau's wife Basemath.
14The sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah
daughter of Anah and granddaughter of
Zibeon, whom she bore to Esau: Jeush,
Jalam and Korah.
15These were the chiefs among Esau's
descendants: The sons of Eliphaz the
firstborn of Esau: Chiefs Teman, Omar,
Zepho, Kenaz,
16Korah, Gatam and Amalek. These
were the chiefs descended from Eliphaz
in Edom; they were grandsons of Adah.
17The sons of Esau's son Reuel: Chiefs
Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah.
These were the chiefs descended from
Reuel in Edom; they were grandsons of
Esau's wife Basemath.
18The sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah:
Chiefs Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These
were the chiefs descended from Esau's
wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
19These were the sons of Esau (that is,
Edom), and these were their chiefs.
20These were the sons of Seir the Horite,
who were living in the region: Lotan,
Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
21Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These sons
of Seir in Edom were Horite chiefs.
22The sons of Lotan: Hori and Homam.
Timna was Lotan's sister.
23The sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath,
Ebal, Shepho and Onam.
24The sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah.
This is the Anah who discovered the hot
springs in the desert while he was
grazing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
25The children of Anah: Dishon and
Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
26The sons of Dishon : Hemdan, Eshban,
Ithran and Keran.
27The sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan and
Akan.
28The sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
29These were the Horite chiefs: Lotan,
Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
30Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These were
the Horite chiefs, according to their
divisions, in the land of Seir.
31These were the kings who reigned in
Edom before any Israelite king reigned :
32Bela son of Beor became king of
Edom. His city was named Dinhabah.
33When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah
from Bozrah succeeded him as king.
34When Jobab died, Husham from the
land of the Temanites succeeded him as
king.
35When Husham died, Hadad son of
Bedad, who defeated Midian in the
country of Moab, succeeded him as king.
His city was named Avith.
36When Hadad died, Samlah from
Masrekah succeeded him as king.
37When Samlah died, Shaul from
Rehoboth on the river succeeded him as
king.
38When Shaul died, Baal-Hanan son of
Acbor succeeded him as king.
39When Baal-Hanan son of Acbor died,
Hadad succeeded him as king. His city
was named Pau, and his wife's name
was Mehetabel daughter of Matred, the
daughter of Me-Zahab.
40These were the chiefs descended from
Esau, by name, according to their clans
and regions: Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,
41Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,
42Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,
43Magdiel and Iram. These were the
chiefs of Edom, according to their
settlements in the land they occupied.
This was Esau the father of the
Edomites.
37Jacob lived in the land where his
father had stayed, the land of Canaan.
2This is the account of Jacob. Joseph, a
young man of seventeen, was tending
the flocks with his brothers, the sons of
Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his
father's wives, and he brought their
father a bad report about them.
3Now Israel loved Joseph more than any
of his other sons, because he had been
born to him in his old age; and he made
a richly ornamented robe for him.
4When his brothers saw that their father
loved him more than any of them, they
hated him and could not speak a kind
word to him.
5Joseph had a dream, and when he told
it to his brothers, they hated him all the
more.
6He said to them, "Listen to this dream I
had:
7We were binding sheaves of grain out
in the field when suddenly my sheaf
rose and stood upright, while your
sheaves gathered around mine and
bowed down to it."
8His brothers said to him, "Do you intend
to reign over us? Will you actually rule
us?" And they hated him all the more
because of his dream and what he had
said.
9Then he had another dream, and he
told it to his brothers. "Listen," he said, "I
had another dream, and this time the
sun and moon and eleven stars were
bowing down to me."
10When he told his father as well as his
brothers, his father rebuked him and
said, "What is this dream you had? Will
your mother and I and your brothers
actually come and bow down to the
ground before you?"
11His brothers were jealous of him, but
his father kept the matter in mind.
12Now his brothers had gone to graze
their father's flocks near Shechem,
13and Israel said to Joseph, "As you
know, your brothers are grazing the
flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going
to send you to them." "Very well," he
replied.
14So he said to him, "Go and see if all is
well with your brothers and with the
flocks, and bring word back to me."
Then he sent him off from the Valley of
Hebron. When Joseph arrived at
Shechem,
15a man found him wandering around in
the fields and asked him, "What are you
looking for?"
16He replied, "I'm looking for my brothers.
Can you tell me where they are grazing
their flocks?"
17"They have moved on from here," the
man answered. "I heard them say, 'Let's
go to Dothan.' " So Joseph went after
his brothers and found them near
Dothan.
18But they saw him in the distance, and
before he reached them, they plotted to
kill him.
19"Here comes that dreamer!" they said
to each other.
20"Come now, let's kill him and throw
him into one of these cisterns and say
that a ferocious animal devoured him.
Then we'll see what comes of his
dreams."
21When Reuben heard this, he tried to
rescue him from their hands. "Let's not
take his life," he said.
22"Don't shed any blood. Throw him into
this cistern here in the desert, but don't
lay a hand on him." Reuben said this to
rescue him from them and take him
back to his father.
23So when Joseph came to his brothers,
they stripped him of his robe-the richly
ornamented robe he was wearing-
24and they took him and threw him into
the cistern. Now the cistern was empty;
there was no water in it.
25As they sat down to eat their meal,
they looked up and saw a caravan of
Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their
camels were loaded with spices, balm
and myrrh, and they were on their way
to take them down to Egypt.
26Judah said to his brothers, "What will
we gain if we kill our brother and cover
up his blood?
27Come, let's sell him to the Ishmaelites
and not lay our hands on him; after all,
he is our brother, our own flesh and
blood." His brothers agreed.
28So when the Midianite merchants
came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up
out of the cistern and sold him for twenty
shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who
took him to Egypt.
29When Reuben returned to the cistern
and saw that Joseph was not there, he
tore his clothes.
30He went back to his brothers and said,
"The boy isn't there! Where can I turn
now?"
31Then they got Joseph's robe,
slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe
in the blood.
32They took the ornamented robe back
to their father and said, "We found this.
Examine it to see whether it is your
son's robe."
33He recognized it and said, "It is my
son's robe! Some ferocious animal has
devoured him. Joseph has surely been
torn to pieces."
34Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on
sackcloth and mourned for his son many
days.
35All his sons and daughters came to
comfort him, but he refused to be
comforted. "No," he said, "in mourning
will I go down to the grave to my son."
So his father wept for him.
36Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph
in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's
officials, the captain of the guard.
38At that time, Judah left his
brothers and went down to stay with a
man of Adullam named Hirah.
2There Judah met the daughter of a
Canaanite man named Shua. He
married her and lay with her;
3she became pregnant and gave birth to
a son, who was named Er.
4She conceived again and gave birth to
a son and named him Onan.
5She gave birth to still another son and
named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that
she gave birth to him.
6Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn,
and her name was Tamar.
7But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in
the Lord 's sight; so the Lord put him to
death.
8Then Judah said to Onan, "Lie with
your brother's wife and fulfill your duty to
her as a brother-in-law to produce
offspring for your brother."
9But Onan knew that the offspring would
not be his; so whenever he lay with his
brother's wife, he spilled his semen on
the ground to keep from producing
offspring for his brother.
10What he did was wicked in the Lord 's
sight; so he put him to death also.
11Judah then said to his daughter-in-law
Tamar, "Live as a widow in your father's
house until my son Shelah grows up."
For he thought, "He may die too, just
like his brothers." So Tamar went to live
in her father's house.
12After a long time Judah's wife, the
daughter of Shua, died. When Judah
had recovered from his grief, he went up
to Timnah, to the men who were
shearing his sheep, and his friend Hirah
the Adullamite went with him.
13When Tamar was told, "Your father-inlaw
is on his way to Timnah to shear his
sheep,"
14she took off her widow's clothes,
covered herself with a veil to disguise
herself, and then sat down at the
entrance to Enaim, which is on the road
to Timnah. For she saw that, though
Shelah had now grown up, she had not
been given to him as his wife.
15When Judah saw her, he thought she
was a prostitute, for she had covered
her face.
16Not realizing that she was his
daughter-in-law, he went over to her by
the roadside and said, "Come now, let
me sleep with you." "And what will you
give me to sleep with you?" she asked.
17"I'll send you a young goat from my
flock," he said. "Will you give me
something as a pledge until you send
it?" she asked.
18He said, "What pledge should I give
you?" "Your seal and its cord, and the
staff in your hand," she answered. So he
gave them to her and slept with her, and
she became pregnant by him.
19After she left, she took off her veil and
put on her widow's clothes again.
20Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat
by his friend the Adullamite in order to
get his pledge back from the woman,
but he did not find her.
21He asked the men who lived there,
"Where is the shrine prostitute who was
beside the road at Enaim?" "There
hasn't been any shrine prostitute here,"
they said.
22So he went back to Judah and said, "I
didn't find her. Besides, the men who
lived there said, 'There hasn't been any
shrine prostitute here.' "
23Then Judah said, "Let her keep what
she has, or we will become a
laughingstock. After all, I did send her
this young goat, but you didn't find her."
24About three months later Judah was
told, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar is
guilty of prostitution, and as a result she
is now pregnant." Judah said, "Bring her
out and have her burned to death!"
25As she was being brought out, she
sent a message to her father-in-law. "I
am pregnant by the man who owns
these," she said. And she added, "See if
you recognize whose seal and cord and
staff these are."
26Judah recognized them and said, "She
is more righteous than I, since I wouldn't
give her to my son Shelah." And he did
not sleep with her again.
27When the time came for her to give
birth, there were twin boys in her womb.
28As she was giving birth, one of them
put out his hand; so the midwife took a
scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and
said, "This one came out first."
29But when he drew back his hand, his
brother came out, and she said, "So this
is how you have broken out!" And he
was named Perez.
30Then his brother, who had the scarlet
thread on his wrist, came out and he
was given the name Zerah.
39Now Joseph had been taken
down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian
who was one of Pharaoh's officials, the
captain of the guard, bought him from
the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.
2The Lord was with Joseph and he
prospered, and he lived in the house of
his Egyptian master.
3When his master saw that the Lord was
with him and that the Lord gave him
success in everything he did,
4Joseph found favor in his eyes and
became his attendant. Potiphar put him
in charge of his household, and he
entrusted to his care everything he
owned.
5From the time he put him in charge of
his household and of all that he owned,
the Lord blessed the household of the
Egyptian because of Joseph. The
blessing of the Lord was on everything
Potiphar had, both in the house and in
the field.
6So he left in Joseph's care everything
he had; with Joseph in charge, he did
not concern himself with anything
except the food he ate. Now Joseph
was well-built and handsome,
7and after a while his master's wife took
notice of Joseph and said, "Come to bed
with me!"
8But he refused. "With me in charge," he
told her, "my master does not concern
himself with anything in the house;
everything he owns he has entrusted to
my care.
9No one is greater in this house than I
am. My master has withheld nothing
from me except you, because you are
his wife. How then could I do such a
wicked thing and sin against God?"
10And though she spoke to Joseph day
after day, he refused to go to bed with
her or even be with her.
11One day he went into the house to
attend to his duties, and none of the
household servants was inside.
12She caught him by his cloak and said,
"Come to bed with me!" But he left his
cloak in her hand and ran out of the
house.
13When she saw that he had left his
cloak in her hand and had run out of the
house,
14she called her household servants.
"Look," she said to them, "this Hebrew
has been brought to us to make sport of
us! He came in here to sleep with me,
but I screamed.
15When he heard me scream for help,
he left his cloak beside me and ran out
of the house."
16She kept his cloak beside her until his
master came home.
17Then she told him this story: "That
Hebrew slave you brought us came to
me to make sport of me.
18But as soon as I screamed for help, he
left his cloak beside me and ran out of
the house."
19When his master heard the story his
wife told him, saying, "This is how your
slave treated me," he burned with anger.
20Joseph's master took him and put him
in prison, the place where the king's
prisoners were confined. But while
Joseph was there in the prison,
21the Lord was with him; he showed him
kindness and granted him favor in the
eyes of the prison warden.
22So the warden put Joseph in charge of
all those held in the prison, and he was
made responsible for all that was done
there.
23The warden paid no attention to
anything under Joseph's care, because
the Lord was with Joseph and gave him
success in whatever he did.
40Some time later, the cupbearer
and the baker of the king of Egypt
offended their master, the king of Egypt.
2Pharaoh was angry with his two
officials, the chief cupbearer and the
chief baker,
3and put them in custody in the house of
the captain of the guard, in the same
prison where Joseph was confined.
4The captain of the guard assigned them
to Joseph, and he attended them. After
they had been in custody for some time,
5each of the two men-the cupbearer and
the baker of the king of Egypt, who were
being held in prison-had a dream the
same night, and each dream had a
meaning of its own.
6When Joseph came to them the next
morning, he saw that they were dejected.
7So he asked Pharaoh's officials who
were in custody with him in his master's
house, "Why are your faces so sad
today?"
8"We both had dreams," they answered,
"but there is no one to interpret them."
Then Joseph said to them, "Do not
interpretations belong to God? Tell me
your dreams."
9So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his
dream. He said to him, "In my dream I
saw a vine in front of me,
10and on the vine were three branches.
As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and
its clusters ripened into grapes.
11Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I
took the grapes, squeezed them into
Pharaoh's cup and put the cup in his
hand."
12"This is what it means," Joseph said to
him. "The three branches are three days.
13Within three days Pharaoh will lift up
your head and restore you to your
position, and you will put Pharaoh's cup
in his hand, just as you used to do when
you were his cupbearer.
14But when all goes well with you,
remember me and show me kindness;
mention me to Pharaoh and get me out
of this prison.
15For I was forcibly carried off from the
land of the Hebrews, and even here I
have done nothing to deserve being put
in a dungeon."
16When the chief baker saw that Joseph
had given a favorable interpretation, he
said to Joseph, "I too had a dream: On
my head were three baskets of bread.
17In the top basket were all kinds of
baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds
were eating them out of the basket on
my head."
18"This is what it means," Joseph said.
"The three baskets are three days.
19Within three days Pharaoh will lift off
your head and hang you on a tree. And
the birds will eat away your flesh."
20Now the third day was Pharaoh's
birthday, and he gave a feast for all his
officials. He lifted up the heads of the
chief cupbearer and the chief baker in
the presence of his officials:
21He restored the chief cupbearer to his
position, so that he once again put the
cup into Pharaoh's hand,
22but he hanged the chief baker, just as
Joseph had said to them in his
interpretation.
23The chief cupbearer, however, did not
remember Joseph; he forgot him.
41When two full years had passed,
Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing
by the Nile,
2when out of the river there came up
seven cows, sleek and fat, and they
grazed among the reeds.
3After them, seven other cows, ugly and
gaunt, came up out of the Nile and
stood beside those on the riverbank.
4And the cows that were ugly and gaunt
ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then
Pharaoh woke up.
5He fell asleep again and had a second
dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy
and good, were growing on a single
stalk.
6After them, seven other heads of grain
sprouted-thin and scorched by the east
wind.
7The thin heads of grain swallowed up
the seven healthy, full heads. Then
Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream.
8In the morning his mind was troubled,
so he sent for all the magicians and
wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them
his dreams, but no one could interpret
them for him.
9Then the chief cupbearer said to
Pharaoh, "Today I am reminded of my
shortcomings.
10Pharaoh was once angry with his
servants, and he imprisoned me and the
chief baker in the house of the captain
of the guard.
11Each of us had a dream the same
night, and each dream had a meaning of
its own.
12Now a young Hebrew was there with
us, a servant of the captain of the guard.
We told him our dreams, and he
interpreted them for us, giving each man
the interpretation of his dream.
13And things turned out exactly as he
interpreted them to us: I was restored to
my position, and the other man was
hanged. "
14So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he
was quickly brought from the dungeon.
When he had shaved and changed his
clothes, he came before Pharaoh.
15Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I had a
dream, and no one can interpret it. But I
have heard it said of you that when you
hear a dream you can interpret it."
16"I cannot do it," Joseph replied to
Pharaoh, "but God will give Pharaoh the
answer he desires."
17Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "In my
dream I was standing on the bank of the
Nile,
18when out of the river there came up
seven cows, fat and sleek, and they
grazed among the reeds.
19After them, seven other cows came
up-scrawny and very ugly and lean. I
had never seen such ugly cows in all the
land of Egypt.
20The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven
fat cows that came up first.
21But even after they ate them, no one
could tell that they had done so; they
looked just as ugly as before. Then I
woke up.
22"In my dreams I also saw seven heads
of grain, full and good, growing on a
single stalk.
23After them, seven other heads
sprouted-withered and thin and
scorched by the east wind.
24The thin heads of grain swallowed up
the seven good heads. I told this to the
magicians, but none could explain it to
me."
25Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The
dreams of Pharaoh are one and the
same. God has revealed to Pharaoh
what he is about to do.
26The seven good cows are seven years,
and the seven good heads of grain are
seven years; it is one and the same
dream.
27The seven lean, ugly cows that came
up afterward are seven years, and so
are the seven worthless heads of grain
scorched by the east wind: They are
seven years of famine.
28"It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has
shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.
29Seven years of great abundance are
coming throughout the land of Egypt,
30but seven years of famine will follow
them. Then all the abundance in Egypt
will be forgotten, and the famine will
ravage the land.
31The abundance in the land will not be
remembered, because the famine that
follows it will be so severe.
32The reason the dream was given to
Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter
has been firmly decided by God, and
God will do it soon.
33"And now let Pharaoh look for a
discerning and wise man and put him in
charge of the land of Egypt.
34Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners
over the land to take a fifth of the
harvest of Egypt during the seven years
of abundance.
35They should collect all the food of
these good years that are coming and
store up the grain under the authority of
Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food.
36This food should be held in reserve for
the country, to be used during the seven
years of famine that will come upon
Egypt, so that the country may not be
ruined by the famine."
37The plan seemed good to Pharaoh
and to all his officials.
38So Pharaoh asked them, "Can we find
anyone like this man, one in whom is
the spirit of God ?"
39Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since
God has made all this known to you,
there is no one so discerning and wise
as you.
40You shall be in charge of my palace,
and all my people are to submit to your
orders. Only with respect to the throne
will I be greater than you."
41So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I hereby
put you in charge of the whole land of
Egypt."
42Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from
his finger and put it on Joseph's finger.
He dressed him in robes of fine linen
and put a gold chain around his neck.
43He had him ride in a chariot as his
second-in-command, and men shouted
before him, "Make way !" Thus he put
him in charge of the whole land of Egypt.
44Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am
Pharaoh, but without your word no one
will lift hand or foot in all Egypt."
45Pharaoh gave Joseph the name
Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him
Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of
On, to be his wife. And Joseph went
throughout the land of Egypt.
46Joseph was thirty years old when he
entered the service of Pharaoh king of
Egypt. And Joseph went out from
Pharaoh's presence and traveled
throughout Egypt.
47During the seven years of abundance
the land produced plentifully.
48Joseph collected all the food produced
in those seven years of abundance in
Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each
city he put the food grown in the fields
surrounding it.
49Joseph stored up huge quantities of
grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so
much that he stopped keeping records
because it was beyond measure.
50Before the years of famine came, two
sons were born to Joseph by Asenath
daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
51Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh
and said, "It is because God has made
me forget all my trouble and all my
father's household."
52The second son he named Ephraim
and said, "It is because God has made
me fruitful in the land of my suffering."
53The seven years of abundance in
Egypt came to an end,
54and the seven years of famine began,
just as Joseph had said. There was
famine in all the other lands, but in the
whole land of Egypt there was food.
55When all Egypt began to feel the
famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for
food. Then Pharaoh told all the
Egyptians, "Go to Joseph and do what
he tells you."
56When the famine had spread over the
whole country, Joseph opened the
storehouses and sold grain to the
Egyptians, for the famine was severe
throughout Egypt.
57And all the countries came to Egypt to
buy grain from Joseph, because the
famine was severe in all the world.
42When Jacob learned that there
was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons,
"Why do you just keep looking at each
other?"
2He continued, "I have heard that there
is grain in Egypt. Go down there and
buy some for us, so that we may live
and not die."
3Then ten of Joseph's brothers went
down to buy grain from Egypt.
4But Jacob did not send Benjamin,
Joseph's brother, with the others,
because he was afraid that harm might
come to him.
5So Israel's sons were among those
who went to buy grain, for the famine
was in the land of Canaan also.
6Now Joseph was the governor of the
land, the one who sold grain to all its
people. So when Joseph's brothers
arrived, they bowed down to him with
their faces to the ground.
7As soon as Joseph saw his brothers,
he recognized them, but he pretended
to be a stranger and spoke harshly to
them. "Where do you come from?" he
asked. "From the land of Canaan," they
replied, "to buy food."
8Although Joseph recognized his
brothers, they did not recognize him.
9Then he remembered his dreams about
them and said to them, "You are spies!
You have come to see where our land is
unprotected."
10"No, my lord," they answered. "Your
servants have come to buy food.
11We are all the sons of one man. Your
servants are honest men, not spies."
12"No!" he said to them. "You have come
to see where our land is unprotected."
13But they replied, "Your servants were
twelve brothers, the sons of one man,
who lives in the land of Canaan. The
youngest is now with our father, and one
is no more."
14Joseph said to them, "It is just as I told
you: You are spies!
15And this is how you will be tested: As
surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not
leave this place unless your youngest
brother comes here.
16Send one of your number to get your
brother; the rest of you will be kept in
prison, so that your words may be
tested to see if you are telling the truth.
If you are not, then as surely as
Pharaoh lives, you are spies!"
17And he put them all in custody for
three days.
18On the third day, Joseph said to them,
"Do this and you will live, for I fear God:
19If you are honest men, let one of your
brothers stay here in prison, while the
rest of you go and take grain back for
your starving households.
20But you must bring your youngest
brother to me, so that your words may
be verified and that you may not die."
This they proceeded to do.
21They said to one another, "Surely we
are being punished because of our
brother. We saw how distressed he was
when he pleaded with us for his life, but
we would not listen; that's why this
distress has come upon us."
22Reuben replied, "Didn't I tell you not to
sin against the boy? But you wouldn't
listen! Now we must give an accounting
for his blood."
23They did not realize that Joseph could
understand them, since he was using an
interpreter.
24He turned away from them and began
to weep, but then turned back and
spoke to them again. He had Simeon
taken from them and bound before their
eyes.
25Joseph gave orders to fill their bags
with grain, to put each man's silver back
in his sack, and to give them provisions
for their journey. After this was done for
them,
26they loaded their grain on their
donkeys and left.
27At the place where they stopped for
the night one of them opened his sack
to get feed for his donkey, and he saw
his silver in the mouth of his sack.
28"My silver has been returned," he said
to his brothers. "Here it is in my sack."
Their hearts sank and they turned to
each other trembling and said, "What is
this that God has done to us?"
29When they came to their father Jacob
in the land of Canaan, they told him all
that had happened to them. They said,
30"The man who is lord over the land
spoke harshly to us and treated us as
though we were spying on the land.
31But we said to him, 'We are honest
men; we are not spies.
32We were twelve brothers, sons of one
father. One is no more, and the
youngest is now with our father in
Canaan.'
33"Then the man who is lord over the
land said to us, 'This is how I will know
whether you are honest men: Leave one
of your brothers here with me, and take
food for your starving households and
go.
34But bring your youngest brother to me
so I will know that you are not spies but
honest men. Then I will give your
brother back to you, and you can trade
in the land.' "
35As they were emptying their sacks,
there in each man's sack was his pouch
of silver! When they and their father saw
the money pouches, they were
frightened.
36Their father Jacob said to them, "You
have deprived me of my children.
Joseph is no more and Simeon is no
more, and now you want to take
Benjamin. Everything is against me!"
37Then Reuben said to his father, "You
may put both of my sons to death if I do
not bring him back to you. Entrust him to
my care, and I will bring him back."
38But Jacob said, "My son will not go
down there with you; his brother is dead
and he is the only one left. If harm
comes to him on the journey you are
taking, you will bring my gray head
down to the grave in sorrow."
43Now the famine was still severe in
the land.
2So when they had eaten all the grain
they had brought from Egypt, their father
said to them, "Go back and buy us a
little more food."
3But Judah said to him, "The man
warned us solemnly, 'You will not see
my face again unless your brother is
with you.'
4If you will send our brother along with
us, we will go down and buy food for
you.
5But if you will not send him, we will not
go down, because the man said to us,
'You will not see my face again unless
your brother is with you.' "
6Israel asked, "Why did you bring this
trouble on me by telling the man you
had another brother?"
7They replied, "The man questioned us
closely about ourselves and our family.
'Is your father still living?' he asked us.
'Do you have another brother?' We
simply answered his questions. How
were we to know he would say, 'Bring
your brother down here'?"
8Then Judah said to Israel his father,
"Send the boy along with me and we will
go at once, so that we and you and our
children may live and not die.
9I myself will guarantee his safety; you
can hold me personally responsible for
him. If I do not bring him back to you
and set him here before you, I will bear
the blame before you all my life.
10As it is, if we had not delayed, we
could have gone and returned twice."
11Then their father Israel said to them, "If
it must be, then do this: Put some of the
best products of the land in your bags
and take them down to the man as a
gift-a little balm and a little honey, some
spices and myrrh, some pistachio nuts
and almonds.
12Take double the amount of silver with
you, for you must return the silver that
was put back into the mouths of your
sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake.
13Take your brother also and go back to
the man at once.
14And may God Almighty grant you
mercy before the man so that he will let
your other brother and Benjamin come
back with you. As for me, if I am
bereaved, I am bereaved."
15So the men took the gifts and double
the amount of silver, and Benjamin also.
They hurried down to Egypt and
presented themselves to Joseph.
16When Joseph saw Benjamin with them,
he said to the steward of his house,
"Take these men to my house, slaughter
an animal and prepare dinner; they are
to eat with me at noon."
17The man did as Joseph told him and
took the men to Joseph's house.
18Now the men were frightened when
they were taken to his house. They
thought, "We were brought here
because of the silver that was put back
into our sacks the first time. He wants to
attack us and overpower us and seize
us as slaves and take our donkeys."
19So they went up to Joseph's steward
and spoke to him at the entrance to the
house.
20"Please, sir," they said, "we came
down here the first time to buy food.
21But at the place where we stopped for
the night we opened our sacks and each
of us found his silver-the exact weight-in
the mouth of his sack. So we have
brought it back with us.
22We have also brought additional silver
with us to buy food. We don't know who
put our silver in our sacks."
23"It's all right," he said. "Don't be afraid.
Your God, the God of your father, has
given you treasure in your sacks; I
received your silver." Then he brought
Simeon out to them.
24The steward took the men into
Joseph's house, gave them water to
wash their feet and provided fodder for
their donkeys.
25They prepared their gifts for Joseph's
arrival at noon, because they had heard
that they were to eat there.
26When Joseph came home, they
presented to him the gifts they had
brought into the house, and they bowed
down before him to the ground.
27He asked them how they were, and
then he said, "How is your aged father
you told me about? Is he still living?"
28They replied, "Your servant our father
is still alive and well." And they bowed
low to pay him honor.
29As he looked about and saw his
brother Benjamin, his own mother's son,
he asked, "Is this your youngest brother,
the one you told me about?" And he
said, "God be gracious to you, my son."
30Deeply moved at the sight of his
brother, Joseph hurried out and looked
for a place to weep. He went into his
private room and wept there.
31After he had washed his face, he
came out and, controlling himself, said,
"Serve the food."
32They served him by himself, the
brothers by themselves, and the
Egyptians who ate with him by
themselves, because Egyptians could
not eat with Hebrews, for that is
detestable to Egyptians.
33The men had been seated before him
in the order of their ages, from the
firstborn to the youngest; and they
looked at each other in astonishment.
34When portions were served to them
from Joseph's table, Benjamin's portion
was five times as much as anyone
else's. So they feasted and drank freely
with him.
44Now Joseph gave these
instructions to the steward of his house:
"Fill the men's sacks with as much food
as they can carry, and put each man's
silver in the mouth of his sack.
2Then put my cup, the silver one, in the
mouth of the youngest one's sack, along
with the silver for his grain." And he did
as Joseph said.
3As morning dawned, the men were sent
on their way with their donkeys.
4They had not gone far from the city
when Joseph said to his steward, "Go
after those men at once, and when you
catch up with them, say to them, 'Why
have you repaid good with evil?
5Isn't this the cup my master drinks from
and also uses for divination? This is a
wicked thing you have done.' "
6When he caught up with them, he
repeated these words to them.
7But they said to him, "Why does my
lord say such things? Far be it from your
servants to do anything like that!
8We even brought back to you from the
land of Canaan the silver we found
inside the mouths of our sacks. So why
would we steal silver or gold from your
master's house?
9If any of your servants is found to have
it, he will die; and the rest of us will
become my lord's slaves."
10"Very well, then," he said, "let it be as
you say. Whoever is found to have it will
become my slave; the rest of you will be
free from blame."
11Each of them quickly lowered his sack
to the ground and opened it.
12Then the steward proceeded to search,
beginning with the oldest and ending
with the youngest. And the cup was
found in Benjamin's sack.
13At this, they tore their clothes. Then
they all loaded their donkeys and
returned to the city.
14Joseph was still in the house when
Judah and his brothers came in, and
they threw themselves to the ground
before him.
15Joseph said to them, "What is this you
have done? Don't you know that a man
like me can find things out by
divination?"
16"What can we say to my lord?" Judah
replied. "What can we say? How can we
prove our innocence? God has
uncovered your servants' guilt. We are
now my lord's slaves-we ourselves and
the one who was found to have the
cup."
17But Joseph said, "Far be it from me to
do such a thing! Only the man who was
found to have the cup will become my
slave. The rest of you, go back to your
father in peace."
18Then Judah went up to him and said:
"Please, my lord, let your servant speak
a word to my lord. Do not be angry with
your servant, though you are equal to
Pharaoh himself.
19My lord asked his servants, 'Do you
have a father or a brother?'
20And we answered, 'We have an aged
father, and there is a young son born to
him in his old age. His brother is dead,
and he is the only one of his mother's
sons left, and his father loves him.'
21"Then you said to your servants, 'Bring
him down to me so I can see him for
myself.'
22And we said to my lord, 'The boy
cannot leave his father; if he leaves him,
his father will die.'
23But you told your servants, 'Unless
your youngest brother comes down with
you, you will not see my face again.'
24When we went back to your servant
my father, we told him what my lord had
said.
25"Then our father said, 'Go back and
buy a little more food.'
26But we said, 'We cannot go down.
Only if our youngest brother is with us
will we go. We cannot see the man's
face unless our youngest brother is with
us.'
27"Your servant my father said to us,
'You know that my wife bore me two
sons.
28One of them went away from me, and I
said, "He has surely been torn to
pieces." And I have not seen him since.
29If you take this one from me too and
harm comes to him, you will bring my
gray head down to the grave in misery.'
30"So now, if the boy is not with us when
I go back to your servant my father and
if my father, whose life is closely bound
up with the boy's life,
31sees that the boy isn't there, he will die.
Your servants will bring the gray head of
our father down to the grave in sorrow.
32Your servant guaranteed the boy's
safety to my father. I said, 'If I do not
bring him back to you, I will bear the
blame before you, my father, all my life!'
33"Now then, please let your servant
remain here as my lord's slave in place
of the boy, and let the boy return with
his brothers.
34How can I go back to my father if the
boy is not with me? No! Do not let me
see the misery that would come upon
my father."
45Then Joseph could no longer
control himself before all his attendants,
and he cried out, "Have everyone leave
my presence!" So there was no one with
Joseph when he made himself known to
his brothers.
2And he wept so loudly that the
Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh's
household heard about it.
3Joseph said to his brothers, "I am
Joseph! Is my father still living?" But his
brothers were not able to answer him,
because they were terrified at his
presence.
4Then Joseph said to his brothers,
"Come close to me." When they had
done so, he said, "I am your brother
Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt!
5And now, do not be distressed and do
not be angry with yourselves for selling
me here, because it was to save lives
that God sent me ahead of you.
6For two years now there has been
famine in the land, and for the next five
years there will not be plowing and
reaping.
7But God sent me ahead of you to
preserve for you a remnant on earth and
to save your lives by a great deliverance.
8"So then, it was not you who sent me
here, but God. He made me father to
Pharaoh, lord of his entire household
and ruler of all Egypt.
9Now hurry back to my father and say to
him, 'This is what your son Joseph says:
God has made me lord of all Egypt.
Come down to me; don't delay.
10You shall live in the region of Goshen
and be near me-you, your children and
grandchildren, your flocks and herds,
and all you have.
11I will provide for you there, because
five years of famine are still to come.
Otherwise you and your household and
all who belong to you will become
destitute.'
12"You can see for yourselves, and so
can my brother Benjamin, that it is really
I who am speaking to you.
13Tell my father about all the honor
accorded me in Egypt and about
everything you have seen. And bring my
father down here quickly."
14Then he threw his arms around his
brother Benjamin and wept, and
Benjamin embraced him, weeping.
15And he kissed all his brothers and
wept over them. Afterward his brothers
talked with him.
16When the news reached Pharaoh's
palace that Joseph's brothers had come,
Pharaoh and all his officials were
pleased.
17Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your
brothers, 'Do this: Load your animals
and return to the land of Canaan,
18and bring your father and your families
back to me. I will give you the best of
the land of Egypt and you can enjoy the
fat of the land.'
19"You are also directed to tell them, 'Do
this: Take some carts from Egypt for
your children and your wives, and get
your father and come.
20Never mind about your belongings,
because the best of all Egypt will be
yours.' "
21So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph
gave them carts, as Pharaoh had
commanded, and he also gave them
provisions for their journey.
22To each of them he gave new clothing,
but to Benjamin he gave three hundred
shekels of silver and five sets of clothes.
23And this is what he sent to his father:
ten donkeys loaded with the best things
of Egypt, and ten female donkeys
loaded with grain and bread and other
provisions for his journey.
24Then he sent his brothers away, and
as they were leaving he said to them,
"Don't quarrel on the way!"
25So they went up out of Egypt and
came to their father Jacob in the land of
Canaan.
26They told him, "Joseph is still alive! In
fact, he is ruler of all Egypt." Jacob was
stunned; he did not believe them.
27But when they told him everything
Joseph had said to them, and when he
saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry
him back, the spirit of their father Jacob
revived.
28And Israel said, "I'm convinced! My
son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see
him before I die."
46So Israel set out with all that was
his, and when he reached Beersheba,
he offered sacrifices to the God of his
father Isaac.
2And God spoke to Israel in a vision at
night and said, "Jacob! Jacob!" "Here I
am," he replied.
3"I am God, the God of your father," he
said. "Do not be afraid to go down to
Egypt, for I will make you into a great
nation there.
4I will go down to Egypt with you, and I
will surely bring you back again. And
Joseph's own hand will close your
eyes."
5Then Jacob left Beersheba, and Israel's
sons took their father Jacob and their
children and their wives in the carts that
Pharaoh had sent to transport him.
6They also took with them their livestock
and the possessions they had acquired
in Canaan, and Jacob and all his
offspring went to Egypt.
7He took with him to Egypt his sons and
grandsons and his daughters and
granddaughters-all his offspring.
8These are the names of the sons of
Israel (Jacob and his descendants) who
went to Egypt: Reuben the firstborn of
Jacob.
9The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu,
Hezron and Carmi.
10The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin,
Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of
a Canaanite woman.
11The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath
and Merari.
12The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah,
Perez and Zerah (but Er and Onan had
died in the land of Canaan). The sons of
Perez: Hezron and Hamul.
13The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puah,
Jashub and Shimron.
14The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon and
Jahleel.
15These were the sons Leah bore to
Jacob in Paddan Aram, besides his
daughter Dinah. These sons and
daughters of his were thirty-three in all.
16The sons of Gad: Zephon, Haggi,
Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi and Areli.
17The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah,
Ishvi and Beriah. Their sister was Serah.
The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malkiel.
18These were the children born to Jacob
by Zilpah, whom Laban had given to his
daughter Leah-sixteen in all.
19The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel:
Joseph and Benjamin.
20In Egypt, Manasseh and Ephraim were
born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of
Potiphera, priest of On.
21The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Beker,
Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh,
Muppim, Huppim and Ard.
22These were the sons of Rachel who
were born to Jacob-fourteen in all.
23The son of Dan: Hushim.
24The sons of Naphtali: Jahziel, Guni,
Jezer and Shillem.
25These were the sons born to Jacob by
Bilhah, whom Laban had given to his
daughter Rachel-seven in all.
26All those who went to Egypt with
Jacob-those who were his direct
descendants, not counting his sons'
wives-numbered sixty-six persons.
27With the two sons who had been born
to Joseph in Egypt, the members of
Jacob's family, which went to Egypt,
were seventy in all.
28Now Jacob sent Judah ahead of him
to Joseph to get directions to Goshen.
When they arrived in the region of
Goshen,
29Joseph had his chariot made ready
and went to Goshen to meet his father
Israel. As soon as Joseph appeared
before him, he threw his arms around
his father and wept for a long time.
30Israel said to Joseph, "Now I am ready
to die, since I have seen for myself that
you are still alive."
31Then Joseph said to his brothers and
to his father's household, "I will go up
and speak to Pharaoh and will say to
him, 'My brothers and my father's
household, who were living in the land
of Canaan, have come to me.
32The men are shepherds; they tend
livestock, and they have brought along
their flocks and herds and everything
they own.'
33When Pharaoh calls you in and asks,
'What is your occupation?'
34you should answer, 'Your servants
have tended livestock from our boyhood
on, just as our fathers did.' Then you will
be allowed to settle in the region of
Goshen, for all shepherds are
detestable to the Egyptians."
47Joseph went and told Pharaoh,
"My father and brothers, with their flocks
and herds and everything they own,
have come from the land of Canaan and
are now in Goshen."
2He chose five of his brothers and
presented them before Pharaoh.
3Pharaoh asked the brothers, "What is
your occupation?" "Your servants are
shepherds," they replied to Pharaoh,
"just as our fathers were."
4They also said to him, "We have come
to live here awhile, because the famine
is severe in Canaan and your servants'
flocks have no pasture. So now, please
let your servants settle in Goshen."
5Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Your father
and your brothers have come to you,
6and the land of Egypt is before you;
settle your father and your brothers in
the best part of the land. Let them live in
Goshen. And if you know of any among
them with special ability, put them in
charge of my own livestock."
7Then Joseph brought his father Jacob
in and presented him before Pharaoh.
After Jacob blessed Pharaoh,
8Pharaoh asked him, "How old are
you?"
9And Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The years
of my pilgrimage are a hundred and
thirty. My years have been few and
difficult, and they do not equal the years
of the pilgrimage of my fathers."
10Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and
went out from his presence.
11So Joseph settled his father and his
brothers in Egypt and gave them
property in the best part of the land, the
district of Rameses, as Pharaoh
directed.
12Joseph also provided his father and
his brothers and all his father's
household with food, according to the
number of their children.
13There was no food, however, in the
whole region because the famine was
severe; both Egypt and Canaan wasted
away because of the famine.
14Joseph collected all the money that
was to be found in Egypt and Canaan in
payment for the grain they were buying,
and he brought it to Pharaoh's palace.
15When the money of the people of
Egypt and Canaan was gone, all Egypt
came to Joseph and said, "Give us food.
Why should we die before your eyes?
Our money is used up."
16"Then bring your livestock," said
Joseph. "I will sell you food in exchange
for your livestock, since your money is
gone."
17So they brought their livestock to
Joseph, and he gave them food in
exchange for their horses, their sheep
and goats, their cattle and donkeys. And
he brought them through that year with
food in exchange for all their livestock.
18When that year was over, they came
to him the following year and said, "We
cannot hide from our lord the fact that
since our money is gone and our
livestock belongs to you, there is
nothing left for our lord except our
bodies and our land.
19Why should we perish before your
eyes-we and our land as well? Buy us
and our land in exchange for food, and
we with our land will be in bondage to
Pharaoh. Give us seed so that we may
live and not die, and that the land may
not become desolate."
20So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt
for Pharaoh. The Egyptians, one and all,
sold their fields, because the famine
was too severe for them. The land
became Pharaoh's,
21and Joseph reduced the people to
servitude, from one end of Egypt to the
other.
22However, he did not buy the land of
the priests, because they received a
regular allotment from Pharaoh and had
food enough from the allotment Pharaoh
gave them. That is why they did not sell
their land.
23Joseph said to the people, "Now that I
have bought you and your land today for
Pharaoh, here is seed for you so you
can plant the ground.
24But when the crop comes in, give a
fifth of it to Pharaoh. The other four-fifths
you may keep as seed for the fields and
as food for yourselves and your
households and your children."
25"You have saved our lives," they said.
"May we find favor in the eyes of our
lord; we will be in bondage to Pharaoh."
26So Joseph established it as a law
concerning land in Egypt-still in force
today-that a fifth of the produce belongs
to Pharaoh. It was only the land of the
priests that did not become Pharaoh's.
27Now the Israelites settled in Egypt in
the region of Goshen. They acquired
property there and were fruitful and
increased greatly in number.
28Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years,
and the years of his life were a hundred
and forty-seven.
29When the time drew near for Israel to
die, he called for his son Joseph and
said to him, "If I have found favor in your
eyes, put your hand under my thigh and
promise that you will show me kindness
and faithfulness. Do not bury me in
Egypt,
30but when I rest with my fathers, carry
me out of Egypt and bury me where
they are buried." "I will do as you say,"
he said.
31"Swear to me," he said. Then Joseph
swore to him, and Israel worshiped as
he leaned on the top of his staff.
48Some time later Joseph was told,
"Your father is ill." So he took his two
sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with
him.
2When Jacob was told, "Your son
Joseph has come to you," Israel rallied
his strength and sat up on the bed.
3Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty
appeared to me at Luz in the land of
Canaan, and there he blessed me
4and said to me, 'I am going to make
you fruitful and will increase your
numbers. I will make you a community
of peoples, and I will give this land as an
everlasting possession to your
descendants after you.'
5"Now then, your two sons born to you
in Egypt before I came to you here will
be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and
Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben
and Simeon are mine.
6Any children born to you after them will
be yours; in the territory they inherit they
will be reckoned under the names of
their brothers.
7As I was returning from Paddan, to my
sorrow Rachel died in the land of
Canaan while we were still on the way,
a little distance from Ephrath. So I
buried her there beside the road to
Ephrath" (that is, Bethlehem).
8When Israel saw the sons of Joseph,
he asked, "Who are these?"
9"They are the sons God has given me
here," Joseph said to his father. Then
Israel said, "Bring them to me so I may
bless them."
10Now Israel's eyes were failing because
of old age, and he could hardly see. So
Joseph brought his sons close to him,
and his father kissed them and
embraced them.
11Israel said to Joseph, "I never
expected to see your face again, and
now God has allowed me to see your
children too."
12Then Joseph removed them from
Israel's knees and bowed down with his
face to the ground.
13And Joseph took both of them,
Ephraim on his right toward Israel's left
hand and Manasseh on his left toward
Israel's right hand, and brought them
close to him.
14But Israel reached out his right hand
and put it on Ephraim's head, though he
was the younger, and crossing his arms,
he put his left hand on Manasseh's head,
even though Manasseh was the
firstborn.
15Then he blessed Joseph and said,
"May the God before whom my fathers
Abraham and Isaac walked, the God
who has been my shepherd all my life to
this day,
16the Angel who has delivered me from
all harm -may he bless these boys. May
they be called by my name and the
names of my fathers Abraham and
Isaac, and may they increase greatly
upon the earth."
17When Joseph saw his father placing
his right hand on Ephraim's head he
was displeased; so he took hold of his
father's hand to move it from Ephraim's
head to Manasseh's head.
18Joseph said to him, "No, my father,
this one is the firstborn; put your right
hand on his head."
19But his father refused and said, "I
know, my son, I know. He too will
become a people, and he too will
become great. Nevertheless, his
younger brother will be greater than he,
and his descendants will become a
group of nations."
20He blessed them that day and said, "In
your name will Israel pronounce this
blessing: 'May God make you like
Ephraim and Manasseh.' " So he put
Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.
21Then Israel said to Joseph, "I am
about to die, but God will be with you
and take you back to the land of your
fathers.
22And to you, as one who is over your
brothers, I give the ridge of land I took
from the Amorites with my sword and
my bow."
49Then Jacob called for his sons
and said: "Gather around so I can tell
you what will happen to you in days to
come.
2"Assemble and listen, sons of Jacob;
listen to your father Israel.
3"Reuben, you are my firstborn, my
might, the first sign of my strength,
excelling in honor, excelling in power.
4Turbulent as the waters, you will no
longer excel, for you went up onto your
father's bed, onto my couch and defiled
it.
5"Simeon and Levi are brothers- their
swords are weapons of violence.
6Let me not enter their council, let me
not join their assembly, for they have
killed men in their anger and hamstrung
oxen as they pleased.
7Cursed be their anger, so fierce, and
their fury, so cruel! I will scatter them in
Jacob and disperse them in Israel.
8"Judah, your brothers will praise you;
your hand will be on the neck of your
enemies; your father's sons will bow
down to you.
9You are a lion's cub, O Judah; you
return from the prey, my son. Like a lion
he crouches and lies down, like a
lioness-who dares to rouse him?
10The scepter will not depart from Judah,
nor the ruler's staff from between his
feet, until he comes to whom it belongs
and the obedience of the nations is his.
11He will tether his donkey to a vine, his
colt to the choicest branch; he will wash
his garments in wine, his robes in the
blood of grapes.
12His eyes will be darker than wine, his
teeth whiter than milk.
13"Zebulun will live by the seashore and
become a haven for ships; his border
will extend toward Sidon.
14"Issachar is a rawboned donkey lying
down between two saddlebags.
15When he sees how good is his resting
place and how pleasant is his land, he
will bend his shoulder to the burden and
submit to forced labor.
16"Dan will provide justice for his people
as one of the tribes of Israel.
17Dan will be a serpent by the roadside,
a viper along the path, that bites the
horse's heels so that its rider tumbles
backward.
18"I look for your deliverance, O Lord .
19"Gad will be attacked by a band of
raiders, but he will attack them at their
heels.
20"Asher's food will be rich; he will
provide delicacies fit for a king.
21"Naphtali is a doe set free that bears
beautiful fawns.
22"Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine
near a spring, whose branches climb
over a wall.
23With bitterness archers attacked him;
they shot at him with hostility.
24But his bow remained steady, his
strong arms stayed limber, because of
the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob,
because of the Shepherd, the Rock of
Israel,
25because of your father's God, who
helps you, because of the Almighty, who
blesses you with blessings of the
heavens above, blessings of the deep
that lies below, blessings of the breast
and womb.
26Your father's blessings are greater
than the blessings of the ancient
mountains, than the bounty of the ageold
hills. Let all these rest on the head of
Joseph, on the brow of the prince
among his brothers.
27"Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the
morning he devours the prey, in the
evening he divides the plunder."
28All these are the twelve tribes of Israel,
and this is what their father said to them
when he blessed them, giving each the
blessing appropriate to him.
29Then he gave them these instructions:
"I am about to be gathered to my people.
Bury me with my fathers in the cave in
the field of Ephron the Hittite,
30the cave in the field of Machpelah,
near Mamre in Canaan, which Abraham
bought as a burial place from Ephron
the Hittite, along with the field.
31There Abraham and his wife Sarah
were buried, there Isaac and his wife
Rebekah were buried, and there I buried
Leah.
32The field and the cave in it were
bought from the Hittites. "
33When Jacob had finished giving
instructions to his sons, he drew his feet
up into the bed, breathed his last and
was gathered to his people.
50Joseph threw himself upon his
father and wept over him and kissed him.
2Then Joseph directed the physicians in
his service to embalm his father Israel.
So the physicians embalmed him,
3taking a full forty days, for that was the
time required for embalming. And the
Egyptians mourned for him seventy
days.
4When the days of mourning had
passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh's court,
"If I have found favor in your eyes,
speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him,
5'My father made me swear an oath and
said, "I am about to die; bury me in the
tomb I dug for myself in the land of
Canaan." Now let me go up and bury my
father; then I will return.' "
6Pharaoh said, "Go up and bury your
father, as he made you swear to do."
7So Joseph went up to bury his father.
All Pharaoh's officials accompanied himthe
dignitaries of his court and all the
dignitaries of Egypt-
8besides all the members of Joseph's
household and his brothers and those
belonging to his father's household.
Only their children and their flocks and
herds were left in Goshen.
9Chariots and horsemen also went up
with him. It was a very large company.
10When they reached the threshing floor
of Atad, near the Jordan, they lamented
loudly and bitterly; and there Joseph
observed a seven-day period of
mourning for his father.
11When the Canaanites who lived there
saw the mourning at the threshing floor
of Atad, they said, "The Egyptians are
holding a solemn ceremony of
mourning." That is why that place near
the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim.
12So Jacob's sons did as he had
commanded them:
13They carried him to the land of
Canaan and buried him in the cave in
the field of Machpelah, near Mamre,
which Abraham had bought as a burial
place from Ephron the Hittite, along with
the field.
14After burying his father, Joseph
returned to Egypt, together with his
brothers and all the others who had
gone with him to bury his father.
15When Joseph's brothers saw that their
father was dead, they said, "What if
Joseph holds a grudge against us and
pays us back for all the wrongs we did
to him?"
16So they sent word to Joseph, saying,
"Your father left these instructions
before he died:
17'This is what you are to say to Joseph:
I ask you to forgive your brothers the
sins and the wrongs they committed in
treating you so badly.' Now please
forgive the sins of the servants of the
God of your father." When their
message came to him, Joseph wept.
18His brothers then came and threw
themselves down before him. "We are
your slaves," they said.
19But Joseph said to them, "Don't be
afraid. Am I in the place of God?
20You intended to harm me, but God
intended it for good to accomplish what
is now being done, the saving of many
lives.
21So then, don't be afraid. I will provide
for you and your children." And he
reassured them and spoke kindly to
them.
22Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all
his father's family. He lived a hundred
and ten years
23and saw the third generation of
Ephraim's children. Also the children of
Makir son of Manasseh were placed at
birth on Joseph's knees.
24Then Joseph said to his brothers, "I
am about to die. But God will surely
come to your aid and take you up out of
this land to the land he promised on
oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
25And Joseph made the sons of Israel
swear an oath and said, "God will surely
come to your aid, and then you must
carry my bones up from this place."
26So Joseph died at the age of a
hundred and ten. And after they
embalmed him, he was placed in a
coffin in Egypt.
Exodus
1These are the names of the sons of
Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob,
each with his family:
2Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;
3Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;
4Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.
5The descendants of Jacob numbered
seventy in all; Joseph was already in
Egypt.
6Now Joseph and all his brothers and all
that generation died,
7but the Israelites were fruitful and
multiplied greatly and became
exceedingly numerous, so that the land
was filled with them.
8Then a new king, who did not know
about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.
9"Look," he said to his people, "the
Israelites have become much too
numerous for us.
10Come, we must deal shrewdly with
them or they will become even more
numerous and, if war breaks out, will
join our enemies, fight against us and
leave the country."
11So they put slave masters over them
to oppress them with forced labor, and
they built Pithom and Rameses as store
cities for Pharaoh.
12But the more they were oppressed, the
more they multiplied and spread; so the
Egyptians came to dread the Israelites
13and worked them ruthlessly.
14They made their lives bitter with hard
labor in brick and mortar and with all
kinds of work in the fields; in all their
hard labor the Egyptians used them
ruthlessly.
15The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew
midwives, whose names were Shiphrah
and Puah,
16"When you help the Hebrew women in
childbirth and observe them on the
delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if
it is a girl, let her live."
17The midwives, however, feared God
and did not do what the king of Egypt
had told them to do; they let the boys
live.
18Then the king of Egypt summoned the
midwives and asked them, "Why have
you done this? Why have you let the
boys live?"
19The midwives answered Pharaoh,
"Hebrew women are not like Egyptian
women; they are vigorous and give birth
before the midwives arrive."
20So God was kind to the midwives and
the people increased and became even
more numerous.
21And because the midwives feared God,
he gave them families of their own.
22Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his
people: "Every boy that is born you must
throw into the Nile, but let every girl
live."
2Now a man of the house of Levi
married a Levite woman,
2and she became pregnant and gave
birth to a son. When she saw that he
was a fine child, she hid him for three
months.
3But when she could hide him no longer,
she got a papyrus basket for him and
coated it with tar and pitch. Then she
placed the child in it and put it among
the reeds along the bank of the Nile.
4His sister stood at a distance to see
what would happen to him.
5Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to
the Nile to bathe, and her attendants
were walking along the river bank. She
saw the basket among the reeds and
sent her slave girl to get it.
6She opened it and saw the baby. He
was crying, and she felt sorry for him.
"This is one of the Hebrew babies," she
said.
7Then his sister asked Pharaoh's
daughter, "Shall I go and get one of the
Hebrew women to nurse the baby for
you?"
8"Yes, go," she answered. And the girl
went and got the baby's mother.
9Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take
this baby and nurse him for me, and I
will pay you." So the woman took the
baby and nursed him.
10When the child grew older, she took
him to Pharaoh's daughter and he
became her son. She named him Moses,
saying, "I drew him out of the water."
11One day, after Moses had grown up,
he went out to where his own people
were and watched them at their hard
labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a
Hebrew, one of his own people.
12Glancing this way and that and seeing
no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid
him in the sand.
13The next day he went out and saw two
Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in
the wrong, "Why are you hitting your
fellow Hebrew?"
14The man said, "Who made you ruler
and judge over us? Are you thinking of
killing me as you killed the Egyptian?"
Then Moses was afraid and thought,
"What I did must have become known."
15When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried
to kill Moses, but Moses fled from
Pharaoh and went to live in Midian,
where he sat down by a well.
16Now a priest of Midian had seven
daughters, and they came to draw water
and fill the troughs to water their father's
flock.
17Some shepherds came along and
drove them away, but Moses got up and
came to their rescue and watered their
flock.
18When the girls returned to Reuel their
father, he asked them, "Why have you
returned so early today?"
19They answered, "An Egyptian rescued
us from the shepherds. He even drew
water for us and watered the flock."
20"And where is he?" he asked his
daughters. "Why did you leave him?
Invite him to have something to eat."
21Moses agreed to stay with the man,
who gave his daughter Zipporah to
Moses in marriage.
22Zipporah gave birth to a son, and
Moses named him Gershom, saying, "I
have become an alien in a foreign land."
23During that long period, the king of
Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in
their slavery and cried out, and their cry
for help because of their slavery went up
to God.
24God heard their groaning and he
remembered his covenant with Abraham,
with Isaac and with Jacob.
25So God looked on the Israelites and
was concerned about them.
3Now Moses was tending the flock of
Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of
Midian, and he led the flock to the far
side of the desert and came to Horeb,
the mountain of God.
2There the angel of the Lord appeared
to him in flames of fire from within a
bush. Moses saw that though the bush
was on fire it did not burn up.
3So Moses thought, "I will go over and
see this strange sight-why the bush
does not burn up."
4When the Lord saw that he had gone
over to look, God called to him from
within the bush, "Moses! Moses!" And
Moses said, "Here I am."
5"Do not come any closer," God said.
"Take off your sandals, for the place
where you are standing is holy ground."
6Then he said, "I am the God of your
father, the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac and the God of Jacob." At this,
Moses hid his face, because he was
afraid to look at God.
7The Lord said, "I have indeed seen the
misery of my people in Egypt. I have
heard them crying out because of their
slave drivers, and I am concerned about
their suffering.
8So I have come down to rescue them
from the hand of the Egyptians and to
bring them up out of that land into a
good and spacious land, a land flowing
with milk and honey-the home of the
Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites,
Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
9And now the cry of the Israelites has
reached me, and I have seen the way
the Egyptians are oppressing them.
10So now, go. I am sending you to
Pharaoh to bring my people the
Israelites out of Egypt."
11But Moses said to God, "Who am I,
that I should go to Pharaoh and bring
the Israelites out of Egypt?"
12And God said, "I will be with you. And
this will be the sign to you that it is I who
have sent you: When you have brought
the people out of Egypt, you will worship
God on this mountain."
13Moses said to God, "Suppose I go to
the Israelites and say to them, 'The God
of your fathers has sent me to you,' and
they ask me, 'What is his name?' Then
what shall I tell them?"
14God said to Moses, "I am who I am .
This is what you are to say to the
Israelites: 'IAM has sent me to you.' "
15God also said to Moses, "Say to the
Israelites, 'The Lord , the God of your
fathers-the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac and the God of Jacob-has sent
me to you.' This is my name forever, the
name by which I am to be remembered
from generation to generation.
16"Go, assemble the elders of Israel and
say to them, 'The Lord , the God of your
fathers-the God of Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob-appeared to me and said: I have
watched over you and have seen what
has been done to you in Egypt.
17And I have promised to bring you up
out of your misery in Egypt into the land
of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites,
Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites-a land
flowing with milk and honey.'
18"The elders of Israel will listen to you.
Then you and the elders are to go to the
king of Egypt and say to him, 'The Lord ,
the God of the Hebrews, has met with
us. Let us take a three-day journey into
the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord
our God.'
19But I know that the king of Egypt will
not let you go unless a mighty hand
compels him.
20So I will stretch out my hand and strike
the Egyptians with all the wonders that I
will perform among them. After that, he
will let you go.
21"And I will make the Egyptians
favorably disposed toward this people,
so that when you leave you will not go
empty-handed.
22Every woman is to ask her neighbor
and any woman living in her house for
articles of silver and gold and for
clothing, which you will put on your sons
and daughters. And so you will plunder
the Egyptians."
4Moses answered, "What if they do
not believe me or listen to me and say,
'The Lord did not appear to you'?"
2Then the Lord said to him, "What is that
in your hand?" "A staff," he replied.
3The Lord said, "Throw it on the
ground." Moses threw it on the ground
and it became a snake, and he ran from
it.
4Then the Lord said to him, "Reach out
your hand and take it by the tail." So
Moses reached out and took hold of the
snake and it turned back into a staff in
his hand.
5"This," said the Lord , "is so that they
may believe that the Lord , the God of
their fathers-the God of Abraham, the
God of Isaac and the God of Jacob-has
appeared to you."
6Then the Lord said, "Put your hand
inside your cloak." So Moses put his
hand into his cloak, and when he took it
out, it was leprous, like snow.
7"Now put it back into your cloak," he
said. So Moses put his hand back into
his cloak, and when he took it out, it was
restored, like the rest of his flesh.
8Then the Lord said, "If they do not
believe you or pay attention to the first
miraculous sign, they may believe the
second.
9But if they do not believe these two
signs or listen to you, take some water
from the Nile and pour it on the dry
ground. The water you take from the
river will become blood on the ground."
10Moses said to the Lord , "O Lord, I
have never been eloquent, neither in the
past nor since you have spoken to your
servant. I am slow of speech and
tongue."
11The Lord said to him, "Who gave man
his mouth? Who makes him deaf or
mute? Who gives him sight or makes
him blind? Is it not I, the Lord ?
12Now go; I will help you speak and will
teach you what to say."
13But Moses said, "O Lord, please send
someone else to do it."
14Then the Lord 's anger burned against
Moses and he said, "What about your
brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he
can speak well. He is already on his way
to meet you, and his heart will be glad
when he sees you.
15You shall speak to him and put words
in his mouth; I will help both of you
speak and will teach you what to do.
16He will speak to the people for you,
and it will be as if he were your mouth
and as if you were God to him.
17But take this staff in your hand so you
can perform miraculous signs with it."
18Then Moses went back to Jethro his
father-in-law and said to him, "Let me go
back to my own people in Egypt to see if
any of them are still alive." Jethro said,
"Go, and I wish you well."
19Now the Lord had said to Moses in
Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all the
men who wanted to kill you are dead."
20So Moses took his wife and sons, put
them on a donkey and started back to
Egypt. And he took the staff of God in
his hand.
21The Lord said to Moses, "When you
return to Egypt, see that you perform
before Pharaoh all the wonders I have
given you the power to do. But I will
harden his heart so that he will not let
the people go.
22Then say to Pharaoh, 'This is what the
Lord says: Israel is my firstborn son,
23and I told you, "Let my son go, so he
may worship me." But you refused to let
him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.' "
24At a lodging place on the way, the
Lord met [Moses] and was about to kill
him.
25But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off
her son's foreskin and touched [Moses']
feet with it. "Surely you are a
bridegroom of blood to me," she said
26So the Lord let him alone. (At that time
she said "bridegroom of blood," referring
to circumcision.)
27The Lord said to Aaron, "Go into the
desert to meet Moses." So he met
Moses at the mountain of God and
kissed him.
28Then Moses told Aaron everything the
Lord had sent him to say, and also
about all the miraculous signs he had
commanded him to perform.
29Moses and Aaron brought together all
the elders of the Israelites,
30and Aaron told them everything the
Lord had said to Moses. He also
performed the signs before the people,
31and they believed. And when they
heard that the Lord was concerned
about them and had seen their misery,
they bowed down and worshiped.
5Afterward Moses and Aaron went to
Pharaoh and said, "This is what the
Lord , the God of Israel, says: 'Let my
people go, so that they may hold a
festival to me in the desert.' "
2Pharaoh said, "Who is the Lord , that I
should obey him and let Israel go? I do
not know the Lord and I will not let Israel
go."
3Then they said, "The God of the
Hebrews has met with us. Now let us
take a three-day journey into the desert
to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God, or
he may strike us with plagues or with
the sword."
4But the king of Egypt said, "Moses and
Aaron, why are you taking the people
away from their labor? Get back to your
work!"
5Then Pharaoh said, "Look, the people
of the land are now numerous, and you
are stopping them from working."
6That same day Pharaoh gave this order
to the slave drivers and foremen in
charge of the people:
7"You are no longer to supply the people
with straw for making bricks; let them go
and gather their own straw.
8But require them to make the same
number of bricks as before; don't reduce
the quota. They are lazy; that is why
they are crying out, 'Let us go and
sacrifice to our God.'
9Make the work harder for the men so
that they keep working and pay no
attention to lies."
10Then the slave drivers and the
foremen went out and said to the people,
"This is what Pharaoh says: 'I will not
give you any more straw.
11Go and get your own straw wherever
you can find it, but your work will not be
reduced at all.' "
12So the people scattered all over Egypt
to gather stubble to use for straw.
13The slave drivers kept pressing them,
saying, "Complete the work required of
you for each day, just as when you had
straw."
14The Israelite foremen appointed by
Pharaoh's slave drivers were beaten
and were asked, "Why didn't you meet
your quota of bricks yesterday or today,
as before?"
15Then the Israelite foremen went and
appealed to Pharaoh: "Why have you
treated your servants this way?
16Your servants are given no straw, yet
we are told, 'Make bricks!' Your servants
are being beaten, but the fault is with
your own people."
17Pharaoh said, "Lazy, that's what you
are-lazy! That is why you keep saying,
'Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord .'
18Now get to work. You will not be given
any straw, yet you must produce your
full quota of bricks."
19The Israelite foremen realized they
were in trouble when they were told,
"You are not to reduce the number of
bricks required of you for each day."
20When they left Pharaoh, they found
Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,
21and they said, "May the Lord look
upon you and judge you! You have
made us a stench to Pharaoh and his
officials and have put a sword in their
hand to kill us."
22Moses returned to the Lord and said,
"O Lord, why have you brought trouble
upon this people? Is this why you sent
me?
23Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak
in your name, he has brought trouble
upon this people, and you have not
rescued your people at all."
6Then the Lord said to Moses, "Now
you will see what I will do to Pharaoh:
Because of my mighty hand he will let
them go; because of my mighty hand he
will drive them out of his country."
2God also said to Moses, "I am the Lord .
3I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to
Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name
the Lord I did not make myself known to
them.
4I also established my covenant with
them to give them the land of Canaan,
where they lived as aliens.
5Moreover, I have heard the groaning of
the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are
enslaving, and I have remembered my
covenant.
6"Therefore, say to the Israelites: 'I am
the Lord , and I will bring you out from
under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will
free you from being slaves to them, and
I will redeem you with an outstretched
arm and with mighty acts of judgment.
7I will take you as my own people, and I
will be your God. Then you will know
that I am the Lord your God, who
brought you out from under the yoke of
the Egyptians.
8And I will bring you to the land I swore
with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to
Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you
as a possession. I am the Lord .' "
9Moses reported this to the Israelites,
but they did not listen to him because of
their discouragement and cruel bondage.
10Then the Lord said to Moses,
11"Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let
the Israelites go out of his country."
12But Moses said to the Lord , "If the
Israelites will not listen to me, why would
Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with
faltering lips ?"
13Now the Lord spoke to Moses and
Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh
king of Egypt, and he commanded them
to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.
14These were the heads of their
families : The sons of Reuben the
firstborn son of Israel were Hanoch and
Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These were
the clans of Reuben.
15The sons of Simeon were Jemuel,
Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul
the son of a Canaanite woman. These
were the clans of Simeon.
16These were the names of the sons of
Levi according to their records: Gershon,
Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.
17The sons of Gershon, by clans, were
Libni and Shimei.
18The sons of Kohath were Amram,
Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived
133 years.
19The sons of Merari were Mahli and
Mushi. These were the clans of Levi
according to their records.
20Amram married his father's sister
Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and
Moses. Amram lived 137 years.
21The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg
and Zicri.
22The sons of Uzziel were Mishael,
Elzaphan and Sithri.
23Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of
Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and
she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar
and Ithamar.
24The sons of Korah were Assir,
Elkanah and Abiasaph. These were the
Korahite clans.
25Eleazar son of Aaron married one of
the daughters of Putiel, and she bore
him Phinehas. These were the heads of
the Levite families, clan by clan.
26It was this same Aaron and Moses to
whom the Lord said, "Bring the Israelites
out of Egypt by their divisions."
27They were the ones who spoke to
Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing
the Israelites out of Egypt. It was the
same Moses and Aaron.
28Now when the Lord spoke to Moses in
Egypt,
29he said to him, "I am the Lord . Tell
Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell
you."
30But Moses said to the Lord , "Since I
speak with faltering lips, why would
Pharaoh listen to me?"
7Then the Lord said to Moses, "See, I
have made you like God to Pharaoh,
and your brother Aaron will be your
prophet.
2You are to say everything I command
you, and your brother Aaron is to tell
Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his
country.
3But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and
though I multiply my miraculous signs
and wonders in Egypt,
4he will not listen to you. Then I will lay
my hand on Egypt and with mighty acts
of judgment I will bring out my divisions,
my people the Israelites.
5And the Egyptians will know that I am
the Lord when I stretch out my hand
against Egypt and bring the Israelites
out of it."
6Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord
commanded them.
7Moses was eighty years old and Aaron
eighty-three when they spoke to
Pharaoh.
8The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
9"When Pharaoh says to you, 'Perform a
miracle,' then say to Aaron, 'Take your
staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,'
and it will become a snake."
10So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh
and did just as the Lord commanded.
Aaron threw his staff down in front of
Pharaoh and his officials, and it became
a snake.
11Pharaoh then summoned wise men
and sorcerers, and the Egyptian
magicians also did the same things by
their secret arts:
12Each one threw down his staff and it
became a snake. But Aaron's staff
swallowed up their staffs.
13Yet Pharaoh's heart became hard and
he would not listen to them, just as the
Lord had said.
14Then the Lord said to Moses,
"Pharaoh's heart is unyielding; he
refuses to let the people go.
15Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he
goes out to the water. Wait on the bank
of the Nile to meet him, and take in your
hand the staff that was changed into a
snake.
16Then say to him, 'The Lord , the God
of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to
you: Let my people go, so that they may
worship me in the desert. But until now
you have not listened.
17This is what the Lord says: By this you
will know that I am the Lord : With the
staff that is in my hand I will strike the
water of the Nile, and it will be changed
into blood.
18The fish in the Nile will die, and the
river will stink; the Egyptians will not be
able to drink its water.' "
19The Lord said to Moses, "Tell Aaron,
'Take your staff and stretch out your
hand over the waters of Egypt-over the
streams and canals, over the ponds and
all the reservoirs'-and they will turn to
blood. Blood will be everywhere in Egypt,
even in the wooden buckets and stone
jars."
20Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord
had commanded. He raised his staff in
the presence of Pharaoh and his
officials and struck the water of the Nile,
and all the water was changed into
blood.
21The fish in the Nile died, and the river
smelled so bad that the Egyptians could
not drink its water. Blood was
everywhere in Egypt.
22But the Egyptian magicians did the
same things by their secret arts, and
Pharaoh's heart became hard; he would
not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as
the Lord had said.
23Instead, he turned and went into his
palace, and did not take even this to
heart.
24And all the Egyptians dug along the
Nile to get drinking water, because they
could not drink the water of the river.
25Seven days passed after the Lord
struck the Nile.
8Then the Lord said to Moses, "Go to
Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what
the Lord says: Let my people go, so that
they may worship me.
2If you refuse to let them go, I will plague
your whole country with frogs.
3The Nile will teem with frogs. They will
come up into your palace and your
bedroom and onto your bed, into the
houses of your officials and on your
people, and into your ovens and
kneading troughs.
4The frogs will go up on you and your
people and all your officials.' "
5Then the Lord said to Moses, "Tell
Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your
staff over the streams and canals and
ponds, and make frogs come up on the
land of Egypt.' "
6So Aaron stretched out his hand over
the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came
up and covered the land.
7But the magicians did the same things
by their secret arts; they also made
frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
8Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron
and said, "Pray to the Lord to take the
frogs away from me and my people, and
I will let your people go to offer
sacrifices to the Lord ."
9Moses said to Pharaoh, "I leave to you
the honor of setting the time for me to
pray for you and your officials and your
people that you and your houses may
be rid of the frogs, except for those that
remain in the Nile."
10"Tomorrow," Pharaoh said. Moses
replied, "It will be as you say, so that
you may know there is no one like the
Lord our God.
11The frogs will leave you and your
houses, your officials and your people;
they will remain only in the Nile."
12After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh,
Moses cried out to the Lord about the
frogs he had brought on Pharaoh.
13And the Lord did what Moses asked.
The frogs died in the houses, in the
courtyards and in the fields.
14They were piled into heaps, and the
land reeked of them.
15But when Pharaoh saw that there was
relief, he hardened his heart and would
not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as
the Lord had said.
16Then the Lord said to Moses, "Tell
Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike
the dust of the ground,' and throughout
the land of Egypt the dust will become
gnats."
17They did this, and when Aaron
stretched out his hand with the staff and
struck the dust of the ground, gnats
came upon men and animals. All the
dust throughout the land of Egypt
became gnats.
18But when the magicians tried to
produce gnats by their secret arts, they
could not. And the gnats were on men
and animals.
19The magicians said to Pharaoh, "This
is the finger of God." But Pharaoh's
heart was hard and he would not listen,
just as the Lord had said.
20Then the Lord said to Moses, "Get up
early in the morning and confront
Pharaoh as he goes to the water and
say to him, 'This is what the Lord says:
Let my people go, so that they may
worship me.
21If you do not let my people go, I will
send swarms of flies on you and your
officials, on your people and into your
houses. The houses of the Egyptians
will be full of flies, and even the ground
where they are.
22" 'But on that day I will deal differently
with the land of Goshen, where my
people live; no swarms of flies will be
there, so that you will know that I, the
Lord , am in this land.
23I will make a distinction between my
people and your people. This
miraculous sign will occur tomorrow.' "
24And the Lord did this. Dense swarms
of flies poured into Pharaoh's palace
and into the houses of his officials, and
throughout Egypt the land was ruined by
the flies.
25Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and
Aaron and said, "Go, sacrifice to your
God here in the land."
26But Moses said, "That would not be
right. The sacrifices we offer the Lord
our God would be detestable to the
Egyptians. And if we offer sacrifices that
are detestable in their eyes, will they not
stone us?
27We must take a three-day journey into
the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord
our God, as he commands us."
28Pharaoh said, "I will let you go to offer
sacrifices to the Lord your God in the
desert, but you must not go very far.
Now pray for me."
29Moses answered, "As soon as I leave
you, I will pray to the Lord , and
tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh
and his officials and his people. Only be
sure that Pharaoh does not act
deceitfully again by not letting the
people go to offer sacrifices to the
Lord ."
30Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed
to the Lord ,
31and the Lord did what Moses asked:
The flies left Pharaoh and his officials
and his people; not a fly remained.
32But this time also Pharaoh hardened
his heart and would not let the people
go.
9Then the Lord said to Moses, "Go to
Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what
the Lord , the God of the Hebrews, says:
"Let my people go, so that they may
worship me."
2If you refuse to let them go and
continue to hold them back,
3the hand of the Lord will bring a terrible
plague on your livestock in the field-on
your horses and donkeys and camels
and on your cattle and sheep and goats.
4But the Lord will make a distinction
between the livestock of Israel and that
of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to
the Israelites will die.' "
5The Lord set a time and said,
"Tomorrow the Lord will do this in the
land."
6And the next day the Lord did it: All the
livestock of the Egyptians died, but not
one animal belonging to the Israelites
died.
7Pharaoh sent men to investigate and
found that not even one of the animals
of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart
was unyielding and he would not let the
people go.
8Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
"Take handfuls of soot from a furnace
and have Moses toss it into the air in the
presence of Pharaoh.
9It will become fine dust over the whole
land of Egypt, and festering boils will
break out on men and animals
throughout the land."
10So they took soot from a furnace and
stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it
into the air, and festering boils broke out
on men and animals.
11The magicians could not stand before
Moses because of the boils that were on
them and on all the Egyptians.
12But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart
and he would not listen to Moses and
Aaron, just as the Lord had said to
Moses.
13Then the Lord said to Moses, "Get up
early in the morning, confront Pharaoh
and say to him, 'This is what the Lord ,
the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my
people go, so that they may worship me,
14or this time I will send the full force of
my plagues against you and against
your officials and your people, so you
may know that there is no one like me in
all the earth.
15For by now I could have stretched out
my hand and struck you and your
people with a plague that would have
wiped you off the earth.
16But I have raised you up for this very
purpose, that I might show you my
power and that my name might be
proclaimed in all the earth.
17You still set yourself against my
people and will not let them go.
18Therefore, at this time tomorrow I will
send the worst hailstorm that has ever
fallen on Egypt, from the day it was
founded till now.
19Give an order now to bring your
livestock and everything you have in the
field to a place of shelter, because the
hail will fall on every man and animal
that has not been brought in and is still
out in the field, and they will die.' "
20Those officials of Pharaoh who feared
the word of the Lord hurried to bring
their slaves and their livestock inside.
21But those who ignored the word of the
Lord left their slaves and livestock in the
field.
22Then the Lord said to Moses, "Stretch
out your hand toward the sky so that hail
will fall all over Egypt-on men and
animals and on everything growing in
the fields of Egypt."
23When Moses stretched out his staff
toward the sky, the Lord sent thunder
and hail, and lightning flashed down to
the ground. So the Lord rained hail on
the land of Egypt;
24hail fell and lightning flashed back and
forth. It was the worst storm in all the
land of Egypt since it had become a
nation.
25Throughout Egypt hail struck
everything in the fields-both men and
animals; it beat down everything
growing in the fields and stripped every
tree.
26The only place it did not hail was the
land of Goshen, where the Israelites
were.
27Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and
Aaron. "This time I have sinned," he said
to them. "The Lord is in the right, and I
and my people are in the wrong.
28Pray to the Lord , for we have had
enough thunder and hail. I will let you
go; you don't have to stay any longer."
29Moses replied, "When I have gone out
of the city, I will spread out my hands in
prayer to the Lord . The thunder will stop
and there will be no more hail, so you
may know that the earth is the Lord 's.
30But I know that you and your officials
still do not fear the Lord God."
31(The flax and barley were destroyed,
since the barley had headed and the
flax was in bloom.
32The wheat and spelt, however, were
not destroyed, because they ripen later.)
33Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out
of the city. He spread out his hands
toward the Lord ; the thunder and hail
stopped, and the rain no longer poured
down on the land.
34When Pharaoh saw that the rain and
hail and thunder had stopped, he sinned
again: He and his officials hardened
their hearts.
35So Pharaoh's heart was hard and he
would not let the Israelites go, just as
the Lord had said through Moses.
10Then the Lord said to Moses, "Go
to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his
heart and the hearts of his officials so
that I may perform these miraculous
signs of mine among them
2that you may tell your children and
grandchildren how I dealt harshly with
the Egyptians and how I performed my
signs among them, and that you may
know that I am the Lord ."
3So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh
and said to him, "This is what the Lord ,
the God of the Hebrews, says: 'How
long will you refuse to humble yourself
before me? Let my people go, so that
they may worship me.
4If you refuse to let them go, I will bring
locusts into your country tomorrow.
5They will cover the face of the ground
so that it cannot be seen. They will
devour what little you have left after the
hail, including every tree that is growing
in your fields.
6They will fill your houses and those of
all your officials and all the Egyptianssomething
neither your fathers nor your
forefathers have ever seen from the day
they settled in this land till now.' " Then
Moses turned and left Pharaoh.
7Pharaoh's officials said to him, "How
long will this man be a snare to us? Let
the people go, so that they may worship
the Lord their God. Do you not yet
realize that Egypt is ruined?"
8Then Moses and Aaron were brought
back to Pharaoh. "Go, worship the Lord
your God," he said. "But just who will be
going?"
9Moses answered, "We will go with our
young and old, with our sons and
daughters, and with our flocks and
herds, because we are to celebrate a
festival to the Lord ."
10Pharaoh said, "The Lord be with you-if
I let you go, along with your women and
children! Clearly you are bent on evil.
11No! Have only the men go; and
worship the Lord , since that's what you
have been asking for." Then Moses and
Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh's
presence.
12And the Lord said to Moses, "Stretch
out your hand over Egypt so that locusts
will swarm over the land and devour
everything growing in the fields,
everything left by the hail."
13So Moses stretched out his staff over
Egypt, and the Lord made an east wind
blow across the land all that day and all
that night. By morning the wind had
brought the locusts;
14they invaded all Egypt and settled
down in every area of the country in
great numbers. Never before had there
been such a plague of locusts, nor will
there ever be again.
15They covered all the ground until it
was black. They devoured all that was
left after the hail-everything growing in
the fields and the fruit on the trees.
Nothing green remained on tree or plant
in all the land of Egypt.
16Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses
and Aaron and said, "I have sinned
against the Lord your God and against
you.
17Now forgive my sin once more and
pray to the Lord your God to take this
deadly plague away from me."
18Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to
the Lord .
19And the Lord changed the wind to a
very strong west wind, which caught up
the locusts and carried them into the
Red Sea. Not a locust was left
anywhere in Egypt.
20But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart,
and he would not let the Israelites go.
21Then the Lord said to Moses, "Stretch
out your hand toward the sky so that
darkness will spread over Egyptdarkness
that can be felt."
22So Moses stretched out his hand
toward the sky, and total darkness
covered all Egypt for three days.
23No one could see anyone else or
leave his place for three days. Yet all
the Israelites had light in the places
where they lived.
24Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and
said, "Go, worship the Lord . Even your
women and children may go with you;
only leave your flocks and herds
behind."
25But Moses said, "You must allow us to
have sacrifices and burnt offerings to
present to the Lord our God.
26Our livestock too must go with us; not
a hoof is to be left behind. We have to
use some of them in worshiping the
Lord our God, and until we get there we
will not know what we are to use to
worship the Lord ."
27But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart,
and he was not willing to let them go.
28Pharaoh said to Moses, "Get out of my
sight! Make sure you do not appear
before me again! The day you see my
face you will die."
29"Just as you say," Moses replied, "I will
never appear before you again."
11Now the Lord had said to Moses,
"I will bring one more plague on
Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will
let you go from here, and when he does,
he will drive you out completely.
2Tell the people that men and women
alike are to ask their neighbors for
articles of silver and gold."
3(The Lord made the Egyptians
favorably disposed toward the people,
and Moses himself was highly regarded
in Egypt by Pharaoh's officials and by
the people.)
4So Moses said, "This is what the Lord
says: 'About midnight I will go
throughout Egypt.
5Every firstborn son in Egypt will die,
from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who
sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of
the slave girl, who is at her hand mill,
and all the firstborn of the cattle as well.
6There will be loud wailing throughout
Egypt-worse than there has ever been
or ever will be again.
7But among the Israelites not a dog will
bark at any man or animal.' Then you
will know that the Lord makes a
distinction between Egypt and Israel.
8All these officials of yours will come to
me, bowing down before me and saying,
'Go, you and all the people who follow
you!' After that I will leave." Then Moses,
hot with anger, left Pharaoh.
9The Lord had said to Moses, "Pharaoh
will refuse to listen to you-so that my
wonders may be multiplied in Egypt."
10Moses and Aaron performed all these
wonders before Pharaoh, but the Lord
hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he
would not let the Israelites go out of his
country.
12The Lord said to Moses and
Aaron in Egypt,
2"This month is to be for you the first
month, the first month of your year.
3Tell the whole community of Israel that
on the tenth day of this month each man
is to take a lamb for his family, one for
each household.
4If any household is too small for a
whole lamb, they must share one with
their nearest neighbor, having taken into
account the number of people there are.
You are to determine the amount of
lamb needed in accordance with what
each person will eat.
5The animals you choose must be yearold
males without defect, and you may
take them from the sheep or the goats.
6Take care of them until the fourteenth
day of the month, when all the people of
the community of Israel must slaughter
them at twilight.
7Then they are to take some of the
blood and put it on the sides and tops of
the doorframes of the houses where
they eat the lambs.
8That same night they are to eat the
meat roasted over the fire, along with
bitter herbs, and bread made without
yeast.
9Do not eat the meat raw or cooked in
water, but roast it over the fire-head,
legs and inner parts.
10Do not leave any of it till morning; if
some is left till morning, you must burn it.
11This is how you are to eat it: with your
cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals
on your feet and your staff in your hand.
Eat it in haste; it is the Lord 's Passover.
12"On that same night I will pass through
Egypt and strike down every firstbornboth
men and animals-and I will bring
judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am
the Lord .
13The blood will be a sign for you on the
houses where you are; and when I see
the blood, I will pass over you. No
destructive plague will touch you when I
strike Egypt.
14"This is a day you are to
commemorate; for the generations to
come you shall celebrate it as a festival
to the Lord -a lasting ordinance.
15For seven days you are to eat bread
made without yeast. On the first day
remove the yeast from your houses, for
whoever eats anything with yeast in it
from the first day through the seventh
must be cut off from Israel.
16On the first day hold a sacred
assembly, and another one on the
seventh day. Do no work at all on these
days, except to prepare food for
everyone to eat-that is all you may do.
17"Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened
Bread, because it was on this very day
that I brought your divisions out of Egypt.
Celebrate this day as a lasting
ordinance for the generations to come.
18In the first month you are to eat bread
made without yeast, from the evening of
the fourteenth day until the evening of
the twenty-first day.
19For seven days no yeast is to be found
in your houses. And whoever eats
anything with yeast in it must be cut off
from the community of Israel, whether
he is an alien or native-born.
20Eat nothing made with yeast.
Wherever you live, you must eat
unleavened bread."
21Then Moses summoned all the elders
of Israel and said to them, "Go at once
and select the animals for your families
and slaughter the Passover lamb.
22Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the
blood in the basin and put some of the
blood on the top and on both sides of
the doorframe. Not one of you shall go
out the door of his house until morning.
23When the Lord goes through the land
to strike down the Egyptians, he will see
the blood on the top and sides of the
doorframe and will pass over that
doorway, and he will not permit the
destroyer to enter your houses and
strike you down.
24"Obey these instructions as a lasting
ordinance for you and your descendants.
25When you enter the land that the Lord
will give you as he promised, observe
this ceremony.
26And when your children ask you, 'What
does this ceremony mean to you?'
27then tell them, 'It is the Passover
sacrifice to the Lord , who passed over
the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and
spared our homes when he struck down
the Egyptians.' " Then the people bowed
down and worshiped.
28The Israelites did just what the Lord
commanded Moses and Aaron.
29At midnight the Lord struck down all
the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn
of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to
the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in
the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the
livestock as well.
30Pharaoh and all his officials and all the
Egyptians got up during the night, and
there was loud wailing in Egypt, for
there was not a house without someone
dead.
31During the night Pharaoh summoned
Moses and Aaron and said, "Up! Leave
my people, you and the Israelites! Go,
worship the Lord as you have requested.
32Take your flocks and herds, as you
have said, and go. And also bless me."
33The Egyptians urged the people to
hurry and leave the country. "For
otherwise," they said, "we will all die!"
34So the people took their dough before
the yeast was added, and carried it on
their shoulders in kneading troughs
wrapped in clothing.
35The Israelites did as Moses instructed
and asked the Egyptians for articles of
silver and gold and for clothing.
36The Lord had made the Egyptians
favorably disposed toward the people,
and they gave them what they asked
for; so they plundered the Egyptians.
37The Israelites journeyed from
Rameses to Succoth. There were about
six hundred thousand men on foot,
besides women and children.
38Many other people went up with them,
as well as large droves of livestock, both
flocks and herds.
39With the dough they had brought from
Egypt, they baked cakes of unleavened
bread. The dough was without yeast
because they had been driven out of
Egypt and did not have time to prepare
food for themselves.
40Now the length of time the Israelite
people lived in Egypt was 430 years.
41At the end of the 430 years, to the very
day, all the Lord 's divisions left Egypt.
42Because the Lord kept vigil that night
to bring them out of Egypt, on this night
all the Israelites are to keep vigil to
honor the Lord for the generations to
come.
43The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
"These are the regulations for the
Passover: "No foreigner is to eat of it.
44Any slave you have bought may eat of
it after you have circumcised him,
45but a temporary resident and a hired
worker may not eat of it.
46"It must be eaten inside one house;
take none of the meat outside the house.
Do not break any of the bones.
47The whole community of Israel must
celebrate it.
48"An alien living among you who wants
to celebrate the Lord 's Passover must
have all the males in his household
circumcised; then he may take part like
one born in the land. No uncircumcised
male may eat of it.
49The same law applies to the nativeborn
and to the alien living among you."
50All the Israelites did just what the Lord
had commanded Moses and Aaron.
51And on that very day the Lord brought
the Israelites out of Egypt by their
divisions.
13The Lord said to Moses,
2"Consecrate to me every firstborn male.
The first offspring of every womb among
the Israelites belongs to me, whether
man or animal."
3Then Moses said to the people,
"Commemorate this day, the day you
came out of Egypt, out of the land of
slavery, because the Lord brought you
out of it with a mighty hand. Eat nothing
containing yeast.
4Today, in the month of Abib, you are
leaving.
5When the Lord brings you into the land
of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites,
Hivites and Jebusites-the land he swore
to your forefathers to give you, a land
flowing with milk and honey-you are to
observe this ceremony in this month:
6For seven days eat bread made without
yeast and on the seventh day hold a
festival to the Lord .
7Eat unleavened bread during those
seven days; nothing with yeast in it is to
be seen among you, nor shall any yeast
be seen anywhere within your borders.
8On that day tell your son, 'I do this
because of what the Lord did for me
when I came out of Egypt.'
9This observance will be for you like a
sign on your hand and a reminder on
your forehead that the law of the Lord is
to be on your lips. For the Lord brought
you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.
10You must keep this ordinance at the
appointed time year after year.
11"After the Lord brings you into the land
of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as
he promised on oath to you and your
forefathers,
12you are to give over to the Lord the
first offspring of every womb. All the
firstborn males of your livestock belong
to the Lord .
13Redeem with a lamb every firstborn
donkey, but if you do not redeem it,
break its neck. Redeem every firstborn
among your sons.
14"In days to come, when your son asks
you, 'What does this mean?' say to him,
'With a mighty hand the Lord brought us
out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
15When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to
let us go, the Lord killed every firstborn
in Egypt, both man and animal. This is
why I sacrifice to the Lord the first male
offspring of every womb and redeem
each of my firstborn sons.'
16And it will be like a sign on your hand
and a symbol on your forehead that the
Lord brought us out of Egypt with his
mighty hand."
17When Pharaoh let the people go, God
did not lead them on the road through
the Philistine country, though that was
shorter. For God said, "If they face war,
they might change their minds and
return to Egypt."
18So God led the people around by the
desert road toward the Red Sea. The
Israelites went up out of Egypt armed for
battle.
19Moses took the bones of Joseph with
him because Joseph had made the sons
of Israel swear an oath. He had said,
"God will surely come to your aid, and
then you must carry my bones up with
you from this place."
20After leaving Succoth they camped at
Etham on the edge of the desert.
21By day the Lord went ahead of them in
a pillar of cloud to guide them on their
way and by night in a pillar of fire to give
them light, so that they could travel by
day or night.
22Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor
the pillar of fire by night left its place in
front of the people.
14Then the Lord said to Moses,
2"Tell the Israelites to turn back and
encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between
Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp
by the sea, directly opposite Baal
Zephon.
3Pharaoh will think, 'The Israelites are
wandering around the land in confusion,
hemmed in by the desert.'
4And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and
he will pursue them. But I will gain glory
for myself through Pharaoh and all his
army, and the Egyptians will know that I
am the Lord ." So the Israelites did this.
5When the king of Egypt was told that
the people had fled, Pharaoh and his
officials changed their minds about them
and said, "What have we done? We
have let the Israelites go and have lost
their services!"
6So he had his chariot made ready and
took his army with him.
7He took six hundred of the best chariots,
along with all the other chariots of Egypt,
with officers over all of them.
8The Lord hardened the heart of
Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he
pursued the Israelites, who were
marching out boldly.
9The Egyptians-all Pharaoh's horses
and chariots, horsemen and troopspursued
the Israelites and overtook
them as they camped by the sea near Pi
Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon.
10As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites
looked up, and there were the Egyptians,
marching after them. They were terrified
and cried out to the Lord .
11They said to Moses, "Was it because
there were no graves in Egypt that you
brought us to the desert to die? What
have you done to us by bringing us out
of Egypt?
12Didn't we say to you in Egypt, 'Leave
us alone; let us serve the Egyptians'? It
would have been better for us to serve
the Egyptians than to die in the desert!"
13Moses answered the people, "Do not
be afraid. Stand firm and you will see
the deliverance the Lord will bring you
today. The Egyptians you see today you
will never see again.
14The Lord will fight for you; you need
only to be still."
15Then the Lord said to Moses, "Why
are you crying out to me? Tell the
Israelites to move on.
16Raise your staff and stretch out your
hand over the sea to divide the water so
that the Israelites can go through the
sea on dry ground.
17I will harden the hearts of the
Egyptians so that they will go in after
them. And I will gain glory through
Pharaoh and all his army, through his
chariots and his horsemen.
18The Egyptians will know that I am the
Lord when I gain glory through Pharaoh,
his chariots and his horsemen."
19Then the angel of God, who had been
traveling in front of Israel's army,
withdrew and went behind them. The
pillar of cloud also moved from in front
and stood behind them,
20coming between the armies of Egypt
and Israel. Throughout the night the
cloud brought darkness to the one side
and light to the other side; so neither
went near the other all night long.
21Then Moses stretched out his hand
over the sea, and all that night the Lord
drove the sea back with a strong east
wind and turned it into dry land. The
waters were divided,
22and the Israelites went through the sea
on dry ground, with a wall of water on
their right and on their left.
23The Egyptians pursued them, and all
Pharaoh's horses and chariots and
horsemen followed them into the sea.
24During the last watch of the night the
Lord looked down from the pillar of fire
and cloud at the Egyptian army and
threw it into confusion.
25He made the wheels of their chariots
come off so that they had difficulty
driving. And the Egyptians said, "Let's
get away from the Israelites! The Lord is
fighting for them against Egypt."
26Then the Lord said to Moses, "Stretch
out your hand over the sea so that the
waters may flow back over the
Egyptians and their chariots and
horsemen."
27Moses stretched out his hand over the
sea, and at daybreak the sea went back
to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing
toward it, and the Lord swept them into
the sea.
28The water flowed back and covered
the chariots and horsemen-the entire
army of Pharaoh that had followed the
Israelites into the sea. Not one of them
survived.
29But the Israelites went through the sea
on dry ground, with a wall of water on
their right and on their left.
30That day the Lord saved Israel from
the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel
saw the Egyptians lying dead on the
shore.
31And when the Israelites saw the great
power the Lord displayed against the
Egyptians, the people feared the Lord
and put their trust in him and in Moses
his servant.
15Then Moses and the Israelites
sang this song to the Lord : "I will sing to
the Lord , for he is highly exalted. The
horse and its rider he has hurled into the
sea.
2The Lord is my strength and my song;
he has become my salvation. He is my
God, and I will praise him, my father's
God, and I will exalt him.
3The Lord is a warrior; the Lord is his
name.
4Pharaoh's chariots and his army he has
hurled into the sea. The best of
Pharaoh's officers are drowned in the
Red Sea.
5The deep waters have covered them;
they sank to the depths like a stone.
6"Your right hand, O Lord , was majestic
in power. Your right hand, O Lord ,
shattered the enemy.
7In the greatness of your majesty you
threw down those who opposed you.
You unleashed your burning anger; it
consumed them like stubble.
8By the blast of your nostrils the waters
piled up. The surging waters stood firm
like a wall; the deep waters congealed in
the heart of the sea.
9"The enemy boasted, 'I will pursue, I
will overtake them. I will divide the
spoils; I will gorge myself on them. I will
draw my sword and my hand will
destroy them.'
10But you blew with your breath, and the
sea covered them. They sank like lead
in the mighty waters.
11"Who among the gods is like you, O
Lord ? Who is like you- majestic in
holiness, awesome in glory, working
wonders?
12You stretched out your right hand and
the earth swallowed them.
13"In your unfailing love you will lead the
people you have redeemed. In your
strength you will guide them to your holy
dwelling.
14The nations will hear and tremble;
anguish will grip the people of Philistia.
15The chiefs of Edom will be terrified, the
leaders of Moab will be seized with
trembling, the people of Canaan will
melt away;
16terror and dread will fall upon them. By
the power of your arm they will be as
still as a stone- until your people pass
by, O Lord , until the people you bought
pass by.
17You will bring them in and plant them
on the mountain of your inheritance- the
place, O Lord , you made for your
dwelling, the sanctuary, O Lord, your
hands established.
18The Lord will reign for ever and ever."
19When Pharaoh's horses, chariots and
horsemen went into the sea, the Lord
brought the waters of the sea back over
them, but the Israelites walked through
the sea on dry ground.
20Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's
sister, took a tambourine in her hand,
and all the women followed her, with
tambourines and dancing.
21Miriam sang to them: "Sing to the
Lord , for he is highly exalted. The horse
and its rider he has hurled into the sea."
22Then Moses led Israel from the Red
Sea and they went into the Desert of
Shur. For three days they traveled in the
desert without finding water.
23When they came to Marah, they could
not drink its water because it was bitter.
(That is why the place is called Marah. )
24So the people grumbled against
Moses, saying, "What are we to drink?"
25Then Moses cried out to the Lord , and
the Lord showed him a piece of wood.
He threw it into the water, and the water
became sweet. There the Lord made a
decree and a law for them, and there he
tested them.
26He said, "If you listen carefully to the
voice of the Lord your God and do what
is right in his eyes, if you pay attention
to his commands and keep all his
decrees, I will not bring on you any of
the diseases I brought on the Egyptians,
for I am the Lord , who heals you."
27Then they came to Elim, where there
were twelve springs and seventy palm
trees, and they camped there near the
water.
16The whole Israelite community set
out from Elim and came to the Desert of
Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on
the fifteenth day of the second month
after they had come out of Egypt.
2In the desert the whole community
grumbled against Moses and Aaron.
3The Israelites said to them, "If only we
had died by the Lord 's hand in Egypt!
There we sat around pots of meat and
ate all the food we wanted, but you have
brought us out into this desert to starve
this entire assembly to death."
4Then the Lord said to Moses, "I will rain
down bread from heaven for you. The
people are to go out each day and
gather enough for that day. In this way I
will test them and see whether they will
follow my instructions.
5On the sixth day they are to prepare
what they bring in, and that is to be
twice as much as they gather on the
other days."
6So Moses and Aaron said to all the
Israelites, "In the evening you will know
that it was the Lord who brought you out
of Egypt,
7and in the morning you will see the
glory of the Lord , because he has heard
your grumbling against him. Who are we,
that you should grumble against us?"
8Moses also said, "You will know that it
was the Lord when he gives you meat to
eat in the evening and all the bread you
want in the morning, because he has
heard your grumbling against him. Who
are we? You are not grumbling against
us, but against the Lord ."
9Then Moses told Aaron, "Say to the
entire Israelite community, 'Come before
the Lord , for he has heard your
grumbling.' "
10While Aaron was speaking to the
whole Israelite community, they looked
toward the desert, and there was the
glory of the Lord appearing in the cloud.
11The Lord said to Moses,
12"I have heard the grumbling of the
Israelites. Tell them, 'At twilight you will
eat meat, and in the morning you will be
filled with bread. Then you will know that
I am the Lord your God.' "
13That evening quail came and covered
the camp, and in the morning there was
a layer of dew around the camp.
14When the dew was gone, thin flakes
like frost on the ground appeared on the
desert floor.
15When the Israelites saw it, they said to
each other, "What is it?" For they did not
know what it was. Moses said to them,
"It is the bread the Lord has given you to
eat.
16This is what the Lord has commanded:
'Each one is to gather as much as he
needs. Take an omer for each person
you have in your tent.' "
17The Israelites did as they were told;
some gathered much, some little.
18And when they measured it by the
omer, he who gathered much did not
have too much, and he who gathered
little did not have too little. Each one
gathered as much as he needed.
19Then Moses said to them, "No one is
to keep any of it until morning."
20However, some of them paid no
attention to Moses; they kept part of it
until morning, but it was full of maggots
and began to smell. So Moses was
angry with them.
21Each morning everyone gathered as
much as he needed, and when the sun
grew hot, it melted away.
22On the sixth day, they gathered twice
as much-two omers for each person-and
the leaders of the community came and
reported this to Moses.
23He said to them, "This is what the Lord
commanded: 'Tomorrow is to be a day
of rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord . So
bake what you want to bake and boil
what you want to boil. Save whatever is
left and keep it until morning.' "
24So they saved it until morning, as
Moses commanded, and it did not stink
or get maggots in it.
25"Eat it today," Moses said, "because
today is a Sabbath to the Lord . You will
not find any of it on the ground today.
26Six days you are to gather it, but on
the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will
not be any."
27Nevertheless, some of the people
went out on the seventh day to gather it,
but they found none.
28Then the Lord said to Moses, "How
long will you refuse to keep my
commands and my instructions?
29Bear in mind that the Lord has given
you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth
day he gives you bread for two days.
Everyone is to stay where he is on the
seventh day; no one is to go out."
30So the people rested on the seventh
day.
31The people of Israel called the bread
manna. It was white like coriander seed
and tasted like wafers made with honey.
32Moses said, "This is what the Lord has
commanded: 'Take an omer of manna
and keep it for the generations to come,
so they can see the bread I gave you to
eat in the desert when I brought you out
of Egypt.' "
33So Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar
and put an omer of manna in it. Then
place it before the Lord to be kept for
the generations to come."
34As the Lord commanded Moses,
Aaron put the manna in front of the
Testimony, that it might be kept.
35The Israelites ate manna forty years,
until they came to a land that was
settled; they ate manna until they
reached the border of Canaan.
36(An omer is one tenth of an ephah.)
17The whole Israelite community set
out from the Desert of Sin, traveling
from place to place as the Lord
commanded. They camped at Rephidim,
but there was no water for the people to
drink.
2So they quarreled with Moses and said,
"Give us water to drink." Moses replied,
"Why do you quarrel with me? Why do
you put the Lord to the test?"
3But the people were thirsty for water
there, and they grumbled against Moses.
They said, "Why did you bring us up out
of Egypt to make us and our children
and livestock die of thirst?"
4Then Moses cried out to the Lord ,
"What am I to do with these people?
They are almost ready to stone me."
5The Lord answered Moses, "Walk on
ahead of the people. Take with you
some of the elders of Israel and take in
your hand the staff with which you
struck the Nile, and go.
6I will stand there before you by the rock
at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will
come out of it for the people to drink."
So Moses did this in the sight of the
elders of Israel.
7And he called the place Massah and
Meribah because the Israelites
quarreled and because they tested the
Lord saying, "Is the Lord among us or
not?"
8The Amalekites came and attacked the
Israelites at Rephidim.
9Moses said to Joshua, "Choose some
of our men and go out to fight the
Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top
of the hill with the staff of God in my
hands."
10So Joshua fought the Amalekites as
Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron
and Hur went to the top of the hill.
11As long as Moses held up his hands,
the Israelites were winning, but
whenever he lowered his hands, the
Amalekites were winning.
12When Moses' hands grew tired, they
took a stone and put it under him and he
sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands
up-one on one side, one on the other-so
that his hands remained steady till
sunset.
13So Joshua overcame the Amalekite
army with the sword.
14Then the Lord said to Moses, "Write
this on a scroll as something to be
remembered and make sure that
Joshua hears it, because I will
completely blot out the memory of
Amalek from under heaven."
15Moses built an altar and called it The
Lord is my Banner.
16He said, "For hands were lifted up to
the throne of the Lord . The Lord will be
at war against the Amalekites from
generation to generation."
18Now Jethro, the priest of Midian
and father-in-law of Moses, heard of
everything God had done for Moses and
for his people Israel, and how the Lord
had brought Israel out of Egypt.
2After Moses had sent away his wife
Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro
received her
3and her two sons. One son was named
Gershom, for Moses said, "I have
become an alien in a foreign land";
4and the other was named Eliezer, for
he said, "My father's God was my
helper; he saved me from the sword of
Pharaoh."
5Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, together
with Moses' sons and wife, came to him
in the desert, where he was camped
near the mountain of God.
6Jethro had sent word to him, "I, your
father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you
with your wife and her two sons."
7So Moses went out to meet his fatherin-
law and bowed down and kissed him.
They greeted each other and then went
into the tent.
8Moses told his father-in-law about
everything the Lord had done to
Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's
sake and about all the hardships they
had met along the way and how the
Lord had saved them.
9Jethro was delighted to hear about all
the good things the Lord had done for
Israel in rescuing them from the hand of
the Egyptians.
10He said, "Praise be to the Lord , who
rescued you from the hand of the
Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who
rescued the people from the hand of the
Egyptians.
11Now I know that the Lord is greater
than all other gods, for he did this to
those who had treated Israel arrogantly."
12Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law,
brought a burnt offering and other
sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with
all the elders of Israel to eat bread with
Moses' father-in-law in the presence of
God.
13The next day Moses took his seat to
serve as judge for the people, and they
stood around him from morning till
evening.
14When his father-in-law saw all that
Moses was doing for the people, he said,
"What is this you are doing for the
people? Why do you alone sit as judge,
while all these people stand around you
from morning till evening?"
15Moses answered him, "Because the
people come to me to seek God's will.
16Whenever they have a dispute, it is
brought to me, and I decide between the
parties and inform them of God's
decrees and laws."
17Moses' father-in-law replied, "What
you are doing is not good.
18You and these people who come to
you will only wear yourselves out. The
work is too heavy for you; you cannot
handle it alone.
19Listen now to me and I will give you
some advice, and may God be with you.
You must be the people's representative
before God and bring their disputes to
him.
20Teach them the decrees and laws, and
show them the way to live and the
duties they are to perform.
21But select capable men from all the
people-men who fear God, trustworthy
men who hate dishonest gain-and
appoint them as officials over thousands,
hundreds, fifties and tens.
22Have them serve as judges for the
people at all times, but have them bring
every difficult case to you; the simple
cases they can decide themselves. That
will make your load lighter, because
they will share it with you.
23If you do this and God so commands,
you will be able to stand the strain, and
all these people will go home satisfied."
24Moses listened to his father-in-law and
did everything he said.
25He chose capable men from all Israel
and made them leaders of the people,
officials over thousands, hundreds,
fifties and tens.
26They served as judges for the people
at all times. The difficult cases they
brought to Moses, but the simple ones
they decided themselves.
27Then Moses sent his father-in-law on
his way, and Jethro returned to his own
country.
19In the third month after the
Israelites left Egypt-on the very day-they
came to the Desert of Sinai.
2After they set out from Rephidim, they
entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel
camped there in the desert in front of
the mountain.
3Then Moses went up to God, and the
Lord called to him from the mountain
and said, "This is what you are to say to
the house of Jacob and what you are to
tell the people of Israel:
4'You yourselves have seen what I did to
Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles'
wings and brought you to myself.
5Now if you obey me fully and keep my
covenant, then out of all nations you will
be my treasured possession. Although
the whole earth is mine,
6you will be for me a kingdom of priests
and a holy nation.' These are the words
you are to speak to the Israelites."
7So Moses went back and summoned
the elders of the people and set before
them all the words the Lord had
commanded him to speak.
8The people all responded together,
"We will do everything the Lord has
said." So Moses brought their answer
back to the Lord .
9The Lord said to Moses, "I am going to
come to you in a dense cloud, so that
the people will hear me speaking with
you and will always put their trust in
you." Then Moses told the Lord what the
people had said.
10And the Lord said to Moses, "Go to the
people and consecrate them today and
tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes
11and be ready by the third day,
because on that day the Lord will come
down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all
the people.
12Put limits for the people around the
mountain and tell them, 'Be careful that
you do not go up the mountain or touch
the foot of it. Whoever touches the
mountain shall surely be put to death.
13He shall surely be stoned or shot with
arrows; not a hand is to be laid on him.
Whether man or animal, he shall not be
permitted to live.' Only when the ram's
horn sounds a long blast may they go
up to the mountain."
14After Moses had gone down the
mountain to the people, he consecrated
them, and they washed their clothes.
15Then he said to the people, "Prepare
yourselves for the third day. Abstain
from sexual relations."
16On the morning of the third day there
was thunder and lightning, with a thick
cloud over the mountain, and a very
loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the
camp trembled.
17Then Moses led the people out of the
camp to meet with God, and they stood
at the foot of the mountain.
18Mount Sinai was covered with smoke,
because the Lord descended on it in fire.
The smoke billowed up from it like
smoke from a furnace, the whole
mountain trembled violently,
19and the sound of the trumpet grew
louder and louder. Then Moses spoke
and the voice of God answered him.
20The Lord descended to the top of
Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top
of the mountain. So Moses went up
21and the Lord said to him, "Go down
and warn the people so they do not
force their way through to see the Lord
and many of them perish.
22Even the priests, who approach the
Lord , must consecrate themselves, or
the Lord will break out against them."
23Moses said to the Lord , "The people
cannot come up Mount Sinai, because
you yourself warned us, 'Put limits
around the mountain and set it apart as
holy.' "
24The Lord replied, "Go down and bring
Aaron up with you. But the priests and
the people must not force their way
through to come up to the Lord , or he
will break out against them."
25So Moses went down to the people
and told them.
20And God spoke all these words:
2"I am the Lord your God, who brought
you out of Egypt, out of the land of
slavery.
3"You shall have no other gods before
me.
4"You shall not make for yourself an idol
in the form of anything in heaven above
or on the earth beneath or in the waters
below.
5You shall not bow down to them or
worship them; for I, the Lord your God,
am a jealous God, punishing the
children for the sin of the fathers to the
third and fourth generation of those who
hate me,
6but showing love to a thousand
[generations] of those who love me and
keep my commandments.
7"You shall not misuse the name of the
Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold
anyone guiltless who misuses his name.
8"Remember the Sabbath day by
keeping it holy.
9Six days you shall labor and do all your
work,
10but the seventh day is a Sabbath to
the Lord your God. On it you shall not
do any work, neither you, nor your son
or daughter, nor your manservant or
maidservant, nor your animals, nor the
alien within your gates.
11For in six days the Lord made the
heavens and the earth, the sea, and all
that is in them, but he rested on the
seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed
the Sabbath day and made it holy.
12"Honor your father and your mother,
so that you may live long in the land the
Lord your God is giving you.
13"You shall not murder.
14"You shall not commit adultery.
15"You shall not steal.
16"You shall not give false testimony
against your neighbor.
17"You shall not covet your neighbor's
house. You shall not covet your
neighbor's wife, or his manservant or
maidservant, his ox or donkey, or
anything that belongs to your neighbor."
18When the people saw the thunder and
lightning and heard the trumpet and saw
the mountain in smoke, they trembled
with fear. They stayed at a distance
19and said to Moses, "Speak to us
yourself and we will listen. But do not
have God speak to us or we will die."
20Moses said to the people, "Do not be
afraid. God has come to test you, so
that the fear of God will be with you to
keep you from sinning."
21The people remained at a distance,
while Moses approached the thick
darkness where God was.
22Then the Lord said to Moses, "Tell the
Israelites this: 'You have seen for
yourselves that I have spoken to you
from heaven:
23Do not make any gods to be alongside
me; do not make for yourselves gods of
silver or gods of gold.
24" 'Make an altar of earth for me and
sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and
fellowship offerings, your sheep and
goats and your cattle. Wherever I cause
my name to be honored, I will come to
you and bless you.
25If you make an altar of stones for me,
do not build it with dressed stones, for
you will defile it if you use a tool on it.
26And do not go up to my altar on steps,
lest your nakedness be exposed on it.'
21"These are the laws you are to set
before them:
2"If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to
serve you for six years. But in the
seventh year, he shall go free, without
paying anything.
3If he comes alone, he is to go free
alone; but if he has a wife when he
comes, she is to go with him.
4If his master gives him a wife and she
bears him sons or daughters, the
woman and her children shall belong to
her master, and only the man shall go
free.
5"But if the servant declares, 'I love my
master and my wife and children and do
not want to go free,'
6then his master must take him before
the judges. He shall take him to the door
or the doorpost and pierce his ear with
an awl. Then he will be his servant for
life.
7"If a man sells his daughter as a
servant, she is not to go free as
menservants do.
8If she does not please the master who
has selected her for himself, he must let
her be redeemed. He has no right to sell
her to foreigners, because he has
broken faith with her.
9If he selects her for his son, he must
grant her the rights of a daughter.
10If he marries another woman, he must
not deprive the first one of her food,
clothing and marital rights.
11If he does not provide her with these
three things, she is to go free, without
any payment of money.
12"Anyone who strikes a man and kills
him shall surely be put to death.
13However, if he does not do it
intentionally, but God lets it happen, he
is to flee to a place I will designate.
14But if a man schemes and kills another
man deliberately, take him away from
my altar and put him to death.
15"Anyone who attacks his father or his
mother must be put to death.
16"Anyone who kidnaps another and
either sells him or still has him when he
is caught must be put to death.
17"Anyone who curses his father or
mother must be put to death.
18"If men quarrel and one hits the other
with a stone or with his fist and he does
not die but is confined to bed,
19the one who struck the blow will not be
held responsible if the other gets up and
walks around outside with his staff;
however, he must pay the injured man
for the loss of his time and see that he is
completely healed.
20"If a man beats his male or female
slave with a rod and the slave dies as a
direct result, he must be punished,
21but he is not to be punished if the
slave gets up after a day or two, since
the slave is his property.
22"If men who are fighting hit a pregnant
woman and she gives birth prematurely
but there is no serious injury, the
offender must be fined whatever the
woman's husband demands and the
court allows.
23But if there is serious injury, you are to
take life for life,
24eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for
hand, foot for foot,
25burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise
for bruise.
26"If a man hits a manservant or
maidservant in the eye and destroys it,
he must let the servant go free to
compensate for the eye.
27And if he knocks out the tooth of a
manservant or maidservant, he must let
the servant go free to compensate for
the tooth.
28"If a bull gores a man or a woman to
death, the bull must be stoned to death,
and its meat must not be eaten. But the
owner of the bull will not be held
responsible.
29If, however, the bull has had the habit
of goring and the owner has been
warned but has not kept it penned up
and it kills a man or woman, the bull
must be stoned and the owner also
must be put to death.
30However, if payment is demanded of
him, he may redeem his life by paying
whatever is demanded.
31This law also applies if the bull gores a
son or daughter.
32If the bull gores a male or female slave,
the owner must pay thirty shekels of
silver to the master of the slave, and the
bull must be stoned.
33"If a man uncovers a pit or digs one
and fails to cover it and an ox or a
donkey falls into it,
34the owner of the pit must pay for the
loss; he must pay its owner, and the
dead animal will be his.
35"If a man's bull injures the bull of
another and it dies, they are to sell the
live one and divide both the money and
the dead animal equally.
36However, if it was known that the bull
had the habit of goring, yet the owner
did not keep it penned up, the owner
must pay, animal for animal, and the
dead animal will be his.
22"If a man steals an ox or a sheep
and slaughters it or sells it, he must pay
back five head of cattle for the ox and
four sheep for the sheep.
2"If a thief is caught breaking in and is
struck so that he dies, the defender is
not guilty of bloodshed;
3but if it happens after sunrise, he is
guilty of bloodshed. "A thief must
certainly make restitution, but if he has
nothing, he must be sold to pay for his
theft.
4"If the stolen animal is found alive in his
possession-whether ox or donkey or
sheep-he must pay back double.
5"If a man grazes his livestock in a field
or vineyard and lets them stray and they
graze in another man's field, he must
make restitution from the best of his own
field or vineyard.
6"If a fire breaks out and spreads into
thornbushes so that it burns shocks of
grain or standing grain or the whole field,
the one who started the fire must make
restitution.
7"If a man gives his neighbor silver or
goods for safekeeping and they are
stolen from the neighbor's house, the
thief, if he is caught, must pay back
double.
8But if the thief is not found, the owner of
the house must appear before the
judges to determine whether he has laid
his hands on the other man's property.
9In all cases of illegal possession of an
ox, a donkey, a sheep, a garment, or
any other lost property about which
somebody says, 'This is mine,' both
parties are to bring their cases before
the judges. The one whom the judges
declare guilty must pay back double to
his neighbor.
10"If a man gives a donkey, an ox, a
sheep or any other animal to his
neighbor for safekeeping and it dies or
is injured or is taken away while no one
is looking,
11the issue between them will be settled
by the taking of an oath before the Lord
that the neighbor did not lay hands on
the other person's property. The owner
is to accept this, and no restitution is
required.
12But if the animal was stolen from the
neighbor, he must make restitution to
the owner.
13If it was torn to pieces by a wild animal,
he shall bring in the remains as
evidence and he will not be required to
pay for the torn animal.
14"If a man borrows an animal from his
neighbor and it is injured or dies while
the owner is not present, he must make
restitution.
15But if the owner is with the animal, the
borrower will not have to pay. If the
animal was hired, the money paid for
the hire covers the loss.
16"If a man seduces a virgin who is not
pledged to be married and sleeps with
her, he must pay the bride-price, and
she shall be his wife.
17If her father absolutely refuses to give
her to him, he must still pay the brideprice
for virgins.
18"Do not allow a sorceress to live.
19"Anyone who has sexual relations with
an animal must be put to death.
20"Whoever sacrifices to any god other
than the Lord must be destroyed.
21"Do not mistreat an alien or oppress
him, for you were aliens in Egypt.
22"Do not take advantage of a widow or
an orphan.
23If you do and they cry out to me, I will
certainly hear their cry.
24My anger will be aroused, and I will kill
you with the sword; your wives will
become widows and your children
fatherless.
25"If you lend money to one of my
people among you who is needy, do not
be like a moneylender; charge him no
interest.
26If you take your neighbor's cloak as a
pledge, return it to him by sunset,
27because his cloak is the only covering
he has for his body. What else will he
sleep in? When he cries out to me, I will
hear, for I am compassionate.
28"Do not blaspheme God or curse the
ruler of your people.
29"Do not hold back offerings from your
granaries or your vats. "You must give
me the firstborn of your sons.
30Do the same with your cattle and your
sheep. Let them stay with their mothers
for seven days, but give them to me on
the eighth day.
31"You are to be my holy people. So do
not eat the meat of an animal torn by
wild beasts; throw it to the dogs.
23"Do not spread false reports. Do
not help a wicked man by being a
malicious witness.
2"Do not follow the crowd in doing wrong.
When you give testimony in a lawsuit,
do not pervert justice by siding with the
crowd,
3and do not show favoritism to a poor
man in his lawsuit.
4"If you come across your enemy's ox or
donkey wandering off, be sure to take it
back to him.
5If you see the donkey of someone who
hates you fallen down under its load, do
not leave it there; be sure you help him
with it.
6"Do not deny justice to your poor
people in their lawsuits.
7Have nothing to do with a false charge
and do not put an innocent or honest
person to death, for I will not acquit the
guilty.
8"Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe
blinds those who see and twists the
words of the righteous.
9"Do not oppress an alien; you
yourselves know how it feels to be
aliens, because you were aliens in
Egypt.
10"For six years you are to sow your
fields and harvest the crops,
11but during the seventh year let the
land lie unplowed and unused. Then the
poor among your people may get food
from it, and the wild animals may eat
what they leave. Do the same with your
vineyard and your olive grove.
12"Six days do your work, but on the
seventh day do not work, so that your ox
and your donkey may rest and the slave
born in your household, and the alien as
well, may be refreshed.
13"Be careful to do everything I have
said to you. Do not invoke the names of
other gods; do not let them be heard on
your lips.
14"Three times a year you are to
celebrate a festival to me.
15"Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened
Bread; for seven days eat bread made
without yeast, as I commanded you. Do
this at the appointed time in the month
of Abib, for in that month you came out
of Egypt. "No one is to appear before
me empty-handed.
16"Celebrate the Feast of Harvest with
the firstfruits of the crops you sow in
your field. "Celebrate the Feast of
Ingathering at the end of the year, when
you gather in your crops from the field.
17"Three times a year all the men are to
appear before the Sovereign Lord .
18"Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to
me along with anything containing yeast.
"The fat of my festival offerings must not
be kept until morning.
19"Bring the best of the firstfruits of your
soil to the house of the Lord your God.
"Do not cook a young goat in its
mother's milk.
20"See, I am sending an angel ahead of
you to guard you along the way and to
bring you to the place I have prepared.
21Pay attention to him and listen to what
he says. Do not rebel against him; he
will not forgive your rebellion, since my
Name is in him.
22If you listen carefully to what he says
and do all that I say, I will be an enemy
to your enemies and will oppose those
who oppose you.
23My angel will go ahead of you and
bring you into the land of the Amorites,
Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites
and Jebusites, and I will wipe them out.
24Do not bow down before their gods or
worship them or follow their practices.
You must demolish them and break their
sacred stones to pieces.
25Worship the Lord your God, and his
blessing will be on your food and water.
I will take away sickness from among
you,
26and none will miscarry or be barren in
your land. I will give you a full life span.
27"I will send my terror ahead of you and
throw into confusion every nation you
encounter. I will make all your enemies
turn their backs and run.
28I will send the hornet ahead of you to
drive the Hivites, Canaanites and
Hittites out of your way.
29But I will not drive them out in a single
year, because the land would become
desolate and the wild animals too
numerous for you.
30Little by little I will drive them out
before you, until you have increased
enough to take possession of the land.
31"I will establish your borders from the
Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines,
and from the desert to the River. I will
hand over to you the people who live in
the land and you will drive them out
before you.
32Do not make a covenant with them or
with their gods.
33Do not let them live in your land, or
they will cause you to sin against me,
because the worship of their gods will
certainly be a snare to you."
24Then he said to Moses, "Come up
to the Lord , you and Aaron, Nadab and
Abihu, and seventy of the elders of
Israel. You are to worship at a distance,
2but Moses alone is to approach the
Lord ; the others must not come near.
And the people may not come up with
him."
3When Moses went and told the people
all the Lord 's words and laws, they
responded with one voice, "Everything
the Lord has said we will do."
4Moses then wrote down everything the
Lord had said. He got up early the next
morning and built an altar at the foot of
the mountain and set up twelve stone
pillars representing the twelve tribes of
Israel.
5Then he sent young Israelite men, and
they offered burnt offerings and
sacrificed young bulls as fellowship
offerings to the Lord .
6Moses took half of the blood and put it
in bowls, and the other half he sprinkled
on the altar.
7Then he took the Book of the Covenant
and read it to the people. They
responded, "We will do everything the
Lord has said; we will obey."
8Moses then took the blood, sprinkled it
on the people and said, "This is the
blood of the covenant that the Lord has
made with you in accordance with all
these words."
9Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu,
and the seventy elders of Israel went up
10and saw the God of Israel. Under his
feet was something like a pavement
made of sapphire, clear as the sky itself.
11But God did not raise his hand against
these leaders of the Israelites; they saw
God, and they ate and drank.
12The Lord said to Moses, "Come up to
me on the mountain and stay here, and I
will give you the tablets of stone, with
the law and commands I have written for
their instruction."
13Then Moses set out with Joshua his
aide, and Moses went up on the
mountain of God.
14He said to the elders, "Wait here for us
until we come back to you. Aaron and
Hur are with you, and anyone involved
in a dispute can go to them."
15When Moses went up on the mountain,
the cloud covered it,
16and the glory of the Lord settled on
Mount Sinai. For six days the cloud
covered the mountain, and on the
seventh day the Lord called to Moses
from within the cloud.
17To the Israelites the glory of the Lord
looked like a consuming fire on top of
the mountain.
18Then Moses entered the cloud as he
went on up the mountain. And he stayed
on the mountain forty days and forty
nights.
25The Lord said to Moses,
2"Tell the Israelites to bring me an
offering. You are to receive the offering
for me from each man whose heart
prompts him to give.
3These are the offerings you are to
receive from them: gold, silver and
bronze;
4blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine
linen; goat hair;
5ram skins dyed red and hides of sea
cows ; acacia wood;
6olive oil for the light; spices for the
anointing oil and for the fragrant
incense;
7and onyx stones and other gems to be
mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
8"Then have them make a sanctuary for
me, and I will dwell among them.
9Make this tabernacle and all its
furnishings exactly like the pattern I will
show you.
10"Have them make a chest of acacia
wood-two and a half cubits long, a cubit
and a half wide, and a cubit and a half
high.
11Overlay it with pure gold, both inside
and out, and make a gold molding
around it.
12Cast four gold rings for it and fasten
them to its four feet, with two rings on
one side and two rings on the other.
13Then make poles of acacia wood and
overlay them with gold.
14Insert the poles into the rings on the
sides of the chest to carry it.
15The poles are to remain in the rings of
this ark; they are not to be removed.
16Then put in the ark the Testimony,
which I will give you.
17"Make an atonement cover of pure
gold-two and a half cubits long and a
cubit and a half wide.
18And make two cherubim out of
hammered gold at the ends of the cover.
19Make one cherub on one end and the
second cherub on the other; make the
cherubim of one piece with the cover, at
the two ends.
20The cherubim are to have their wings
spread upward, overshadowing the
cover with them. The cherubim are to
face each other, looking toward the
cover.
21Place the cover on top of the ark and
put in the ark the Testimony, which I will
give you.
22There, above the cover between the
two cherubim that are over the ark of the
Testimony, I will meet with you and give
you all my commands for the Israelites.
23"Make a table of acacia wood-two
cubits long, a cubit wide and a cubit and
a half high.
24Overlay it with pure gold and make a
gold molding around it.
25Also make around it a rim a
handbreadth wide and put a gold
molding on the rim.
26Make four gold rings for the table and
fasten them to the four corners, where
the four legs are.
27The rings are to be close to the rim to
hold the poles used in carrying the table.
28Make the poles of acacia wood,
overlay them with gold and carry the
table with them.
29And make its plates and dishes of pure
gold, as well as its pitchers and bowls
for the pouring out of offerings.
30Put the bread of the Presence on this
table to be before me at all times.
31"Make a lampstand of pure gold and
hammer it out, base and shaft; its
flowerlike cups, buds and blossoms
shall be of one piece with it.
32Six branches are to extend from the
sides of the lampstand-three on one
side and three on the other.
33Three cups shaped like almond
flowers with buds and blossoms are to
be on one branch, three on the next
branch, and the same for all six
branches extending from the lampstand.
34And on the lampstand there are to be
four cups shaped like almond flowers
with buds and blossoms.
35One bud shall be under the first pair of
branches extending from the lampstand,
a second bud under the second pair,
and a third bud under the third pair-six
branches in all.
36The buds and branches shall all be of
one piece with the lampstand,
hammered out of pure gold.
37"Then make its seven lamps and set
them up on it so that they light the space
in front of it.
38Its wick trimmers and trays are to be of
pure gold.
39A talent of pure gold is to be used for
the lampstand and all these accessories.
40See that you make them according to
the pattern shown you on the mountain.
26"Make the tabernacle with ten
curtains of finely twisted linen and blue,
purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim
worked into them by a skilled craftsman.
2All the curtains are to be the same sizetwenty-
eight cubits long and four cubits
wide.
3Join five of the curtains together, and
do the same with the other five.
4Make loops of blue material along the
edge of the end curtain in one set, and
do the same with the end curtain in the
other set.
5Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty
loops on the end curtain of the other set,
with the loops opposite each other.
6Then make fifty gold clasps and use
them to fasten the curtains together so
that the tabernacle is a unit.
7"Make curtains of goat hair for the tent
over the tabernacle-eleven altogether.
8All eleven curtains are to be the same
size-thirty cubits long and four cubits
wide.
9Join five of the curtains together into
one set and the other six into another
set. Fold the sixth curtain double at the
front of the tent.
10Make fifty loops along the edge of the
end curtain in one set and also along
the edge of the end curtain in the other
set.
11Then make fifty bronze clasps and put
them in the loops to fasten the tent
together as a unit.
12As for the additional length of the tent
curtains, the half curtain that is left over
is to hang down at the rear of the
tabernacle.
13The tent curtains will be a cubit longer
on both sides; what is left will hang over
the sides of the tabernacle so as to
cover it.
14Make for the tent a covering of ram
skins dyed red, and over that a covering
of hides of sea cows.
15"Make upright frames of acacia wood
for the tabernacle.
16Each frame is to be ten cubits long
and a cubit and a half wide,
17with two projections set parallel to
each other. Make all the frames of the
tabernacle in this way.
18Make twenty frames for the south side
of the tabernacle
19and make forty silver bases to go
under them-two bases for each frame,
one under each projection.
20For the other side, the north side of the
tabernacle, make twenty frames
21and forty silver bases-two under each
frame.
22Make six frames for the far end, that is,
the west end of the tabernacle,
23and make two frames for the corners
at the far end.
24At these two corners they must be
double from the bottom all the way to
the top, and fitted into a single ring; both
shall be like that.
25So there will be eight frames and
sixteen silver bases-two under each
frame.
26"Also make crossbars of acacia wood:
five for the frames on one side of the
tabernacle,
27five for those on the other side, and
five for the frames on the west, at the far
end of the tabernacle.
28The center crossbar is to extend from
end to end at the middle of the frames.
29Overlay the frames with gold and
make gold rings to hold the crossbars.
Also overlay the crossbars with gold.
30"Set up the tabernacle according to the
plan shown you on the mountain.
31"Make a curtain of blue, purple and
scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with
cherubim worked into it by a skilled
craftsman.
32Hang it with gold hooks on four posts
of acacia wood overlaid with gold and
standing on four silver bases.
33Hang the curtain from the clasps and
place the ark of the Testimony behind
the curtain. The curtain will separate the
Holy Place from the Most Holy Place.
34Put the atonement cover on the ark of
the Testimony in the Most Holy Place.
35Place the table outside the curtain on
the north side of the tabernacle and put
the lampstand opposite it on the south
side.
36"For the entrance to the tent make a
curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn
and finely twisted linen-the work of an
embroiderer.
37Make gold hooks for this curtain and
five posts of acacia wood overlaid with
gold. And cast five bronze bases for
them.
27"Build an altar of acacia wood,
three cubits high; it is to be square, five
cubits long and five cubits wide.
2Make a horn at each of the four corners,
so that the horns and the altar are of
one piece, and overlay the altar with
bronze.
3Make all its utensils of bronze-its pots
to remove the ashes, and its shovels,
sprinkling bowls, meat forks and
firepans.
4Make a grating for it, a bronze network,
and make a bronze ring at each of the
four corners of the network.
5Put it under the ledge of the altar so
that it is halfway up the altar.
6Make poles of acacia wood for the altar
and overlay them with bronze.
7The poles are to be inserted into the
rings so they will be on two sides of the
altar when it is carried.
8Make the altar hollow, out of boards. It
is to be made just as you were shown
on the mountain.
9"Make a courtyard for the tabernacle.
The south side shall be a hundred cubits
long and is to have curtains of finely
twisted linen,
10with twenty posts and twenty bronze
bases and with silver hooks and bands
on the posts.
11The north side shall also be a hundred
cubits long and is to have curtains, with
twenty posts and twenty bronze bases
and with silver hooks and bands on the
posts.
12"The west end of the courtyard shall
be fifty cubits wide and have curtains,
with ten posts and ten bases.
13On the east end, toward the sunrise,
the courtyard shall also be fifty cubits
wide.
14Curtains fifteen cubits long are to be
on one side of the entrance, with three
posts and three bases,
15and curtains fifteen cubits long are to
be on the other side, with three posts
and three bases.
16"For the entrance to the courtyard,
provide a curtain twenty cubits long, of
blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely
twisted linen-the work of an
embroiderer-with four posts and four
bases.
17All the posts around the courtyard are
to have silver bands and hooks, and
bronze bases.
18The courtyard shall be a hundred
cubits long and fifty cubits wide, with
curtains of finely twisted linen five cubits
high, and with bronze bases.
19All the other articles used in the
service of the tabernacle, whatever their
function, including all the tent pegs for it
and those for the courtyard, are to be of
bronze.
20"Command the Israelites to bring you
clear oil of pressed olives for the light so
that the lamps may be kept burning.
21In the Tent of Meeting, outside the
curtain that is in front of the Testimony,
Aaron and his sons are to keep the
lamps burning before the Lord from
evening till morning. This is to be a
lasting ordinance among the Israelites
for the generations to come.
28"Have Aaron your brother brought
to you from among the Israelites, along
with his sons Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar
and Ithamar, so they may serve me as
priests.
2Make sacred garments for your brother
Aaron, to give him dignity and honor.
3Tell all the skilled men to whom I have
given wisdom in such matters that they
are to make garments for Aaron, for his
consecration, so he may serve me as
priest.
4These are the garments they are to
make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe,
a woven tunic, a turban and a sash.
They are to make these sacred
garments for your brother Aaron and his
sons, so they may serve me as priests.
5Have them use gold, and blue, purple
and scarlet yarn, and fine linen.
6"Make the ephod of gold, and of blue,
purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely
twisted linen-the work of a skilled
craftsman.
7It is to have two shoulder pieces
attached to two of its corners, so it can
be fastened.
8Its skillfully woven waistband is to be
like it-of one piece with the ephod and
made with gold, and with blue, purple
and scarlet yarn, and with finely twisted
linen.
9"Take two onyx stones and engrave on
them the names of the sons of Israel
10in the order of their birth-six names on
one stone and the remaining six on the
other.
11Engrave the names of the sons of
Israel on the two stones the way a gem
cutter engraves a seal. Then mount the
stones in gold filigree settings
12and fasten them on the shoulder
pieces of the ephod as memorial stones
for the sons of Israel. Aaron is to bear
the names on his shoulders as a
memorial before the Lord .
13Make gold filigree settings
14and two braided chains of pure gold,
like a rope, and attach the chains to the
settings.
15"Fashion a breastpiece for making
decisions-the work of a skilled craftsman.
Make it like the ephod: of gold, and of
blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of
finely twisted linen.
16It is to be square-a span long and a
span wide-and folded double.
17Then mount four rows of precious
stones on it. In the first row there shall
be a ruby, a topaz and a beryl;
18in the second row a turquoise, a
sapphire and an emerald;
19in the third row a jacinth, an agate and
an amethyst;
20in the fourth row a chrysolite, an onyx
and a jasper. Mount them in gold filigree
settings.
21There are to be twelve stones, one for
each of the names of the sons of Israel,
each engraved like a seal with the name
of one of the twelve tribes.
22"For the breastpiece make braided
chains of pure gold, like a rope.
23Make two gold rings for it and fasten
them to two corners of the breastpiece.
24Fasten the two gold chains to the rings
at the corners of the breastpiece,
25and the other ends of the chains to the
two settings, attaching them to the
shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.
26Make two gold rings and attach them
to the other two corners of the
breastpiece on the inside edge next to
the ephod.
27Make two more gold rings and attach
them to the bottom of the shoulder
pieces on the front of the ephod, close
to the seam just above the waistband of
the ephod.
28The rings of the breastpiece are to be
tied to the rings of the ephod with blue
cord, connecting it to the waistband, so
that the breastpiece will not swing out
from the ephod.
29"Whenever Aaron enters the Holy
Place, he will bear the names of the
sons of Israel over his heart on the
breastpiece of decision as a continuing
memorial before the Lord .
30Also put the Urim and the Thummim in
the breastpiece, so they may be over
Aaron's heart whenever he enters the
presence of the Lord . Thus Aaron will
always bear the means of making
decisions for the Israelites over his heart
before the Lord .
31"Make the robe of the ephod entirely of
blue cloth,
32with an opening for the head in its
center. There shall be a woven edge like
a collar around this opening, so that it
will not tear.
33Make pomegranates of blue, purple
and scarlet yarn around the hem of the
robe, with gold bells between them.
34The gold bells and the pomegranates
are to alternate around the hem of the
robe.
35Aaron must wear it when he ministers.
The sound of the bells will be heard
when he enters the Holy Place before
the Lord and when he comes out, so
that he will not die.
36"Make a plate of pure gold and
engrave on it as on a seal:HOLY TO
THE Lord .
37Fasten a blue cord to it to attach it to
the turban; it is to be on the front of the
turban.
38It will be on Aaron's forehead, and he
will bear the guilt involved in the sacred
gifts the Israelites consecrate, whatever
their gifts may be. It will be on Aaron's
forehead continually so that they will be
acceptable to the Lord .
39"Weave the tunic of fine linen and
make the turban of fine linen. The sash
is to be the work of an embroiderer.
40Make tunics, sashes and headbands
for Aaron's sons, to give them dignity
and honor.
41After you put these clothes on your
brother Aaron and his sons, anoint and
ordain them. Consecrate them so they
may serve me as priests.
42"Make linen undergarments as a
covering for the body, reaching from the
waist to the thigh.
43Aaron and his sons must wear them
whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting
or approach the altar to minister in the
Holy Place, so that they will not incur
guilt and die. "This is to be a lasting
ordinance for Aaron and his
descendants.
29"This is what you are to do to
consecrate them, so they may serve me
as priests: Take a young bull and two
rams without defect.
2And from fine wheat flour, without yeast,
make bread, and cakes mixed with oil,
and wafers spread with oil.
3Put them in a basket and present them
in it-along with the bull and the two rams.
4Then bring Aaron and his sons to the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting and
wash them with water.
5Take the garments and dress Aaron
with the tunic, the robe of the ephod, the
ephod itself and the breastpiece. Fasten
the ephod on him by its skillfully woven
waistband.
6Put the turban on his head and attach
the sacred diadem to the turban.
7Take the anointing oil and anoint him
by pouring it on his head.
8Bring his sons and dress them in tunics
9and put headbands on them. Then tie
sashes on Aaron and his sons. The
priesthood is theirs by a lasting
ordinance. In this way you shall ordain
Aaron and his sons.
10"Bring the bull to the front of the Tent
of Meeting, and Aaron and his sons
shall lay their hands on its head.
11Slaughter it in the Lord 's presence at
the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
12Take some of the bull's blood and put
it on the horns of the altar with your
finger, and pour out the rest of it at the
base of the altar.
13Then take all the fat around the inner
parts, the covering of the liver, and both
kidneys with the fat on them, and burn
them on the altar.
14But burn the bull's flesh and its hide
and its offal outside the camp. It is a sin
offering.
15"Take one of the rams, and Aaron and
his sons shall lay their hands on its head.
16Slaughter it and take the blood and
sprinkle it against the altar on all sides.
17Cut the ram into pieces and wash the
inner parts and the legs, putting them
with the head and the other pieces.
18Then burn the entire ram on the altar.
It is a burnt offering to the Lord , a
pleasing aroma, an offering made to the
Lord by fire.
19"Take the other ram, and Aaron and
his sons shall lay their hands on its head.
20Slaughter it, take some of its blood
and put it on the lobes of the right ears
of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of
their right hands, and on the big toes of
their right feet. Then sprinkle blood
against the altar on all sides.
21And take some of the blood on the
altar and some of the anointing oil and
sprinkle it on Aaron and his garments
and on his sons and their garments.
Then he and his sons and their
garments will be consecrated.
22"Take from this ram the fat, the fat tail,
the fat around the inner parts, the
covering of the liver, both kidneys with
the fat on them, and the right thigh.
(This is the ram for the ordination.)
23From the basket of bread made
without yeast, which is before the Lord ,
take a loaf, and a cake made with oil,
and a wafer.
24Put all these in the hands of Aaron and
his sons and wave them before the Lord
as a wave offering.
25Then take them from their hands and
burn them on the altar along with the
burnt offering for a pleasing aroma to
the Lord , an offering made to the Lord
by fire.
26After you take the breast of the ram for
Aaron's ordination, wave it before the
Lord as a wave offering, and it will be
your share.
27"Consecrate those parts of the
ordination ram that belong to Aaron and
his sons: the breast that was waved and
the thigh that was presented.
28This is always to be the regular share
from the Israelites for Aaron and his
sons. It is the contribution the Israelites
are to make to the Lord from their
fellowship offerings.
29"Aaron's sacred garments will belong
to his descendants so that they can be
anointed and ordained in them.
30The son who succeeds him as priest
and comes to the Tent of Meeting to
minister in the Holy Place is to wear
them seven days.
31"Take the ram for the ordination and
cook the meat in a sacred place.
32At the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
Aaron and his sons are to eat the meat
of the ram and the bread that is in the
basket.
33They are to eat these offerings by
which atonement was made for their
ordination and consecration. But no one
else may eat them, because they are
sacred.
34And if any of the meat of the ordination
ram or any bread is left over till morning,
burn it up. It must not be eaten, because
it is sacred.
35"Do for Aaron and his sons everything
I have commanded you, taking seven
days to ordain them.
36Sacrifice a bull each day as a sin
offering to make atonement. Purify the
altar by making atonement for it, and
anoint it to consecrate it.
37For seven days make atonement for
the altar and consecrate it. Then the
altar will be most holy, and whatever
touches it will be holy.
38"This is what you are to offer on the
altar regularly each day: two lambs a
year old.
39Offer one in the morning and the other
at twilight.
40With the first lamb offer a tenth of an
ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter
of a hin of oil from pressed olives, and a
quarter of a hin of wine as a drink
offering.
41Sacrifice the other lamb at twilight with
the same grain offering and its drink
offering as in the morning-a pleasing
aroma, an offering made to the Lord by
fire.
42"For the generations to come this burnt
offering is to be made regularly at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting before
the Lord . There I will meet you and
speak to you;
43there also I will meet with the Israelites,
and the place will be consecrated by my
glory.
44"So I will consecrate the Tent of
Meeting and the altar and will
consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve
me as priests.
45Then I will dwell among the Israelites
and be their God.
46They will know that I am the Lord their
God, who brought them out of Egypt so
that I might dwell among them. I am the
Lord their God.
30"Make an altar of acacia wood for
burning incense.
2It is to be square, a cubit long and a
cubit wide, and two cubits high -its horns
of one piece with it.
3Overlay the top and all the sides and
the horns with pure gold, and make a
gold molding around it.
4Make two gold rings for the altar below
the molding-two on opposite sides-to
hold the poles used to carry it.
5Make the poles of acacia wood and
overlay them with gold.
6Put the altar in front of the curtain that
is before the ark of the Testimonybefore
the atonement cover that is over
the Testimony-where I will meet with
you.
7"Aaron must burn fragrant incense on
the altar every morning when he tends
the lamps.
8He must burn incense again when he
lights the lamps at twilight so incense
will burn regularly before the Lord for the
generations to come.
9Do not offer on this altar any other
incense or any burnt offering or grain
offering, and do not pour a drink offering
on it.
10Once a year Aaron shall make
atonement on its horns. This annual
atonement must be made with the blood
of the atoning sin offering for the
generations to come. It is most holy to
the Lord ."
11Then the Lord said to Moses,
12"When you take a census of the
Israelites to count them, each one must
pay the Lord a ransom for his life at the
time he is counted. Then no plague will
come on them when you number them.
13Each one who crosses over to those
already counted is to give a half shekel,
according to the sanctuary shekel,
which weighs twenty gerahs. This half
shekel is an offering to the Lord .
14All who cross over, those twenty years
old or more, are to give an offering to
the Lord .
15The rich are not to give more than a
half shekel and the poor are not to give
less when you make the offering to the
Lord to atone for your lives.
16Receive the atonement money from
the Israelites and use it for the service of
the Tent of Meeting. It will be a
memorial for the Israelites before the
Lord , making atonement for your lives."
17Then the Lord said to Moses,
18"Make a bronze basin, with its bronze
stand, for washing. Place it between the
Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put
water in it.
19Aaron and his sons are to wash their
hands and feet with water from it.
20Whenever they enter the Tent of
Meeting, they shall wash with water so
that they will not die. Also, when they
approach the altar to minister by
presenting an offering made to the Lord
by fire,
21they shall wash their hands and feet
so that they will not die. This is to be a
lasting ordinance for Aaron and his
descendants for the generations to
come."
22Then the Lord said to Moses,
23"Take the following fine spices: 500
shekels of liquid myrrh, half as much
(that is, 250 shekels) of fragrant
cinnamon, 250 shekels of fragrant cane,
24500 shekels of cassia-all according to
the sanctuary shekel-and a hin of olive
oil.
25Make these into a sacred anointing oil,
a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer.
It will be the sacred anointing oil.
26Then use it to anoint the Tent of
Meeting, the ark of the Testimony,
27the table and all its articles, the
lampstand and its accessories, the altar
of incense,
28the altar of burnt offering and all its
utensils, and the basin with its stand.
29You shall consecrate them so they will
be most holy, and whatever touches
them will be holy.
30"Anoint Aaron and his sons and
consecrate them so they may serve me
as priests.
31Say to the Israelites, 'This is to be my
sacred anointing oil for the generations
to come.
32Do not pour it on men's bodies and do
not make any oil with the same formula.
It is sacred, and you are to consider it
sacred.
33Whoever makes perfume like it and
whoever puts it on anyone other than a
priest must be cut off from his people.' "
34Then the Lord said to Moses, "Take
fragrant spices-gum resin, onycha and
galbanum-and pure frankincense, all in
equal amounts,
35and make a fragrant blend of incense,
the work of a perfumer. It is to be salted
and pure and sacred.
36Grind some of it to powder and place it
in front of the Testimony in the Tent of
Meeting, where I will meet with you. It
shall be most holy to you.
37Do not make any incense with this
formula for yourselves; consider it holy
to the Lord .
38Whoever makes any like it to enjoy its
fragrance must be cut off from his
people."
31Then the Lord said to Moses,
2"See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri,
the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
3and I have filled him with the Spirit of
God, with skill, ability and knowledge in
all kinds of crafts-
4to make artistic designs for work in gold,
silver and bronze,
5to cut and set stones, to work in wood,
and to engage in all kinds of
craftsmanship.
6Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab
son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, to
help him. Also I have given skill to all the
craftsmen to make everything I have
commanded you:
7the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the
Testimony with the atonement cover on
it, and all the other furnishings of the
tent-
8the table and its articles, the pure gold
lampstand and all its accessories, the
altar of incense,
9the altar of burnt offering and all its
utensils, the basin with its stand-
10and also the woven garments, both the
sacred garments for Aaron the priest
and the garments for his sons when
they serve as priests,
11and the anointing oil and fragrant
incense for the Holy Place. They are to
make them just as I commanded you."
12Then the Lord said to Moses,
13"Say to the Israelites, 'You must
observe my Sabbaths. This will be a
sign between me and you for the
generations to come, so you may know
that I am the Lord , who makes you holy.
14" 'Observe the Sabbath, because it is
holy to you. Anyone who desecrates it
must be put to death; whoever does any
work on that day must be cut off from
his people.
15For six days, work is to be done, but
the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest,
holy to the Lord . Whoever does any
work on the Sabbath day must be put to
death.
16The Israelites are to observe the
Sabbath, celebrating it for the
generations to come as a lasting
covenant.
17It will be a sign between me and the
Israelites forever, for in six days the
Lord made the heavens and the earth,
and on the seventh day he abstained
from work and rested.' "
18When the Lord finished speaking to
Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the
two tablets of the Testimony, the tablets
of stone inscribed by the finger of God.
32When the people saw that Moses
was so long in coming down from the
mountain, they gathered around Aaron
and said, "Come, make us gods who will
go before us. As for this fellow Moses
who brought us up out of Egypt, we
don't know what has happened to him."
2Aaron answered them, "Take off the
gold earrings that your wives, your sons
and your daughters are wearing, and
bring them to me."
3So all the people took off their earrings
and brought them to Aaron.
4He took what they handed him and
made it into an idol cast in the shape of
a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then
they said, "These are your gods, O
Israel, who brought you up out of
Egypt."
5When Aaron saw this, he built an altar
in front of the calf and announced,
"Tomorrow there will be a festival to the
Lord ."
6So the next day the people rose early
and sacrificed burnt offerings and
presented fellowship offerings.
Afterward they sat down to eat and drink
and got up to indulge in revelry.
7Then the Lord said to Moses, "Go down,
because your people, whom you
brought up out of Egypt, have become
corrupt.
8They have been quick to turn away
from what I commanded them and have
made themselves an idol cast in the
shape of a calf. They have bowed down
to it and sacrificed to it and have said,
'These are your gods, O Israel, who
brought you up out of Egypt.'
9"I have seen these people," the Lord
said to Moses, "and they are a stiffnecked
people.
10Now leave me alone so that my anger
may burn against them and that I may
destroy them. Then I will make you into
a great nation."
11But Moses sought the favor of the Lord
his God. "O Lord ," he said, "why should
your anger burn against your people,
whom you brought out of Egypt with
great power and a mighty hand?
12Why should the Egyptians say, 'It was
with evil intent that he brought them out,
to kill them in the mountains and to wipe
them off the face of the earth'? Turn
from your fierce anger; relent and do not
bring disaster on your people.
13Remember your servants Abraham,
Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by
your own self: 'I will make your
descendants as numerous as the stars
in the sky and I will give your
descendants all this land I promised
them, and it will be their inheritance
forever.' "
14Then the Lord relented and did not
bring on his people the disaster he had
threatened.
15Moses turned and went down the
mountain with the two tablets of the
Testimony in his hands. They were
inscribed on both sides, front and back.
16The tablets were the work of God; the
writing was the writing of God, engraved
on the tablets.
17When Joshua heard the noise of the
people shouting, he said to Moses,
"There is the sound of war in the camp."
18Moses replied: "It is not the sound of
victory, it is not the sound of defeat; it is
the sound of singing that I hear."
19When Moses approached the camp
and saw the calf and the dancing, his
anger burned and he threw the tablets
out of his hands, breaking them to
pieces at the foot of the mountain.
20And he took the calf they had made
and burned it in the fire; then he ground
it to powder, scattered it on the water
and made the Israelites drink it.
21He said to Aaron, "What did these
people do to you, that you led them into
such great sin?"
22"Do not be angry, my lord," Aaron
answered. "You know how prone these
people are to evil.
23They said to me, 'Make us gods who
will go before us. As for this fellow
Moses who brought us up out of Egypt,
we don't know what has happened to
him.'
24So I told them, 'Whoever has any gold
jewelry, take it off.' Then they gave me
the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and
out came this calf!"
25Moses saw that the people were
running wild and that Aaron had let them
get out of control and so become a
laughingstock to their enemies.
26So he stood at the entrance to the
camp and said, "Whoever is for the
Lord , come to me." And all the Levites
rallied to him.
27Then he said to them, "This is what the
Lord , the God of Israel, says: 'Each
man strap a sword to his side. Go back
and forth through the camp from one
end to the other, each killing his brother
and friend and neighbor.' "
28The Levites did as Moses commanded,
and that day about three thousand of
the people died.
29Then Moses said, "You have been set
apart to the Lord today, for you were
against your own sons and brothers,
and he has blessed you this day."
30The next day Moses said to the people,
"You have committed a great sin. But
now I will go up to the Lord ; perhaps I
can make atonement for your sin."
31So Moses went back to the Lord and
said, "Oh, what a great sin these people
have committed! They have made
themselves gods of gold.
32But now, please forgive their sin-but if
not, then blot me out of the book you
have written."
33The Lord replied to Moses, "Whoever
has sinned against me I will blot out of
my book.
34Now go, lead the people to the place I
spoke of, and my angel will go before
you. However, when the time comes for
me to punish, I will punish them for their
sin."
35And the Lord struck the people with a
plague because of what they did with
the calf Aaron had made.
33Then the Lord said to Moses,
"Leave this place, you and the people
you brought up out of Egypt, and go up
to the land I promised on oath to
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, 'I
will give it to your descendants.'
2I will send an angel before you and
drive out the Canaanites, Amorites,
Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
3Go up to the land flowing with milk and
honey. But I will not go with you,
because you are a stiff-necked people
and I might destroy you on the way."
4When the people heard these
distressing words, they began to mourn
and no one put on any ornaments.
5For the Lord had said to Moses, "Tell
the Israelites, 'You are a stiff-necked
people. If I were to go with you even for
a moment, I might destroy you. Now
take off your ornaments and I will decide
what to do with you.' "
6So the Israelites stripped off their
ornaments at Mount Horeb.
7Now Moses used to take a tent and
pitch it outside the camp some distance
away, calling it the "tent of meeting."
Anyone inquiring of the Lord would go to
the tent of meeting outside the camp.
8And whenever Moses went out to the
tent, all the people rose and stood at the
entrances to their tents, watching Moses
until he entered the tent.
9As Moses went into the tent, the pillar
of cloud would come down and stay at
the entrance, while the Lord spoke with
Moses.
10Whenever the people saw the pillar of
cloud standing at the entrance to the
tent, they all stood and worshiped, each
at the entrance to his tent.
11The Lord would speak to Moses face
to face, as a man speaks with his friend.
Then Moses would return to the camp,
but his young aide Joshua son of Nun
did not leave the tent.
12Moses said to the Lord , "You have
been telling me, 'Lead these people,' but
you have not let me know whom you will
send with me. You have said, 'I know
you by name and you have found favor
with me.'
13If you are pleased with me, teach me
your ways so I may know you and
continue to find favor with you.
Remember that this nation is your
people."
14The Lord replied, "My Presence will go
with you, and I will give you rest."
15Then Moses said to him, "If your
Presence does not go with us, do not
send us up from here.
16How will anyone know that you are
pleased with me and with your people
unless you go with us? What else will
distinguish me and your people from all
the other people on the face of the
earth?"
17And the Lord said to Moses, "I will do
the very thing you have asked, because
I am pleased with you and I know you
by name."
18Then Moses said, "Now show me your
glory."
19And the Lord said, "I will cause all my
goodness to pass in front of you, and I
will proclaim my name, the Lord , in your
presence. I will have mercy on whom I
will have mercy, and I will have
compassion on whom I will have
compassion.
20But," he said, "you cannot see my face,
for no one may see me and live."
21Then the Lord said, "There is a place
near me where you may stand on a rock.
22When my glory passes by, I will put
you in a cleft in the rock and cover you
with my hand until I have passed by.
23Then I will remove my hand and you
will see my back; but my face must not
be seen."
34The Lord said to Moses, "Chisel
out two stone tablets like the first ones,
and I will write on them the words that
were on the first tablets, which you
broke.
2Be ready in the morning, and then
come up on Mount Sinai. Present
yourself to me there on top of the
mountain.
3No one is to come with you or be seen
anywhere on the mountain; not even the
flocks and herds may graze in front of
the mountain."
4So Moses chiseled out two stone
tablets like the first ones and went up
Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the
Lord had commanded him; and he
carried the two stone tablets in his
hands.
5Then the Lord came down in the cloud
and stood there with him and
proclaimed his name, the Lord .
6And he passed in front of Moses,
proclaiming, "The Lord , the Lord , the
compassionate and gracious God, slow
to anger, abounding in love and
faithfulness,
7maintaining love to thousands, and
forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin.
Yet he does not leave the guilty
unpunished; he punishes the children
and their children for the sin of the
fathers to the third and fourth
generation."
8Moses bowed to the ground at once
and worshiped.
9"O Lord, if I have found favor in your
eyes," he said, "then let the Lord go with
us. Although this is a stiff-necked people,
forgive our wickedness and our sin, and
take us as your inheritance."
10Then the Lord said: "I am making a
covenant with you. Before all your
people I will do wonders never before
done in any nation in all the world. The
people you live among will see how
awesome is the work that I, the Lord ,
will do for you.
11Obey what I command you today. I will
drive out before you the Amorites,
Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites
and Jebusites.
12Be careful not to make a treaty with
those who live in the land where you are
going, or they will be a snare among you.
13Break down their altars, smash their
sacred stones and cut down their
Asherah poles.
14Do not worship any other god, for the
Lord , whose name is Jealous, is a
jealous God.
15"Be careful not to make a treaty with
those who live in the land; for when they
prostitute themselves to their gods and
sacrifice to them, they will invite you and
you will eat their sacrifices.
16And when you choose some of their
daughters as wives for your sons and
those daughters prostitute themselves
to their gods, they will lead your sons to
do the same.
17"Do not make cast idols.
18"Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened
Bread. For seven days eat bread made
without yeast, as I commanded you. Do
this at the appointed time in the month
of Abib, for in that month you came out
of Egypt.
19"The first offspring of every womb
belongs to me, including all the firstborn
males of your livestock, whether from
herd or flock.
20Redeem the firstborn donkey with a
lamb, but if you do not redeem it, break
its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons.
"No one is to appear before me emptyhanded.
21"Six days you shall labor, but on the
seventh day you shall rest; even during
the plowing season and harvest you
must rest.
22"Celebrate the Feast of Weeks with
the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and
the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of
the year.
23Three times a year all your men are to
appear before the Sovereign Lord , the
God of Israel.
24I will drive out nations before you and
enlarge your territory, and no one will
covet your land when you go up three
times each year to appear before the
Lord your God.
25"Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to
me along with anything containing yeast,
and do not let any of the sacrifice from
the Passover Feast remain until morning.
26"Bring the best of the firstfruits of your
soil to the house of the Lord your God.
"Do not cook a young goat in its
mother's milk."
27Then the Lord said to Moses, "Write
down these words, for in accordance
with these words I have made a
covenant with you and with Israel."
28Moses was there with the Lord forty
days and forty nights without eating
bread or drinking water. And he wrote
on the tablets the words of the
covenant-the Ten Commandments.
29When Moses came down from Mount
Sinai with the two tablets of the
Testimony in his hands, he was not
aware that his face was radiant because
he had spoken with the Lord .
30When Aaron and all the Israelites saw
Moses, his face was radiant, and they
were afraid to come near him.
31But Moses called to them; so Aaron
and all the leaders of the community
came back to him, and he spoke to
them.
32Afterward all the Israelites came near
him, and he gave them all the
commands the Lord had given him on
Mount Sinai.
33When Moses finished speaking to
them, he put a veil over his face.
34But whenever he entered the Lord 's
presence to speak with him, he removed
the veil until he came out. And when he
came out and told the Israelites what he
had been commanded,
35they saw that his face was radiant.
Then Moses would put the veil back
over his face until he went in to speak
with the Lord .
35Moses assembled the whole
Israelite community and said to them,
"These are the things the Lord has
commanded you to do:
2For six days, work is to be done, but
the seventh day shall be your holy day,
a Sabbath of rest to the Lord . Whoever
does any work on it must be put to
death.
3Do not light a fire in any of your
dwellings on the Sabbath day."
4Moses said to the whole Israelite
community, "This is what the Lord has
commanded:
5From what you have, take an offering
for the Lord . Everyone who is willing is
to bring to the Lord an offering of gold,
silver and bronze;
6blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine
linen; goat hair;
7ram skins dyed red and hides of sea
cows ; acacia wood;
8olive oil for the light; spices for the
anointing oil and for the fragrant
incense;
9and onyx stones and other gems to be
mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
10"All who are skilled among you are to
come and make everything the Lord has
commanded:
11the tabernacle with its tent and its
covering, clasps, frames, crossbars,
posts and bases;
12the ark with its poles and the
atonement cover and the curtain that
shields it;
13the table with its poles and all its
articles and the bread of the Presence;
14the lampstand that is for light with its
accessories, lamps and oil for the light;
15the altar of incense with its poles, the
anointing oil and the fragrant incense;
the curtain for the doorway at the
entrance to the tabernacle;
16the altar of burnt offering with its
bronze grating, its poles and all its
utensils; the bronze basin with its stand;
17the curtains of the courtyard with its
posts and bases, and the curtain for the
entrance to the courtyard;
18the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for
the courtyard, and their ropes;
19the woven garments worn for
ministering in the sanctuary-both the
sacred garments for Aaron the priest
and the garments for his sons when
they serve as priests."
20Then the whole Israelite community
withdrew from Moses' presence,
21and everyone who was willing and
whose heart moved him came and
brought an offering to the Lord for the
work on the Tent of Meeting, for all its
service, and for the sacred garments.
22All who were willing, men and women
alike, came and brought gold jewelry of
all kinds: brooches, earrings, rings and
ornaments. They all presented their gold
as a wave offering to the Lord .
23Everyone who had blue, purple or
scarlet yarn or fine linen, or goat hair,
ram skins dyed red or hides of sea cows
brought them.
24Those presenting an offering of silver
or bronze brought it as an offering to the
Lord , and everyone who had acacia
wood for any part of the work brought it.
25Every skilled woman spun with her
hands and brought what she had spunblue,
purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen.
26And all the women who were willing
and had the skill spun the goat hair.
27The leaders brought onyx stones and
other gems to be mounted on the ephod
and breastpiece.
28They also brought spices and olive oil
for the light and for the anointing oil and
for the fragrant incense.
29All the Israelite men and women who
were willing brought to the Lord freewill
offerings for all the work the Lord
through Moses had commanded them to
do.
30Then Moses said to the Israelites,
"See, the Lord has chosen Bezalel son
of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of
Judah,
31and he has filled him with the Spirit of
God, with skill, ability and knowledge in
all kinds of crafts-
32to make artistic designs for work in
gold, silver and bronze,
33to cut and set stones, to work in wood
and to engage in all kinds of artistic
craftsmanship.
34And he has given both him and
Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe
of Dan, the ability to teach others.
35He has filled them with skill to do all
kinds of work as craftsmen, designers,
embroiderers in blue, purple and scarlet
yarn and fine linen, and weavers-all of
them master craftsmen and designers.
36So Bezalel, Oholiab and every
skilled person to whom the Lord has
given skill and ability to know how to
carry out all the work of constructing the
sanctuary are to do the work just as the
Lord has commanded."
2Then Moses summoned Bezalel and
Oholiab and every skilled person to
whom the Lord had given ability and
who was willing to come and do the
work.
3They received from Moses all the
offerings the Israelites had brought to
carry out the work of constructing the
sanctuary. And the people continued to
bring freewill offerings morning after
morning.
4So all the skilled craftsmen who were
doing all the work on the sanctuary left
their work
5and said to Moses, "The people are
bringing more than enough for doing the
work the Lord commanded to be done."
6Then Moses gave an order and they
sent this word throughout the camp: "No
man or woman is to make anything else
as an offering for the sanctuary." And so
the people were restrained from bringing
more,
7because what they already had was
more than enough to do all the work.
8All the skilled men among the workmen
made the tabernacle with ten curtains of
finely twisted linen and blue, purple and
scarlet yarn, with cherubim worked into
them by a skilled craftsman.
9All the curtains were the same sizetwenty-
eight cubits long and four cubits
wide.
10They joined five of the curtains
together and did the same with the other
five.
11Then they made loops of blue material
along the edge of the end curtain in one
set, and the same was done with the
end curtain in the other set.
12They also made fifty loops on one
curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain
of the other set, with the loops opposite
each other.
13Then they made fifty gold clasps and
used them to fasten the two sets of
curtains together so that the tabernacle
was a unit.
14They made curtains of goat hair for the
tent over the tabernacle-eleven
altogether.
15All eleven curtains were the same
size-thirty cubits long and four cubits
wide.
16They joined five of the curtains into
one set and the other six into another
set.
17Then they made fifty loops along the
edge of the end curtain in one set and
also along the edge of the end curtain in
the other set.
18They made fifty bronze clasps to
fasten the tent together as a unit.
19Then they made for the tent a covering
of ram skins dyed red, and over that a
covering of hides of sea cows.
20They made upright frames of acacia
wood for the tabernacle.
21Each frame was ten cubits long and a
cubit and a half wide,
22with two projections set parallel to
each other. They made all the frames of
the tabernacle in this way.
23They made twenty frames for the
south side of the tabernacle
24and made forty silver bases to go
under them-two bases for each frame,
one under each projection.
25For the other side, the north side of the
tabernacle, they made twenty frames
26and forty silver bases-two under each
frame.
27They made six frames for the far end,
that is, the west end of the tabernacle,
28and two frames were made for the
corners of the tabernacle at the far end.
29At these two corners the frames were
double from the bottom all the way to
the top and fitted into a single ring; both
were made alike.
30So there were eight frames and
sixteen silver bases-two under each
frame.
31They also made crossbars of acacia
wood: five for the frames on one side of
the tabernacle,
32five for those on the other side, and
five for the frames on the west, at the far
end of the tabernacle.
33They made the center crossbar so that
it extended from end to end at the
middle of the frames.
34They overlaid the frames with gold and
made gold rings to hold the crossbars.
They also overlaid the crossbars with
gold.
35They made the curtain of blue, purple
and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen,
with cherubim worked into it by a skilled
craftsman.
36They made four posts of acacia wood
for it and overlaid them with gold. They
made gold hooks for them and cast their
four silver bases.
37For the entrance to the tent they made
a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn
and finely twisted linen-the work of an
embroiderer;
38and they made five posts with hooks
for them. They overlaid the tops of the
posts and their bands with gold and
made their five bases of bronze.
37Bezalel made the ark of acacia
wood-two and a half cubits long, a cubit
and a half wide, and a cubit and a half
high.
2He overlaid it with pure gold, both
inside and out, and made a gold
molding around it.
3He cast four gold rings for it and
fastened them to its four feet, with two
rings on one side and two rings on the
other.
4Then he made poles of acacia wood
and overlaid them with gold.
5And he inserted the poles into the rings
on the sides of the ark to carry it.
6He made the atonement cover of pure
gold-two and a half cubits long and a
cubit and a half wide.
7Then he made two cherubim out of
hammered gold at the ends of the cover.
8He made one cherub on one end and
the second cherub on the other; at the
two ends he made them of one piece
with the cover.
9The cherubim had their wings spread
upward, overshadowing the cover with
them. The cherubim faced each other,
looking toward the cover.
10They made the table of acacia woodtwo
cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit
and a half high.
11Then they overlaid it with pure gold
and made a gold molding around it.
12They also made around it a rim a
handbreadth wide and put a gold
molding on the rim.
13They cast four gold rings for the table
and fastened them to the four corners,
where the four legs were.
14The rings were put close to the rim to
hold the poles used in carrying the table.
15The poles for carrying the table were
made of acacia wood and were overlaid
with gold.
16And they made from pure gold the
articles for the table-its plates and
dishes and bowls and its pitchers for the
pouring out of drink offerings.
17They made the lampstand of pure gold
and hammered it out, base and shaft; its
flowerlike cups, buds and blossoms
were of one piece with it.
18Six branches extended from the sides
of the lampstand-three on one side and
three on the other.
19Three cups shaped like almond
flowers with buds and blossoms were on
one branch, three on the next branch
and the same for all six branches
extending from the lampstand.
20And on the lampstand were four cups
shaped like almond flowers with buds
and blossoms.
21One bud was under the first pair of
branches extending from the lampstand,
a second bud under the second pair,
and a third bud under the third pair-six
branches in all.
22The buds and the branches were all of
one piece with the lampstand,
hammered out of pure gold.
23They made its seven lamps, as well as
its wick trimmers and trays, of pure gold.
24They made the lampstand and all its
accessories from one talent of pure gold.
25They made the altar of incense out of
acacia wood. It was square, a cubit long
and a cubit wide, and two cubits high -its
horns of one piece with it.
26They overlaid the top and all the sides
and the horns with pure gold, and made
a gold molding around it.
27They made two gold rings below the
molding-two on opposite sides-to hold
the poles used to carry it.
28They made the poles of acacia wood
and overlaid them with gold.
29They also made the sacred anointing
oil and the pure, fragrant incense-the
work of a perfumer.
38They built the altar of burnt
offering of acacia wood, three cubits
high; it was square, five cubits long and
five cubits wide.
2They made a horn at each of the four
corners, so that the horns and the altar
were of one piece, and they overlaid the
altar with bronze.
3They made all its utensils of bronze-its
pots, shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat
forks and firepans.
4They made a grating for the altar, a
bronze network, to be under its ledge,
halfway up the altar.
5They cast bronze rings to hold the
poles for the four corners of the bronze
grating.
6They made the poles of acacia wood
and overlaid them with bronze.
7They inserted the poles into the rings
so they would be on the sides of the
altar for carrying it. They made it hollow,
out of boards.
8They made the bronze basin and its
bronze stand from the mirrors of the
women who served at the entrance to
the Tent of Meeting.
9Next they made the courtyard. The
south side was a hundred cubits long
and had curtains of finely twisted linen,
10with twenty posts and twenty bronze
bases, and with silver hooks and bands
on the posts.
11The north side was also a hundred
cubits long and had twenty posts and
twenty bronze bases, with silver hooks
and bands on the posts.
12The west end was fifty cubits wide and
had curtains, with ten posts and ten
bases, with silver hooks and bands on
the posts.
13The east end, toward the sunrise, was
also fifty cubits wide.
14Curtains fifteen cubits long were on
one side of the entrance, with three
posts and three bases,
15and curtains fifteen cubits long were
on the other side of the entrance to the
courtyard, with three posts and three
bases.
16All the curtains around the courtyard
were of finely twisted linen.
17The bases for the posts were bronze.
The hooks and bands on the posts were
silver, and their tops were overlaid with
silver; so all the posts of the courtyard
had silver bands.
18The curtain for the entrance to the
courtyard was of blue, purple and
scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen-the
work of an embroiderer. It was twenty
cubits long and, like the curtains of the
courtyard, five cubits high,
19with four posts and four bronze bases.
Their hooks and bands were silver, and
their tops were overlaid with silver.
20All the tent pegs of the tabernacle and
of the surrounding courtyard were
bronze.
21These are the amounts of the
materials used for the tabernacle, the
tabernacle of the Testimony, which were
recorded at Moses' command by the
Levites under the direction of Ithamar
son of Aaron, the priest.
22(Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of
the tribe of Judah, made everything the
Lord commanded Moses;
23with him was Oholiab son of
Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan-a
craftsman and designer, and an
embroiderer in blue, purple and scarlet
yarn and fine linen.)
24The total amount of the gold from the
wave offering used for all the work on
the sanctuary was 29 talents and 730
shekels, according to the sanctuary
shekel.
25The silver obtained from those of the
community who were counted in the
census was 100 talents and 1,775
shekels, according to the sanctuary
shekel-
26one beka per person, that is, half a
shekel, according to the sanctuary
shekel, from everyone who had crossed
over to those counted, twenty years old
or more, a total of 603,550 men.
27The 100 talents of silver were used to
cast the bases for the sanctuary and for
the curtain-100 bases from the 100
talents, one talent for each base.
28They used the 1,775 shekels to make
the hooks for the posts, to overlay the
tops of the posts, and to make their
bands.
29The bronze from the wave offering
was 70 talents and 2,400 shekels.
30They used it to make the bases for the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the
bronze altar with its bronze grating and
all its utensils,
31the bases for the surrounding
courtyard and those for its entrance and
all the tent pegs for the tabernacle and
those for the surrounding courtyard.
39From the blue, purple and scarlet
yarn they made woven garments for
ministering in the sanctuary. They also
made sacred garments for Aaron, as the
Lord commanded Moses.
2They made the ephod of gold, and of
blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of
finely twisted linen.
3They hammered out thin sheets of gold
and cut strands to be worked into the
blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine
linen-the work of a skilled craftsman.
4They made shoulder pieces for the
ephod, which were attached to two of its
corners, so it could be fastened.
5Its skillfully woven waistband was like
it-of one piece with the ephod and made
with gold, and with blue, purple and
scarlet yarn, and with finely twisted linen,
as the Lord commanded Moses.
6They mounted the onyx stones in gold
filigree settings and engraved them like
a seal with the names of the sons of
Israel.
7Then they fastened them on the
shoulder pieces of the ephod as
memorial stones for the sons of Israel,
as the Lord commanded Moses.
8They fashioned the breastpiece-the
work of a skilled craftsman. They made
it like the ephod: of gold, and of blue,
purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely
twisted linen.
9It was square-a span long and a span
wide-and folded double.
10Then they mounted four rows of
precious stones on it. In the first row
there was a ruby, a topaz and a beryl;
11in the second row a turquoise, a
sapphire and an emerald;
12in the third row a jacinth, an agate and
an amethyst;
13in the fourth row a chrysolite, an onyx
and a jasper. They were mounted in
gold filigree settings.
14There were twelve stones, one for
each of the names of the sons of Israel,
each engraved like a seal with the name
of one of the twelve tribes.
15For the breastpiece they made braided
chains of pure gold, like a rope.
16They made two gold filigree settings
and two gold rings, and fastened the
rings to two of the corners of the
breastpiece.
17They fastened the two gold chains to
the rings at the corners of the
breastpiece,
18and the other ends of the chains to the
two settings, attaching them to the
shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.
19They made two gold rings and
attached them to the other two corners
of the breastpiece on the inside edge
next to the ephod.
20Then they made two more gold rings
and attached them to the bottom of the
shoulder pieces on the front of the
ephod, close to the seam just above the
waistband of the ephod.
21They tied the rings of the breastpiece
to the rings of the ephod with blue cord,
connecting it to the waistband so that
the breastpiece would not swing out
from the ephod-as the Lord commanded
Moses.
22They made the robe of the ephod
entirely of blue cloth-the work of a
weaver-
23with an opening in the center of the
robe like the opening of a collar, and a
band around this opening, so that it
would not tear.
24They made pomegranates of blue,
purple and scarlet yarn and finely
twisted linen around the hem of the robe.
25And they made bells of pure gold and
attached them around the hem between
the pomegranates.
26The bells and pomegranates
alternated around the hem of the robe to
be worn for ministering, as the Lord
commanded Moses.
27For Aaron and his sons, they made
tunics of fine linen-the work of a weaver-
28and the turban of fine linen, the linen
headbands and the undergarments of
finely twisted linen.
29The sash was of finely twisted linen
and blue, purple and scarlet yarn-the
work of an embroiderer-as the Lord
commanded Moses.
30They made the plate, the sacred
diadem, out of pure gold and engraved
on it, like an inscription on a seal: HOLY
TO THE Lord .
31Then they fastened a blue cord to it to
attach it to the turban, as the Lord
commanded Moses.
32So all the work on the tabernacle, the
Tent of Meeting, was completed. The
Israelites did everything just as the Lord
commanded Moses.
33Then they brought the tabernacle to
Moses: the tent and all its furnishings,
its clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and
bases;
34the covering of ram skins dyed red, the
covering of hides of sea cows and the
shielding curtain;
35the ark of the Testimony with its poles
and the atonement cover;
36the table with all its articles and the
bread of the Presence;
37the pure gold lampstand with its row of
lamps and all its accessories, and the oil
for the light;
38the gold altar, the anointing oil, the
fragrant incense, and the curtain for the
entrance to the tent;
39the bronze altar with its bronze grating,
its poles and all its utensils; the basin
with its stand;
40the curtains of the courtyard with its
posts and bases, and the curtain for the
entrance to the courtyard; the ropes and
tent pegs for the courtyard; all the
furnishings for the tabernacle, the Tent
of Meeting;
41and the woven garments worn for
ministering in the sanctuary, both the
sacred garments for Aaron the priest
and the garments for his sons when
serving as priests.
42The Israelites had done all the work
just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
43Moses inspected the work and saw
that they had done it just as the Lord
had commanded. So Moses blessed
them.
40Then the Lord said to Moses:
2"Set up the tabernacle, the Tent of
Meeting, on the first day of the first
month.
3Place the ark of the Testimony in it and
shield the ark with the curtain.
4Bring in the table and set out what
belongs on it. Then bring in the
lampstand and set up its lamps.
5Place the gold altar of incense in front
of the ark of the Testimony and put the
curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
6"Place the altar of burnt offering in front
of the entrance to the tabernacle, the
Tent of Meeting;
7place the basin between the Tent of
Meeting and the altar and put water in it.
8Set up the courtyard around it and put
the curtain at the entrance to the
courtyard.
9"Take the anointing oil and anoint the
tabernacle and everything in it;
consecrate it and all its furnishings, and
it will be holy.
10Then anoint the altar of burnt offering
and all its utensils; consecrate the altar,
and it will be most holy.
11Anoint the basin and its stand and
consecrate them.
12"Bring Aaron and his sons to the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting and
wash them with water.
13Then dress Aaron in the sacred
garments, anoint him and consecrate
him so he may serve me as priest.
14Bring his sons and dress them in
tunics.
15Anoint them just as you anointed their
father, so they may serve me as priests.
Their anointing will be to a priesthood
that will continue for all generations to
come."
16Moses did everything just as the Lord
commanded him.
17So the tabernacle was set up on the
first day of the first month in the second
year.
18When Moses set up the tabernacle, he
put the bases in place, erected the
frames, inserted the crossbars and set
up the posts.
19Then he spread the tent over the
tabernacle and put the covering over the
tent, as the Lord commanded him.
20He took the Testimony and placed it in
the ark, attached the poles to the ark
and put the atonement cover over it.
21Then he brought the ark into the
tabernacle and hung the shielding
curtain and shielded the ark of the
Testimony, as the Lord commanded him.
22Moses placed the table in the Tent of
Meeting on the north side of the
tabernacle outside the curtain
23and set out the bread on it before the
Lord , as the Lord commanded him.
24He placed the lampstand in the Tent of
Meeting opposite the table on the south
side of the tabernacle
25and set up the lamps before the Lord ,
as the Lord commanded him.
26Moses placed the gold altar in the Tent
of Meeting in front of the curtain
27and burned fragrant incense on it, as
the Lord commanded him.
28Then he put up the curtain at the
entrance to the tabernacle.
29He set the altar of burnt offering near
the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent
of Meeting, and offered on it burnt
offerings and grain offerings, as the Lord
commanded him.
30He placed the basin between the Tent
of Meeting and the altar and put water in
it for washing,
31and Moses and Aaron and his sons
used it to wash their hands and feet.
32They washed whenever they entered
the Tent of Meeting or approached the
altar, as the Lord commanded Moses.
33Then Moses set up the courtyard
around the tabernacle and altar and put
up the curtain at the entrance to the
courtyard. And so Moses finished the
work. The Glory of the Lord
34Then the cloud covered the Tent of
Meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled
the tabernacle.
35Moses could not enter the Tent of
Meeting because the cloud had settled
upon it, and the glory of the Lord filled
the tabernacle.
36In all the travels of the Israelites,
whenever the cloud lifted from above
the tabernacle, they would set out;
37but if the cloud did not lift, they did not
set out-until the day it lifted.
38So the cloud of the Lord was over the
tabernacle by day, and fire was in the
cloud by night, in the sight of all the
house of Israel during all their travels.
Leviticus
1The Lord called to Moses and spoke
to him from the Tent of Meeting. He said,
2"Speak to the Israelites and say to
them: 'When any of you brings an
offering to the Lord , bring as your
offering an animal from either the herd
or the flock.
3" 'If the offering is a burnt offering from
the herd, he is to offer a male without
defect. He must present it at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting so that it
will be acceptable to the Lord .
4He is to lay his hand on the head of the
burnt offering, and it will be accepted on
his behalf to make atonement for him.
5He is to slaughter the young bull before
the Lord , and then Aaron's sons the
priests shall bring the blood and sprinkle
it against the altar on all sides at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
6He is to skin the burnt offering and cut it
into pieces.
7The sons of Aaron the priest are to put
fire on the altar and arrange wood on
the fire.
8Then Aaron's sons the priests shall
arrange the pieces, including the head
and the fat, on the burning wood that is
on the altar.
9He is to wash the inner parts and the
legs with water, and the priest is to burn
all of it on the altar. It is a burnt offering,
an offering made by fire, an aroma
pleasing to the Lord .
10" 'If the offering is a burnt offering from
the flock, from either the sheep or the
goats, he is to offer a male without
defect.
11He is to slaughter it at the north side of
the altar before the Lord , and Aaron's
sons the priests shall sprinkle its blood
against the altar on all sides.
12He is to cut it into pieces, and the
priest shall arrange them, including the
head and the fat, on the burning wood
that is on the altar.
13He is to wash the inner parts and the
legs with water, and the priest is to bring
all of it and burn it on the altar. It is a
burnt offering, an offering made by fire,
an aroma pleasing to the Lord .
14" 'If the offering to the Lord is a burnt
offering of birds, he is to offer a dove or
a young pigeon.
15The priest shall bring it to the altar,
wring off the head and burn it on the
altar; its blood shall be drained out on
the side of the altar.
16He is to remove the crop with its
contents and throw it to the east side of
the altar, where the ashes are.
17He shall tear it open by the wings, not
severing it completely, and then the
priest shall burn it on the wood that is on
the fire on the altar. It is a burnt offering,
an offering made by fire, an aroma
pleasing to the Lord .
2" 'When someone brings a grain
offering to the Lord , his offering is to be
of fine flour. He is to pour oil on it, put
incense on it
2and take it to Aaron's sons the priests.
The priest shall take a handful of the
fine flour and oil, together with all the
incense, and burn this as a memorial
portion on the altar, an offering made by
fire, an aroma pleasing to the Lord .
3The rest of the grain offering belongs to
Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy
part of the offerings made to the Lord by
fire.
4" 'If you bring a grain offering baked in
an oven, it is to consist of fine flour:
cakes made without yeast and mixed
with oil, or wafers made without yeast
and spread with oil.
5If your grain offering is prepared on a
griddle, it is to be made of fine flour
mixed with oil, and without yeast.
6Crumble it and pour oil on it; it is a grain
offering.
7If your grain offering is cooked in a pan,
it is to be made of fine flour and oil.
8Bring the grain offering made of these
things to the Lord ; present it to the
priest, who shall take it to the altar.
9He shall take out the memorial portion
from the grain offering and burn it on the
altar as an offering made by fire, an
aroma pleasing to the Lord .
10The rest of the grain offering belongs
to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy
part of the offerings made to the Lord by
fire.
11" 'Every grain offering you bring to the
Lord must be made without yeast, for
you are not to burn any yeast or honey
in an offering made to the Lord by fire.
12You may bring them to the Lord as an
offering of the firstfruits, but they are not
to be offered on the altar as a pleasing
aroma.
13Season all your grain offerings with
salt. Do not leave the salt of the
covenant of your God out of your grain
offerings; add salt to all your offerings.
14" 'If you bring a grain offering of
firstfruits to the Lord , offer crushed
heads of new grain roasted in the fire.
15Put oil and incense on it; it is a grain
offering.
16The priest shall burn the memorial
portion of the crushed grain and the oil,
together with all the incense, as an
offering made to the Lord by fire.
3" 'If someone's offering is a fellowship
offering, and he offers an animal from
the herd, whether male or female, he is
to present before the Lord an animal
without defect.
2He is to lay his hand on the head of his
offering and slaughter it at the entrance
to the Tent of Meeting. Then Aaron's
sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood
against the altar on all sides.
3From the fellowship offering he is to
bring a sacrifice made to the Lord by
fire: all the fat that covers the inner parts
or is connected to them,
4both kidneys with the fat on them near
the loins, and the covering of the liver,
which he will remove with the kidneys.
5Then Aaron's sons are to burn it on the
altar on top of the burnt offering that is
on the burning wood, as an offering
made by fire, an aroma pleasing to the
Lord .
6" 'If he offers an animal from the flock
as a fellowship offering to the Lord , he
is to offer a male or female without
defect.
7If he offers a lamb, he is to present it
before the Lord .
8He is to lay his hand on the head of his
offering and slaughter it in front of the
Tent of Meeting. Then Aaron's sons
shall sprinkle its blood against the altar
on all sides.
9From the fellowship offering he is to
bring a sacrifice made to the Lord by
fire: its fat, the entire fat tail cut off close
to the backbone, all the fat that covers
the inner parts or is connected to them,
10both kidneys with the fat on them near
the loins, and the covering of the liver,
which he will remove with the kidneys.
11The priest shall burn them on the altar
as food, an offering made to the Lord by
fire.
12" 'If his offering is a goat, he is to
present it before the Lord .
13He is to lay his hand on its head and
slaughter it in front of the Tent of
Meeting. Then Aaron's sons shall
sprinkle its blood against the altar on all
sides.
14From what he offers he is to make this
offering to the Lord by fire: all the fat that
covers the inner parts or is connected to
them,
15both kidneys with the fat on them near
the loins, and the covering of the liver,
which he will remove with the kidneys.
16The priest shall burn them on the altar
as food, an offering made by fire, a
pleasing aroma. All the fat is the Lord 's.
17" 'This is a lasting ordinance for the
generations to come, wherever you live:
You must not eat any fat or any blood.' "
4The Lord said to Moses,
2"Say to the Israelites: 'When anyone
sins unintentionally and does what is
forbidden in any of the Lord 's
commands-
3" 'If the anointed priest sins, bringing
guilt on the people, he must bring to the
Lord a young bull without defect as a sin
offering for the sin he has committed.
4He is to present the bull at the entrance
to the Tent of Meeting before the Lord .
He is to lay his hand on its head and
slaughter it before the Lord .
5Then the anointed priest shall take
some of the bull's blood and carry it into
the Tent of Meeting.
6He is to dip his finger into the blood and
sprinkle some of it seven times before
the Lord , in front of the curtain of the
sanctuary.
7The priest shall then put some of the
blood on the horns of the altar of
fragrant incense that is before the Lord
in the Tent of Meeting. The rest of the
bull's blood he shall pour out at the base
of the altar of burnt offering at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
8He shall remove all the fat from the bull
of the sin offering-the fat that covers the
inner parts or is connected to them,
9both kidneys with the fat on them near
the loins, and the covering of the liver,
which he will remove with the kidneys-
10just as the fat is removed from the ox
sacrificed as a fellowship offering. Then
the priest shall burn them on the altar of
burnt offering.
11But the hide of the bull and all its flesh,
as well as the head and legs, the inner
parts and offal-
12that is, all the rest of the bull-he must
take outside the camp to a place
ceremonially clean, where the ashes are
thrown, and burn it in a wood fire on the
ash heap.
13" 'If the whole Israelite community sins
unintentionally and does what is
forbidden in any of the Lord 's
commands, even though the community
is unaware of the matter, they are guilty.
14When they become aware of the sin
they committed, the assembly must
bring a young bull as a sin offering and
present it before the Tent of Meeting.
15The elders of the community are to lay
their hands on the bull's head before the
Lord , and the bull shall be slaughtered
before the Lord .
16Then the anointed priest is to take
some of the bull's blood into the Tent of
Meeting.
17He shall dip his finger into the blood
and sprinkle it before the Lord seven
times in front of the curtain.
18He is to put some of the blood on the
horns of the altar that is before the Lord
in the Tent of Meeting. The rest of the
blood he shall pour out at the base of
the altar of burnt offering at the entrance
to the Tent of Meeting.
19He shall remove all the fat from it and
burn it on the altar,
20and do with this bull just as he did with
the bull for the sin offering. In this way
the priest will make atonement for them,
and they will be forgiven.
21Then he shall take the bull outside the
camp and burn it as he burned the first
bull. This is the sin offering for the
community.
22" 'When a leader sins unintentionally
and does what is forbidden in any of the
commands of the Lord his God, he is
guilty.
23When he is made aware of the sin he
committed, he must bring as his offering
a male goat without defect.
24He is to lay his hand on the goat's
head and slaughter it at the place where
the burnt offering is slaughtered before
the Lord . It is a sin offering.
25Then the priest shall take some of the
blood of the sin offering with his finger
and put it on the horns of the altar of
burnt offering and pour out the rest of
the blood at the base of the altar.
26He shall burn all the fat on the altar as
he burned the fat of the fellowship
offering. In this way the priest will make
atonement for the man's sin, and he will
be forgiven.
27" 'If a member of the community sins
unintentionally and does what is
forbidden in any of the Lord 's
commands, he is guilty.
28When he is made aware of the sin he
committed, he must bring as his offering
for the sin he committed a female goat
without defect.
29He is to lay his hand on the head of
the sin offering and slaughter it at the
place of the burnt offering.
30Then the priest is to take some of the
blood with his finger and put it on the
horns of the altar of burnt offering and
pour out the rest of the blood at the
base of the altar.
31He shall remove all the fat, just as the
fat is removed from the fellowship
offering, and the priest shall burn it on
the altar as an aroma pleasing to the
Lord . In this way the priest will make
atonement for him, and he will be
forgiven.
32" 'If he brings a lamb as his sin offering,
he is to bring a female without defect.
33He is to lay his hand on its head and
slaughter it for a sin offering at the place
where the burnt offering is slaughtered.
34Then the priest shall take some of the
blood of the sin offering with his finger
and put it on the horns of the altar of
burnt offering and pour out the rest of
the blood at the base of the altar.
35He shall remove all the fat, just as the
fat is removed from the lamb of the
fellowship offering, and the priest shall
burn it on the altar on top of the
offerings made to the Lord by fire. In this
way the priest will make atonement for
him for the sin he has committed, and
he will be forgiven.
5" 'If a person sins because he does
not speak up when he hears a public
charge to testify regarding something he
has seen or learned about, he will be
held responsible.
2" 'Or if a person touches anything
ceremonially unclean-whether the
carcasses of unclean wild animals or of
unclean livestock or of unclean
creatures that move along the groundeven
though he is unaware of it, he has
become unclean and is guilty.
3" 'Or if he touches human uncleannessanything
that would make him uncleaneven
though he is unaware of it, when
he learns of it he will be guilty.
4" 'Or if a person thoughtlessly takes an
oath to do anything, whether good or
evil-in any matter one might carelessly
swear about-even though he is unaware
of it, in any case when he learns of it he
will be guilty.
5" 'When anyone is guilty in any of these
ways, he must confess in what way he
has sinned
6and, as a penalty for the sin he has
committed, he must bring to the Lord a
female lamb or goat from the flock as a
sin offering; and the priest shall make
atonement for him for his sin.
7" 'If he cannot afford a lamb, he is to
bring two doves or two young pigeons to
the Lord as a penalty for his sin-one for
a sin offering and the other for a burnt
offering.
8He is to bring them to the priest, who
shall first offer the one for the sin
offering. He is to wring its head from its
neck, not severing it completely,
9and is to sprinkle some of the blood of
the sin offering against the side of the
altar; the rest of the blood must be
drained out at the base of the altar. It is
a sin offering.
10The priest shall then offer the other as
a burnt offering in the prescribed way
and make atonement for him for the sin
he has committed, and he will be
forgiven.
11" 'If, however, he cannot afford two
doves or two young pigeons, he is to
bring as an offering for his sin a tenth of
an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering.
He must not put oil or incense on it,
because it is a sin offering.
12He is to bring it to the priest, who shall
take a handful of it as a memorial
portion and burn it on the altar on top of
the offerings made to the Lord by fire. It
is a sin offering.
13In this way the priest will make
atonement for him for any of these sins
he has committed, and he will be
forgiven. The rest of the offering will
belong to the priest, as in the case of
the grain offering.' "
14The Lord said to Moses:
15"When a person commits a violation
and sins unintentionally in regard to any
of the Lord 's holy things, he is to bring
to the Lord as a penalty a ram from the
flock, one without defect and of the
proper value in silver, according to the
sanctuary shekel. It is a guilt offering.
16He must make restitution for what he
has failed to do in regard to the holy
things, add a fifth of the value to that
and give it all to the priest, who will
make atonement for him with the ram as
a guilt offering, and he will be forgiven.
17"If a person sins and does what is
forbidden in any of the Lord 's
commands, even though he does not
know it, he is guilty and will be held
responsible.
18He is to bring to the priest as a guilt
offering a ram from the flock, one
without defect and of the proper value.
In this way the priest will make
atonement for him for the wrong he has
committed unintentionally, and he will be
forgiven.
19It is a guilt offering; he has been guilty
of wrongdoing against the Lord ."
6The Lord said to Moses:
2"If anyone sins and is unfaithful to the
Lord by deceiving his neighbor about
something entrusted to him or left in his
care or stolen, or if he cheats him,
3or if he finds lost property and lies
about it, or if he swears falsely, or if he
commits any such sin that people may
do-
4when he thus sins and becomes guilty,
he must return what he has stolen or
taken by extortion, or what was
entrusted to him, or the lost property he
found,
5or whatever it was he swore falsely
about. He must make restitution in full,
add a fifth of the value to it and give it all
to the owner on the day he presents his
guilt offering.
6And as a penalty he must bring to the
priest, that is, to the Lord , his guilt
offering, a ram from the flock, one
without defect and of the proper value.
7In this way the priest will make
atonement for him before the Lord , and
he will be forgiven for any of these
things he did that made him guilty."
8The Lord said to Moses:
9"Give Aaron and his sons this
command: 'These are the regulations for
the burnt offering: The burnt offering is
to remain on the altar hearth throughout
the night, till morning, and the fire must
be kept burning on the altar.
10The priest shall then put on his linen
clothes, with linen undergarments next
to his body, and shall remove the ashes
of the burnt offering that the fire has
consumed on the altar and place them
beside the altar.
11Then he is to take off these clothes
and put on others, and carry the ashes
outside the camp to a place that is
ceremonially clean.
12The fire on the altar must be kept
burning; it must not go out. Every
morning the priest is to add firewood
and arrange the burnt offering on the fire
and burn the fat of the fellowship
offerings on it.
13The fire must be kept burning on the
altar continuously; it must not go out.
14" 'These are the regulations for the
grain offering: Aaron's sons are to bring
it before the Lord , in front of the altar.
15The priest is to take a handful of fine
flour and oil, together with all the
incense on the grain offering, and burn
the memorial portion on the altar as an
aroma pleasing to the Lord .
16Aaron and his sons shall eat the rest
of it, but it is to be eaten without yeast in
a holy place; they are to eat it in the
courtyard of the Tent of Meeting.
17It must not be baked with yeast; I have
given it as their share of the offerings
made to me by fire. Like the sin offering
and the guilt offering, it is most holy.
18Any male descendant of Aaron may
eat it. It is his regular share of the
offerings made to the Lord by fire for the
generations to come. Whatever touches
them will become holy. ' "
19The Lord also said to Moses,
20"This is the offering Aaron and his
sons are to bring to the Lord on the day
he is anointed: a tenth of an ephah of
fine flour as a regular grain offering, half
of it in the morning and half in the
evening.
21Prepare it with oil on a griddle; bring it
well-mixed and present the grain
offering broken in pieces as an aroma
pleasing to the Lord .
22The son who is to succeed him as
anointed priest shall prepare it. It is the
Lord 's regular share and is to be burned
completely.
23Every grain offering of a priest shall be
burned completely; it must not be
eaten."
24The Lord said to Moses,
25"Say to Aaron and his sons: 'These
are the regulations for the sin offering:
The sin offering is to be slaughtered
before the Lord in the place the burnt
offering is slaughtered; it is most holy.
26The priest who offers it shall eat it; it is
to be eaten in a holy place, in the
courtyard of the Tent of Meeting.
27Whatever touches any of the flesh will
become holy, and if any of the blood is
spattered on a garment, you must wash
it in a holy place.
28The clay pot the meat is cooked in
must be broken; but if it is cooked in a
bronze pot, the pot is to be scoured and
rinsed with water.
29Any male in a priest's family may eat it;
it is most holy.
30But any sin offering whose blood is
brought into the Tent of Meeting to
make atonement in the Holy Place must
not be eaten; it must be burned.
7" 'These are the regulations for the
guilt offering, which is most holy:
2The guilt offering is to be slaughtered in
the place where the burnt offering is
slaughtered, and its blood is to be
sprinkled against the altar on all sides.
3All its fat shall be offered: the fat tail
and the fat that covers the inner parts,
4both kidneys with the fat on them near
the loins, and the covering of the liver,
which is to be removed with the kidneys.
5The priest shall burn them on the altar
as an offering made to the Lord by fire.
It is a guilt offering.
6Any male in a priest's family may eat it,
but it must be eaten in a holy place; it is
most holy.
7" 'The same law applies to both the sin
offering and the guilt offering: They
belong to the priest who makes
atonement with them.
8The priest who offers a burnt offering
for anyone may keep its hide for himself.
9Every grain offering baked in an oven
or cooked in a pan or on a griddle
belongs to the priest who offers it,
10and every grain offering, whether
mixed with oil or dry, belongs equally to
all the sons of Aaron.
11" 'These are the regulations for the
fellowship offering a person may present
to the Lord :
12" 'If he offers it as an expression of
thankfulness, then along with this thank
offering he is to offer cakes of bread
made without yeast and mixed with oil,
wafers made without yeast and spread
with oil, and cakes of fine flour wellkneaded
and mixed with oil.
13Along with his fellowship offering of
thanksgiving he is to present an offering
with cakes of bread made with yeast.
14He is to bring one of each kind as an
offering, a contribution to the Lord ; it
belongs to the priest who sprinkles the
blood of the fellowship offerings.
15The meat of his fellowship offering of
thanksgiving must be eaten on the day it
is offered; he must leave none of it till
morning.
16" 'If, however, his offering is the result
of a vow or is a freewill offering, the
sacrifice shall be eaten on the day he
offers it, but anything left over may be
eaten on the next day.
17Any meat of the sacrifice left over till
the third day must be burned up.
18If any meat of the fellowship offering is
eaten on the third day, it will not be
accepted. It will not be credited to the
one who offered it, for it is impure; the
person who eats any of it will be held
responsible.
19" 'Meat that touches anything
ceremonially unclean must not be eaten;
it must be burned up. As for other meat,
anyone ceremonially clean may eat it.
20But if anyone who is unclean eats any
meat of the fellowship offering belonging
to the Lord , that person must be cut off
from his people.
21If anyone touches something uncleanwhether
human uncleanness or an
unclean animal or any unclean,
detestable thing-and then eats any of
the meat of the fellowship offering
belonging to the Lord , that person must
be cut off from his people.' "
22The Lord said to Moses,
23"Say to the Israelites: 'Do not eat any
of the fat of cattle, sheep or goats.
24The fat of an animal found dead or
torn by wild animals may be used for
any other purpose, but you must not eat
it.
25Anyone who eats the fat of an animal
from which an offering by fire may be
made to the Lord must be cut off from
his people.
26And wherever you live, you must not
eat the blood of any bird or animal.
27If anyone eats blood, that person must
be cut off from his people.' "
28The Lord said to Moses,
29"Say to the Israelites: 'Anyone who
brings a fellowship offering to the Lord is
to bring part of it as his sacrifice to the
Lord .
30With his own hands he is to bring the
offering made to the Lord by fire; he is to
bring the fat, together with the breast,
and wave the breast before the Lord as
a wave offering.
31The priest shall burn the fat on the
altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron
and his sons.
32You are to give the right thigh of your
fellowship offerings to the priest as a
contribution.
33The son of Aaron who offers the blood
and the fat of the fellowship offering
shall have the right thigh as his share.
34From the fellowship offerings of the
Israelites, I have taken the breast that is
waved and the thigh that is presented
and have given them to Aaron the priest
and his sons as their regular share from
the Israelites.' "
35This is the portion of the offerings
made to the Lord by fire that were
allotted to Aaron and his sons on the
day they were presented to serve the
Lord as priests.
36On the day they were anointed, the
Lord commanded that the Israelites give
this to them as their regular share for
the generations to come.
37These, then, are the regulations for the
burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin
offering, the guilt offering, the ordination
offering and the fellowship offering,
38which the Lord gave Moses on Mount
Sinai on the day he commanded the
Israelites to bring their offerings to the
Lord , in the Desert of Sinai.
8The Lord said to Moses,
2"Bring Aaron and his sons, their
garments, the anointing oil, the bull for
the sin offering, the two rams and the
basket containing bread made without
yeast,
3and gather the entire assembly at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting."
4Moses did as the Lord commanded him,
and the assembly gathered at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
5Moses said to the assembly, "This is
what the Lord has commanded to be
done."
6Then Moses brought Aaron and his
sons forward and washed them with
water.
7He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash
around him, clothed him with the robe
and put the ephod on him. He also tied
the ephod to him by its skillfully woven
waistband; so it was fastened on him.
8He placed the breastpiece on him and
put the Urim and Thummim in the
breastpiece.
9Then he placed the turban on Aaron's
head and set the gold plate, the sacred
diadem, on the front of it, as the Lord
commanded Moses.
10Then Moses took the anointing oil and
anointed the tabernacle and everything
in it, and so consecrated them.
11He sprinkled some of the oil on the
altar seven times, anointing the altar
and all its utensils and the basin with its
stand, to consecrate them.
12He poured some of the anointing oil on
Aaron's head and anointed him to
consecrate him.
13Then he brought Aaron's sons forward,
put tunics on them, tied sashes around
them and put headbands on them, as
the Lord commanded Moses.
14He then presented the bull for the sin
offering, and Aaron and his sons laid
their hands on its head.
15Moses slaughtered the bull and took
some of the blood, and with his finger he
put it on all the horns of the altar to
purify the altar. He poured out the rest of
the blood at the base of the altar. So he
consecrated it to make atonement for it.
16Moses also took all the fat around the
inner parts, the covering of the liver, and
both kidneys and their fat, and burned it
on the altar.
17But the bull with its hide and its flesh
and its offal he burned up outside the
camp, as the Lord commanded Moses.
18He then presented the ram for the
burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons
laid their hands on its head.
19Then Moses slaughtered the ram and
sprinkled the blood against the altar on
all sides.
20He cut the ram into pieces and burned
the head, the pieces and the fat.
21He washed the inner parts and the
legs with water and burned the whole
ram on the altar as a burnt offering, a
pleasing aroma, an offering made to the
Lord by fire, as the Lord commanded
Moses.
22He then presented the other ram, the
ram for the ordination, and Aaron and
his sons laid their hands on its head.
23Moses slaughtered the ram and took
some of its blood and put it on the lobe
of Aaron's right ear, on the thumb of his
right hand and on the big toe of his right
foot.
24Moses also brought Aaron's sons
forward and put some of the blood on
the lobes of their right ears, on the
thumbs of their right hands and on the
big toes of their right feet. Then he
sprinkled blood against the altar on all
sides.
25He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat
around the inner parts, the covering of
the liver, both kidneys and their fat and
the right thigh.
26Then from the basket of bread made
without yeast, which was before the
Lord , he took a cake of bread, and one
made with oil, and a wafer; he put these
on the fat portions and on the right thigh.
27He put all these in the hands of Aaron
and his sons and waved them before
the Lord as a wave offering.
28Then Moses took them from their
hands and burned them on the altar on
top of the burnt offering as an ordination
offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering
made to the Lord by fire.
29He also took the breast-Moses' share
of the ordination ram-and waved it
before the Lord as a wave offering, as
the Lord commanded Moses.
30Then Moses took some of the
anointing oil and some of the blood from
the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron
and his garments and on his sons and
their garments. So he consecrated
Aaron and his garments and his sons
and their garments.
31Moses then said to Aaron and his sons,
"Cook the meat at the entrance to the
Tent of Meeting and eat it there with the
bread from the basket of ordination
offerings, as I commanded, saying,
'Aaron and his sons are to eat it.'
32Then burn up the rest of the meat and
the bread.
33Do not leave the entrance to the Tent
of Meeting for seven days, until the days
of your ordination are completed, for
your ordination will last seven days.
34What has been done today was
commanded by the Lord to make
atonement for you.
35You must stay at the entrance to the
Tent of Meeting day and night for seven
days and do what the Lord requires, so
you will not die; for that is what I have
been commanded."
36So Aaron and his sons did everything
the Lord commanded through Moses.
9On the eighth day Moses summoned
Aaron and his sons and the elders of
Israel.
2He said to Aaron, "Take a bull calf for
your sin offering and a ram for your
burnt offering, both without defect, and
present them before the Lord .
3Then say to the Israelites: 'Take a male
goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lambboth
a year old and without defect-for a
burnt offering,
4and an ox and a ram for a fellowship
offering to sacrifice before the Lord ,
together with a grain offering mixed with
oil. For today the Lord will appear to
you.' "
5They took the things Moses
commanded to the front of the Tent of
Meeting, and the entire assembly came
near and stood before the Lord .
6Then Moses said, "This is what the
Lord has commanded you to do, so that
the glory of the Lord may appear to
you."
7Moses said to Aaron, "Come to the
altar and sacrifice your sin offering and
your burnt offering and make atonement
for yourself and the people; sacrifice the
offering that is for the people and make
atonement for them, as the Lord has
commanded."
8So Aaron came to the altar and
slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for
himself.
9His sons brought the blood to him, and
he dipped his finger into the blood and
put it on the horns of the altar; the rest
of the blood he poured out at the base
of the altar.
10On the altar he burned the fat, the
kidneys and the covering of the liver
from the sin offering, as the Lord
commanded Moses;
11the flesh and the hide he burned up
outside the camp.
12Then he slaughtered the burnt offering.
His sons handed him the blood, and he
sprinkled it against the altar on all sides.
13They handed him the burnt offering
piece by piece, including the head, and
he burned them on the altar.
14He washed the inner parts and the
legs and burned them on top of the
burnt offering on the altar.
15Aaron then brought the offering that
was for the people. He took the goat for
the people's sin offering and slaughtered
it and offered it for a sin offering as he
did with the first one.
16He brought the burnt offering and
offered it in the prescribed way.
17He also brought the grain offering,
took a handful of it and burned it on the
altar in addition to the morning's burnt
offering.
18He slaughtered the ox and the ram as
the fellowship offering for the people.
His sons handed him the blood, and he
sprinkled it against the altar on all sides.
19But the fat portions of the ox and the
ram-the fat tail, the layer of fat, the
kidneys and the covering of the liver-
20these they laid on the breasts, and
then Aaron burned the fat on the altar.
21Aaron waved the breasts and the right
thigh before the Lord as a wave offering,
as Moses commanded.
22Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the
people and blessed them. And having
sacrificed the sin offering, the burnt
offering and the fellowship offering, he
stepped down.
23Moses and Aaron then went into the
Tent of Meeting. When they came out,
they blessed the people; and the glory
of the Lord appeared to all the people.
24Fire came out from the presence of the
Lord and consumed the burnt offering
and the fat portions on the altar. And
when all the people saw it, they shouted
for joy and fell facedown.
10Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu
took their censers, put fire in them and
added incense; and they offered
unauthorized fire before the Lord ,
contrary to his command.
2So fire came out from the presence of
the Lord and consumed them, and they
died before the Lord .
3Moses then said to Aaron, "This is what
the Lord spoke of when he said: "
'Among those who approach me I will
show myself holy; in the sight of all the
people I will be honored.' " Aaron
remained silent.
4Moses summoned Mishael and
Elzaphan, sons of Aaron's uncle Uzziel,
and said to them, "Come here; carry
your cousins outside the camp, away
from the front of the sanctuary."
5So they came and carried them, still in
their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses
ordered.
6Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons
Eleazar and Ithamar, "Do not let your
hair become unkempt, and do not tear
your clothes, or you will die and the Lord
will be angry with the whole community.
But your relatives, all the house of Israel,
may mourn for those the Lord has
destroyed by fire.
7Do not leave the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting or you will die, because the
Lord 's anointing oil is on you." So they
did as Moses said.
8Then the Lord said to Aaron,
9"You and your sons are not to drink
wine or other fermented drink whenever
you go into the Tent of Meeting, or you
will die. This is a lasting ordinance for
the generations to come.
10You must distinguish between the holy
and the common, between the unclean
and the clean,
11and you must teach the Israelites all
the decrees the Lord has given them
through Moses."
12Moses said to Aaron and his
remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar,
"Take the grain offering left over from
the offerings made to the Lord by fire
and eat it prepared without yeast beside
the altar, for it is most holy.
13Eat it in a holy place, because it is
your share and your sons' share of the
offerings made to the Lord by fire; for so
I have been commanded.
14But you and your sons and your
daughters may eat the breast that was
waved and the thigh that was presented.
Eat them in a ceremonially clean place;
they have been given to you and your
children as your share of the Israelites'
fellowship offerings.
15The thigh that was presented and the
breast that was waved must be brought
with the fat portions of the offerings
made by fire, to be waved before the
Lord as a wave offering. This will be the
regular share for you and your children,
as the Lord has commanded."
16When Moses inquired about the goat
of the sin offering and found that it had
been burned up, he was angry with
Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's remaining
sons, and asked,
17"Why didn't you eat the sin offering in
the sanctuary area? It is most holy; it
was given to you to take away the guilt
of the community by making atonement
for them before the Lord .
18Since its blood was not taken into the
Holy Place, you should have eaten the
goat in the sanctuary area, as I
commanded."
19Aaron replied to Moses, "Today they
sacrificed their sin offering and their
burnt offering before the Lord , but such
things as this have happened to me.
Would the Lord have been pleased if I
had eaten the sin offering today?"
20When Moses heard this, he was
satisfied.
11The Lord said to Moses and
Aaron,
2"Say to the Israelites: 'Of all the animals
that live on land, these are the ones you
may eat:
3You may eat any animal that has a split
hoof completely divided and that chews
the cud.
4" 'There are some that only chew the
cud or only have a split hoof, but you
must not eat them. The camel, though it
chews the cud, does not have a split
hoof; it is ceremonially unclean for you.
5The coney, though it chews the cud,
does not have a split hoof; it is unclean
for you.
6The rabbit, though it chews the cud,
does not have a split hoof; it is unclean
for you.
7And the pig, though it has a split hoof
completely divided, does not chew the
cud; it is unclean for you.
8You must not eat their meat or touch
their carcasses; they are unclean for
you.
9" 'Of all the creatures living in the water
of the seas and the streams, you may
eat any that have fins and scales.
10But all creatures in the seas or
streams that do not have fins and
scales-whether among all the swarming
things or among all the other living
creatures in the water-you are to detest.
11And since you are to detest them, you
must not eat their meat and you must
detest their carcasses.
12Anything living in the water that does
not have fins and scales is to be
detestable to you.
13" 'These are the birds you are to detest
and not eat because they are
detestable: the eagle, the vulture, the
black vulture,
14the red kite, any kind of black kite,
15any kind of raven,
16the horned owl, the screech owl, the
gull, any kind of hawk,
17the little owl, the cormorant, the great
owl,
18the white owl, the desert owl, the
osprey,
19the stork, any kind of heron, the
hoopoe and the bat.
20" 'All flying insects that walk on all
fours are to be detestable to you.
21There are, however, some winged
creatures that walk on all fours that you
may eat: those that have jointed legs for
hopping on the ground.
22Of these you may eat any kind of
locust, katydid, cricket or grasshopper.
23But all other winged creatures that
have four legs you are to detest.
24" 'You will make yourselves unclean by
these; whoever touches their carcasses
will be unclean till evening.
25Whoever picks up one of their
carcasses must wash his clothes, and
he will be unclean till evening.
26" 'Every animal that has a split hoof not
completely divided or that does not
chew the cud is unclean for you;
whoever touches the carcass of any of
them will be unclean.
27Of all the animals that walk on all fours,
those that walk on their paws are
unclean for you; whoever touches their
carcasses will be unclean till evening.
28Anyone who picks up their carcasses
must wash his clothes, and he will be
unclean till evening. They are unclean
for you.
29" 'Of the animals that move about on
the ground, these are unclean for you:
the weasel, the rat, any kind of great
lizard,
30the gecko, the monitor lizard, the wall
lizard, the skink and the chameleon.
31Of all those that move along the
ground, these are unclean for you.
Whoever touches them when they are
dead will be unclean till evening.
32When one of them dies and falls on
something, that article, whatever its use,
will be unclean, whether it is made of
wood, cloth, hide or sackcloth. Put it in
water; it will be unclean till evening, and
then it will be clean.
33If one of them falls into a clay pot,
everything in it will be unclean, and you
must break the pot.
34Any food that could be eaten but has
water on it from such a pot is unclean,
and any liquid that could be drunk from
it is unclean.
35Anything that one of their carcasses
falls on becomes unclean; an oven or
cooking pot must be broken up. They
are unclean, and you are to regard them
as unclean.
36A spring, however, or a cistern for
collecting water remains clean, but
anyone who touches one of these
carcasses is unclean.
37If a carcass falls on any seeds that are
to be planted, they remain clean.
38But if water has been put on the seed
and a carcass falls on it, it is unclean for
you.
39" 'If an animal that you are allowed to
eat dies, anyone who touches the
carcass will be unclean till evening.
40Anyone who eats some of the carcass
must wash his clothes, and he will be
unclean till evening. Anyone who picks
up the carcass must wash his clothes,
and he will be unclean till evening.
41" 'Every creature that moves about on
the ground is detestable; it is not to be
eaten.
42You are not to eat any creature that
moves about on the ground, whether it
moves on its belly or walks on all fours
or on many feet; it is detestable.
43Do not defile yourselves by any of
these creatures. Do not make
yourselves unclean by means of them or
be made unclean by them.
44I am the Lord your God; consecrate
yourselves and be holy, because I am
holy. Do not make yourselves unclean
by any creature that moves about on the
ground.
45I am the Lord who brought you up out
of Egypt to be your God; therefore be
holy, because I am holy.
46" 'These are the regulations
concerning animals, birds, every living
thing that moves in the water and every
creature that moves about on the
ground.
47You must distinguish between the
unclean and the clean, between living
creatures that may be eaten and those
that may not be eaten.' "
12The Lord said to Moses,
2"Say to the Israelites: 'A woman who
becomes pregnant and gives birth to a
son will be ceremonially unclean for
seven days, just as she is unclean
during her monthly period.
3On the eighth day the boy is to be
circumcised.
4Then the woman must wait thirty-three
days to be purified from her bleeding.
She must not touch anything sacred or
go to the sanctuary until the days of her
purification are over.
5If she gives birth to a daughter, for two
weeks the woman will be unclean, as
during her period. Then she must wait
sixty-six days to be purified from her
bleeding.
6" 'When the days of her purification for
a son or daughter are over, she is to
bring to the priest at the entrance to the
Tent of Meeting a year-old lamb for a
burnt offering and a young pigeon or a
dove for a sin offering.
7He shall offer them before the Lord to
make atonement for her, and then she
will be ceremonially clean from her flow
of blood. " 'These are the regulations for
the woman who gives birth to a boy or a
girl.
8If she cannot afford a lamb, she is to
bring two doves or two young pigeons,
one for a burnt offering and the other for
a sin offering. In this way the priest will
make atonement for her, and she will be
clean.' "
13The Lord said to Moses and
Aaron,
2"When anyone has a swelling or a rash
or a bright spot on his skin that may
become an infectious skin disease, he
must be brought to Aaron the priest or to
one of his sons who is a priest.
3The priest is to examine the sore on his
skin, and if the hair in the sore has
turned white and the sore appears to be
more than skin deep, it is an infectious
skin disease. When the priest examines
him, he shall pronounce him
ceremonially unclean.
4If the spot on his skin is white but does
not appear to be more than skin deep
and the hair in it has not turned white,
the priest is to put the infected person in
isolation for seven days.
5On the seventh day the priest is to
examine him, and if he sees that the
sore is unchanged and has not spread
in the skin, he is to keep him in isolation
another seven days.
6On the seventh day the priest is to
examine him again, and if the sore has
faded and has not spread in the skin,
the priest shall pronounce him clean; it
is only a rash. The man must wash his
clothes, and he will be clean.
7But if the rash does spread in his skin
after he has shown himself to the priest
to be pronounced clean, he must appear
before the priest again.
8The priest is to examine him, and if the
rash has spread in the skin, he shall
pronounce him unclean; it is an
infectious disease.
9"When anyone has an infectious skin
disease, he must be brought to the
priest.
10The priest is to examine him, and if
there is a white swelling in the skin that
has turned the hair white and if there is
raw flesh in the swelling,
11it is a chronic skin disease and the
priest shall pronounce him unclean. He
is not to put him in isolation, because he
is already unclean.
12"If the disease breaks out all over his
skin and, so far as the priest can see, it
covers all the skin of the infected person
from head to foot,
13the priest is to examine him, and if the
disease has covered his whole body, he
shall pronounce that person clean.
Since it has all turned white, he is clean.
14But whenever raw flesh appears on
him, he will be unclean.
15When the priest sees the raw flesh, he
shall pronounce him unclean. The raw
flesh is unclean; he has an infectious
disease.
16Should the raw flesh change and turn
white, he must go to the priest.
17The priest is to examine him, and if the
sores have turned white, the priest shall
pronounce the infected person clean;
then he will be clean.
18"When someone has a boil on his skin
and it heals,
19and in the place where the boil was, a
white swelling or reddish-white spot
appears, he must present himself to the
priest.
20The priest is to examine it, and if it
appears to be more than skin deep and
the hair in it has turned white, the priest
shall pronounce him unclean. It is an
infectious skin disease that has broken
out where the boil was.
21But if, when the priest examines it,
there is no white hair in it and it is not
more than skin deep and has faded,
then the priest is to put him in isolation
for seven days.
22If it is spreading in the skin, the priest
shall pronounce him unclean; it is
infectious.
23But if the spot is unchanged and has
not spread, it is only a scar from the boil,
and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
24"When someone has a burn on his
skin and a reddish-white or white spot
appears in the raw flesh of the burn,
25the priest is to examine the spot, and if
the hair in it has turned white, and it
appears to be more than skin deep, it is
an infectious disease that has broken
out in the burn. The priest shall
pronounce him unclean; it is an
infectious skin disease.
26But if the priest examines it and there
is no white hair in the spot and if it is not
more than skin deep and has faded,
then the priest is to put him in isolation
for seven days.
27On the seventh day the priest is to
examine him, and if it is spreading in the
skin, the priest shall pronounce him
unclean; it is an infectious skin disease.
28If, however, the spot is unchanged and
has not spread in the skin but has faded,
it is a swelling from the burn, and the
priest shall pronounce him clean; it is
only a scar from the burn.
29"If a man or woman has a sore on the
head or on the chin,
30the priest is to examine the sore, and if
it appears to be more than skin deep
and the hair in it is yellow and thin, the
priest shall pronounce that person
unclean; it is an itch, an infectious
disease of the head or chin.
31But if, when the priest examines this
kind of sore, it does not seem to be
more than skin deep and there is no
black hair in it, then the priest is to put
the infected person in isolation for seven
days.
32On the seventh day the priest is to
examine the sore, and if the itch has not
spread and there is no yellow hair in it
and it does not appear to be more than
skin deep,
33he must be shaved except for the
diseased area, and the priest is to keep
him in isolation another seven days.
34On the seventh day the priest is to
examine the itch, and if it has not spread
in the skin and appears to be no more
than skin deep, the priest shall
pronounce him clean. He must wash his
clothes, and he will be clean.
35But if the itch does spread in the skin
after he is pronounced clean,
36the priest is to examine him, and if the
itch has spread in the skin, the priest
does not need to look for yellow hair; the
person is unclean.
37If, however, in his judgment it is
unchanged and black hair has grown in
it, the itch is healed. He is clean, and the
priest shall pronounce him clean.
38"When a man or woman has white
spots on the skin,
39the priest is to examine them, and if
the spots are dull white, it is a harmless
rash that has broken out on the skin;
that person is clean.
40"When a man has lost his hair and is
bald, he is clean.
41If he has lost his hair from the front of
his scalp and has a bald forehead, he is
clean.
42But if he has a reddish-white sore on
his bald head or forehead, it is an
infectious disease breaking out on his
head or forehead.
43The priest is to examine him, and if the
swollen sore on his head or forehead is
reddish-white like an infectious skin
disease,
44the man is diseased and is unclean.
The priest shall pronounce him unclean
because of the sore on his head.
45"The person with such an infectious
disease must wear torn clothes, let his
hair be unkempt, cover the lower part of
his face and cry out, 'Unclean! Unclean!'
46As long as he has the infection he
remains unclean. He must live alone; he
must live outside the camp.
47"If any clothing is contaminated with
mildew-any woolen or linen clothing,
48any woven or knitted material of linen
or wool, any leather or anything made of
leather-
49and if the contamination in the clothing,
or leather, or woven or knitted material,
or any leather article, is greenish or
reddish, it is a spreading mildew and
must be shown to the priest.
50The priest is to examine the mildew
and isolate the affected article for seven
days.
51On the seventh day he is to examine it,
and if the mildew has spread in the
clothing, or the woven or knitted material,
or the leather, whatever its use, it is a
destructive mildew; the article is unclean.
52He must burn up the clothing, or the
woven or knitted material of wool or
linen, or any leather article that has the
contamination in it, because the mildew
is destructive; the article must be burned
up.
53"But if, when the priest examines it, the
mildew has not spread in the clothing, or
the woven or knitted material, or the
leather article,
54he shall order that the contaminated
article be washed. Then he is to isolate
it for another seven days.
55After the affected article has been
washed, the priest is to examine it, and
if the mildew has not changed its
appearance, even though it has not
spread, it is unclean. Burn it with fire,
whether the mildew has affected one
side or the other.
56If, when the priest examines it, the
mildew has faded after the article has
been washed, he is to tear the
contaminated part out of the clothing, or
the leather, or the woven or knitted
material.
57But if it reappears in the clothing, or in
the woven or knitted material, or in the
leather article, it is spreading, and
whatever has the mildew must be
burned with fire.
58The clothing, or the woven or knitted
material, or any leather article that has
been washed and is rid of the mildew,
must be washed again, and it will be
clean."
59These are the regulations concerning
contamination by mildew in woolen or
linen clothing, woven or knitted material,
or any leather article, for pronouncing
them clean or unclean.
14The Lord said to Moses,
2"These are the regulations for the
diseased person at the time of his
ceremonial cleansing, when he is
brought to the priest:
3The priest is to go outside the camp
and examine him. If the person has
been healed of his infectious skin
disease,
4the priest shall order that two live clean
birds and some cedar wood, scarlet
yarn and hyssop be brought for the one
to be cleansed.
5Then the priest shall order that one of
the birds be killed over fresh water in a
clay pot.
6He is then to take the live bird and dip it,
together with the cedar wood, the
scarlet yarn and the hyssop, into the
blood of the bird that was killed over the
fresh water.
7Seven times he shall sprinkle the one
to be cleansed of the infectious disease
and pronounce him clean. Then he is to
release the live bird in the open fields.
8"The person to be cleansed must wash
his clothes, shave off all his hair and
bathe with water; then he will be
ceremonially clean. After this he may
come into the camp, but he must stay
outside his tent for seven days.
9On the seventh day he must shave off
all his hair; he must shave his head, his
beard, his eyebrows and the rest of his
hair. He must wash his clothes and
bathe himself with water, and he will be
clean.
10"On the eighth day he must bring two
male lambs and one ewe lamb a year
old, each without defect, along with
three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour
mixed with oil for a grain offering, and
one log of oil.
11The priest who pronounces him clean
shall present both the one to be
cleansed and his offerings before the
Lord at the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting.
12"Then the priest is to take one of the
male lambs and offer it as a guilt
offering, along with the log of oil; he
shall wave them before the Lord as a
wave offering.
13He is to slaughter the lamb in the holy
place where the sin offering and the
burnt offering are slaughtered. Like the
sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to
the priest; it is most holy.
14The priest is to take some of the blood
of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe
of the right ear of the one to be cleansed,
on the thumb of his right hand and on
the big toe of his right foot.
15The priest shall then take some of the
log of oil, pour it in the palm of his own
left hand,
16dip his right forefinger into the oil in his
palm, and with his finger sprinkle some
of it before the Lord seven times.
17The priest is to put some of the oil
remaining in his palm on the lobe of the
right ear of the one to be cleansed, on
the thumb of his right hand and on the
big toe of his right foot, on top of the
blood of the guilt offering.
18The rest of the oil in his palm the priest
shall put on the head of the one to be
cleansed and make atonement for him
before the Lord .
19"Then the priest is to sacrifice the sin
offering and make atonement for the
one to be cleansed from his
uncleanness. After that, the priest shall
slaughter the burnt offering
20and offer it on the altar, together with
the grain offering, and make atonement
for him, and he will be clean.
21"If, however, he is poor and cannot
afford these, he must take one male
lamb as a guilt offering to be waved to
make atonement for him, together with a
tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed
with oil for a grain offering, a log of oil,
22and two doves or two young pigeons,
which he can afford, one for a sin
offering and the other for a burnt offering.
23"On the eighth day he must bring them
for his cleansing to the priest at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting, before
the Lord .
24The priest is to take the lamb for the
guilt offering, together with the log of oil,
and wave them before the Lord as a
wave offering.
25He shall slaughter the lamb for the
guilt offering and take some of its blood
and put it on the lobe of the right ear of
the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of
his right hand and on the big toe of his
right foot.
26The priest is to pour some of the oil
into the palm of his own left hand,
27and with his right forefinger sprinkle
some of the oil from his palm seven
times before the Lord .
28Some of the oil in his palm he is to put
on the same places he put the blood of
the guilt offering-on the lobe of the right
ear of the one to be cleansed, on the
thumb of his right hand and on the big
toe of his right foot.
29The rest of the oil in his palm the priest
shall put on the head of the one to be
cleansed, to make atonement for him
before the Lord .
30Then he shall sacrifice the doves or
the young pigeons, which the person
can afford,
31one as a sin offering and the other as
a burnt offering, together with the grain
offering. In this way the priest will make
atonement before the Lord on behalf of
the one to be cleansed."
32These are the regulations for anyone
who has an infectious skin disease and
who cannot afford the regular offerings
for his cleansing.
33The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
34"When you enter the land of Canaan,
which I am giving you as your
possession, and I put a spreading
mildew in a house in that land,
35the owner of the house must go and
tell the priest, 'I have seen something
that looks like mildew in my house.'
36The priest is to order the house to be
emptied before he goes in to examine
the mildew, so that nothing in the house
will be pronounced unclean. After this
the priest is to go in and inspect the
house.
37He is to examine the mildew on the
walls, and if it has greenish or reddish
depressions that appear to be deeper
than the surface of the wall,
38the priest shall go out the doorway of
the house and close it up for seven days.
39On the seventh day the priest shall
return to inspect the house. If the
mildew has spread on the walls,
40he is to order that the contaminated
stones be torn out and thrown into an
unclean place outside the town.
41He must have all the inside walls of
the house scraped and the material that
is scraped off dumped into an unclean
place outside the town.
42Then they are to take other stones to
replace these and take new clay and
plaster the house.
43"If the mildew reappears in the house
after the stones have been torn out and
the house scraped and plastered,
44the priest is to go and examine it and,
if the mildew has spread in the house, it
is a destructive mildew; the house is
unclean.
45It must be torn down-its stones,
timbers and all the plaster-and taken out
of the town to an unclean place.
46"Anyone who goes into the house
while it is closed up will be unclean till
evening.
47Anyone who sleeps or eats in the
house must wash his clothes.
48"But if the priest comes to examine it
and the mildew has not spread after the
house has been plastered, he shall
pronounce the house clean, because
the mildew is gone.
49To purify the house he is to take two
birds and some cedar wood, scarlet
yarn and hyssop.
50He shall kill one of the birds over fresh
water in a clay pot.
51Then he is to take the cedar wood, the
hyssop, the scarlet yarn and the live bird,
dip them into the blood of the dead bird
and the fresh water, and sprinkle the
house seven times.
52He shall purify the house with the
bird's blood, the fresh water, the live bird,
the cedar wood, the hyssop and the
scarlet yarn.
53Then he is to release the live bird in
the open fields outside the town. In this
way he will make atonement for the
house, and it will be clean."
54These are the regulations for any
infectious skin disease, for an itch,
55for mildew in clothing or in a house,
56and for a swelling, a rash or a bright
spot,
57to determine when something is clean
or unclean. These are the regulations
for infectious skin diseases and mildew.
15The Lord said to Moses and
Aaron,
2"Speak to the Israelites and say to
them: 'When any man has a bodily
discharge, the discharge is unclean.
3Whether it continues flowing from his
body or is blocked, it will make him
unclean. This is how his discharge will
bring about uncleanness:
4" 'Any bed the man with a discharge
lies on will be unclean, and anything he
sits on will be unclean.
5Anyone who touches his bed must
wash his clothes and bathe with water,
and he will be unclean till evening.
6Whoever sits on anything that the man
with a discharge sat on must wash his
clothes and bathe with water, and he will
be unclean till evening.
7" 'Whoever touches the man who has a
discharge must wash his clothes and
bathe with water, and he will be unclean
till evening.
8" 'If the man with the discharge spits on
someone who is clean, that person must
wash his clothes and bathe with water,
and he will be unclean till evening.
9" 'Everything the man sits on when
riding will be unclean,
10and whoever touches any of the things
that were under him will be unclean till
evening; whoever picks up those things
must wash his clothes and bathe with
water, and he will be unclean till evening.
11" 'Anyone the man with a discharge
touches without rinsing his hands with
water must wash his clothes and bathe
with water, and he will be unclean till
evening.
12" 'A clay pot that the man touches must
be broken, and any wooden article is to
be rinsed with water.
13" 'When a man is cleansed from his
discharge, he is to count off seven days
for his ceremonial cleansing; he must
wash his clothes and bathe himself with
fresh water, and he will be clean.
14On the eighth day he must take two
doves or two young pigeons and come
before the Lord to the entrance to the
Tent of Meeting and give them to the
priest.
15The priest is to sacrifice them, the one
for a sin offering and the other for a
burnt offering. In this way he will make
atonement before the Lord for the man
because of his discharge.
16" 'When a man has an emission of
semen, he must bathe his whole body
with water, and he will be unclean till
evening.
17Any clothing or leather that has semen
on it must be washed with water, and it
will be unclean till evening.
18When a man lies with a woman and
there is an emission of semen, both
must bathe with water, and they will be
unclean till evening.
19" 'When a woman has her regular flow
of blood, the impurity of her monthly
period will last seven days, and anyone
who touches her will be unclean till
evening.
20" 'Anything she lies on during her
period will be unclean, and anything she
sits on will be unclean.
21Whoever touches her bed must wash
his clothes and bathe with water, and he
will be unclean till evening.
22Whoever touches anything she sits on
must wash his clothes and bathe with
water, and he will be unclean till evening.
23Whether it is the bed or anything she
was sitting on, when anyone touches it,
he will be unclean till evening.
24" 'If a man lies with her and her
monthly flow touches him, he will be
unclean for seven days; any bed he lies
on will be unclean.
25" 'When a woman has a discharge of
blood for many days at a time other than
her monthly period or has a discharge
that continues beyond her period, she
will be unclean as long as she has the
discharge, just as in the days of her
period.
26Any bed she lies on while her
discharge continues will be unclean, as
is her bed during her monthly period,
and anything she sits on will be unclean,
as during her period.
27Whoever touches them will be
unclean; he must wash his clothes and
bathe with water, and he will be unclean
till evening.
28" 'When she is cleansed from her
discharge, she must count off seven
days, and after that she will be
ceremonially clean.
29On the eighth day she must take two
doves or two young pigeons and bring
them to the priest at the entrance to the
Tent of Meeting.
30The priest is to sacrifice one for a sin
offering and the other for a burnt offering.
In this way he will make atonement for
her before the Lord for the uncleanness
of her discharge.
31" 'You must keep the Israelites
separate from things that make them
unclean, so they will not die in their
uncleanness for defiling my dwelling
place, which is among them.' "
32These are the regulations for a man
with a discharge, for anyone made
unclean by an emission of semen,
33for a woman in her monthly period, for
a man or a woman with a discharge,
and for a man who lies with a woman
who is ceremonially unclean.
16The Lord spoke to Moses after the
death of the two sons of Aaron who died
when they approached the Lord .
2The Lord said to Moses: "Tell your
brother Aaron not to come whenever he
chooses into the Most Holy Place
behind the curtain in front of the
atonement cover on the ark, or else he
will die, because I appear in the cloud
over the atonement cover.
3"This is how Aaron is to enter the
sanctuary area: with a young bull for a
sin offering and a ram for a burnt
offering.
4He is to put on the sacred linen tunic,
with linen undergarments next to his
body; he is to tie the linen sash around
him and put on the linen turban. These
are sacred garments; so he must bathe
himself with water before he puts them
on.
5From the Israelite community he is to
take two male goats for a sin offering
and a ram for a burnt offering.
6"Aaron is to offer the bull for his own sin
offering to make atonement for himself
and his household.
7Then he is to take the two goats and
present them before the Lord at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
8He is to cast lots for the two goats-one
lot for the Lord and the other for the
scapegoat.
9Aaron shall bring the goat whose lot
falls to the Lord and sacrifice it for a sin
offering.
10But the goat chosen by lot as the
scapegoat shall be presented alive
before the Lord to be used for making
atonement by sending it into the desert
as a scapegoat.
11"Aaron shall bring the bull for his own
sin offering to make atonement for
himself and his household, and he is to
slaughter the bull for his own sin offering.
12He is to take a censer full of burning
coals from the altar before the Lord and
two handfuls of finely ground fragrant
incense and take them behind the
curtain.
13He is to put the incense on the fire
before the Lord , and the smoke of the
incense will conceal the atonement
cover above the Testimony, so that he
will not die.
14He is to take some of the bull's blood
and with his finger sprinkle it on the front
of the atonement cover; then he shall
sprinkle some of it with his finger seven
times before the atonement cover.
15"He shall then slaughter the goat for
the sin offering for the people and take
its blood behind the curtain and do with
it as he did with the bull's blood: He shall
sprinkle it on the atonement cover and
in front of it.
16In this way he will make atonement for
the Most Holy Place because of the
uncleanness and rebellion of the
Israelites, whatever their sins have been.
He is to do the same for the Tent of
Meeting, which is among them in the
midst of their uncleanness.
17No one is to be in the Tent of Meeting
from the time Aaron goes in to make
atonement in the Most Holy Place until
he comes out, having made atonement
for himself, his household and the whole
community of Israel.
18"Then he shall come out to the altar
that is before the Lord and make
atonement for it. He shall take some of
the bull's blood and some of the goat's
blood and put it on all the horns of the
altar.
19He shall sprinkle some of the blood on
it with his finger seven times to cleanse
it and to consecrate it from the
uncleanness of the Israelites.
20"When Aaron has finished making
atonement for the Most Holy Place, the
Tent of Meeting and the altar, he shall
bring forward the live goat.
21He is to lay both hands on the head of
the live goat and confess over it all the
wickedness and rebellion of the
Israelites-all their sins-and put them on
the goat's head. He shall send the goat
away into the desert in the care of a
man appointed for the task.
22The goat will carry on itself all their
sins to a solitary place; and the man
shall release it in the desert.
23"Then Aaron is to go into the Tent of
Meeting and take off the linen garments
he put on before he entered the Most
Holy Place, and he is to leave them
there.
24He shall bathe himself with water in a
holy place and put on his regular
garments. Then he shall come out and
sacrifice the burnt offering for himself
and the burnt offering for the people, to
make atonement for himself and for the
people.
25He shall also burn the fat of the sin
offering on the altar.
26"The man who releases the goat as a
scapegoat must wash his clothes and
bathe himself with water; afterward he
may come into the camp.
27The bull and the goat for the sin
offerings, whose blood was brought into
the Most Holy Place to make atonement,
must be taken outside the camp; their
hides, flesh and offal are to be burned
up.
28The man who burns them must wash
his clothes and bathe himself with water;
afterward he may come into the camp.
29"This is to be a lasting ordinance for
you: On the tenth day of the seventh
month you must deny yourselves and
not do any work-whether native-born or
an alien living among you-
30because on this day atonement will be
made for you, to cleanse you. Then,
before the Lord , you will be clean from
all your sins.
31It is a sabbath of rest, and you must
deny yourselves; it is a lasting ordinance.
32The priest who is anointed and
ordained to succeed his father as high
priest is to make atonement. He is to put
on the sacred linen garments
33and make atonement for the Most Holy
Place, for the Tent of Meeting and the
altar, and for the priests and all the
people of the community.
34"This is to be a lasting ordinance for
you: Atonement is to be made once a
year for all the sins of the Israelites."
And it was done, as the Lord
commanded Moses.
17The Lord said to Moses,
2"Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all
the Israelites and say to them: 'This is
what the Lord has commanded:
3Any Israelite who sacrifices an ox, a
lamb or a goat in the camp or outside of
it
4instead of bringing it to the entrance to
the Tent of Meeting to present it as an
offering to the Lord in front of the
tabernacle of the Lord -that man shall be
considered guilty of bloodshed; he has
shed blood and must be cut off from his
people.
5This is so the Israelites will bring to the
Lord the sacrifices they are now making
in the open fields. They must bring them
to the priest, that is, to the Lord , at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting and
sacrifice them as fellowship offerings.
6The priest is to sprinkle the blood
against the altar of the Lord at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting and
burn the fat as an aroma pleasing to the
Lord .
7They must no longer offer any of their
sacrifices to the goat idols to whom they
prostitute themselves. This is to be a
lasting ordinance for them and for the
generations to come.'
8"Say to them: 'Any Israelite or any alien
living among them who offers a burnt
offering or sacrifice
9and does not bring it to the entrance to
the Tent of Meeting to sacrifice it to the
Lord -that man must be cut off from his
people.
10" 'Any Israelite or any alien living
among them who eats any blood-I will
set my face against that person who
eats blood and will cut him off from his
people.
11For the life of a creature is in the blood,
and I have given it to you to make
atonement for yourselves on the altar; it
is the blood that makes atonement for
one's life.
12Therefore I say to the Israelites, "None
of you may eat blood, nor may an alien
living among you eat blood."
13" 'Any Israelite or any alien living
among you who hunts any animal or
bird that may be eaten must drain out
the blood and cover it with earth,
14because the life of every creature is its
blood. That is why I have said to the
Israelites, "You must not eat the blood of
any creature, because the life of every
creature is its blood; anyone who eats it
must be cut off."
15" 'Anyone, whether native-born or alien,
who eats anything found dead or torn by
wild animals must wash his clothes and
bathe with water, and he will be
ceremonially unclean till evening; then
he will be clean.
16But if he does not wash his clothes
and bathe himself, he will be held
responsible.' "
18The Lord said to Moses,
2"Speak to the Israelites and say to
them: 'I am the Lord your God.
3You must not do as they do in Egypt,
where you used to live, and you must
not do as they do in the land of Canaan,
where I am bringing you. Do not follow
their practices.
4You must obey my laws and be careful
to follow my decrees. I am the Lord your
God.
5Keep my decrees and laws, for the man
who obeys them will live by them. I am
the Lord .
6" 'No one is to approach any close
relative to have sexual relations. I am
the Lord .
7" 'Do not dishonor your father by having
sexual relations with your mother. She is
your mother; do not have relations with
her.
8" 'Do not have sexual relations with
your father's wife; that would dishonor
your father.
9" 'Do not have sexual relations with
your sister, either your father's daughter
or your mother's daughter, whether she
was born in the same home or
elsewhere.
10" 'Do not have sexual relations with
your son's daughter or your daughter's
daughter; that would dishonor you.
11" 'Do not have sexual relations with the
daughter of your father's wife, born to
your father; she is your sister.
12" 'Do not have sexual relations with
your father's sister; she is your father's
close relative.
13" 'Do not have sexual relations with
your mother's sister, because she is
your mother's close relative.
14" 'Do not dishonor your father's brother
by approaching his wife to have sexual
relations; she is your aunt.
15" 'Do not have sexual relations with
your daughter-in-law. She is your son's
wife; do not have relations with her.
16" 'Do not have sexual relations with
your brother's wife; that would dishonor
your brother.
17" 'Do not have sexual relations with
both a woman and her daughter. Do not
have sexual relations with either her
son's daughter or her daughter's
daughter; they are her close relatives.
That is wickedness.
18" 'Do not take your wife's sister as a
rival wife and have sexual relations with
her while your wife is living.
19" 'Do not approach a woman to have
sexual relations during the uncleanness
of her monthly period.
20" 'Do not have sexual relations with
your neighbor's wife and defile yourself
with her.
21" 'Do not give any of your children to
be sacrificed to Molech, for you must not
profane the name of your God. I am the
Lord .
22" 'Do not lie with a man as one lies with
a woman; that is detestable.
23" 'Do not have sexual relations with an
animal and defile yourself with it. A
woman must not present herself to an
animal to have sexual relations with it;
that is a perversion.
24" 'Do not defile yourselves in any of
these ways, because this is how the
nations that I am going to drive out
before you became defiled.
25Even the land was defiled; so I
punished it for its sin, and the land
vomited out its inhabitants.
26But you must keep my decrees and
my laws. The native-born and the aliens
living among you must not do any of
these detestable things,
27for all these things were done by the
people who lived in the land before you,
and the land became defiled.
28And if you defile the land, it will vomit
you out as it vomited out the nations that
were before you.
29" 'Everyone who does any of these
detestable things-such persons must be
cut off from their people.
30Keep my requirements and do not
follow any of the detestable customs
that were practiced before you came
and do not defile yourselves with them. I
am the Lord your God.' "
19The Lord said to Moses,
2"Speak to the entire assembly of Israel
and say to them: 'Be holy because I, the
Lord your God, am holy.
3" 'Each of you must respect his mother
and father, and you must observe my
Sabbaths. I am the Lord your God.
4" 'Do not turn to idols or make gods of
cast metal for yourselves. I am the Lord
your God.
5" 'When you sacrifice a fellowship
offering to the Lord , sacrifice it in such a
way that it will be accepted on your
behalf.
6It shall be eaten on the day you
sacrifice it or on the next day; anything
left over until the third day must be
burned up.
7If any of it is eaten on the third day, it is
impure and will not be accepted.
8Whoever eats it will be held responsible
because he has desecrated what is holy
to the Lord ; that person must be cut off
from his people.
9" 'When you reap the harvest of your
land, do not reap to the very edges of
your field or gather the gleanings of your
harvest.
10Do not go over your vineyard a second
time or pick up the grapes that have
fallen. Leave them for the poor and the
alien. I am the Lord your God.
11" 'Do not steal. " 'Do not lie. " 'Do not
deceive one another.
12" 'Do not swear falsely by my name
and so profane the name of your God. I
am the Lord .
13" 'Do not defraud your neighbor or rob
him. " 'Do not hold back the wages of a
hired man overnight.
14" 'Do not curse the deaf or put a
stumbling block in front of the blind, but
fear your God. I am the Lord .
15" 'Do not pervert justice; do not show
partiality to the poor or favoritism to the
great, but judge your neighbor fairly.
16" 'Do not go about spreading slander
among your people. " 'Do not do
anything that endangers your neighbor's
life. I am the Lord .
17" 'Do not hate your brother in your
heart. Rebuke your neighbor frankly so
you will not share in his guilt.
18" 'Do not seek revenge or bear a
grudge against one of your people, but
love your neighbor as yourself. I am the
Lord .
19" 'Keep my decrees. " 'Do not mate
different kinds of animals. " 'Do not plant
your field with two kinds of seed. " 'Do
not wear clothing woven of two kinds of
material.
20" 'If a man sleeps with a woman who is
a slave girl promised to another man but
who has not been ransomed or given
her freedom, there must be due
punishment. Yet they are not to be put
to death, because she had not been
freed.
21The man, however, must bring a ram
to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting
for a guilt offering to the Lord .
22With the ram of the guilt offering the
priest is to make atonement for him
before the Lord for the sin he has
committed, and his sin will be forgiven.
23" 'When you enter the land and plant
any kind of fruit tree, regard its fruit as
forbidden. For three years you are to
consider it forbidden ; it must not be
eaten.
24In the fourth year all its fruit will be holy,
an offering of praise to the Lord .
25But in the fifth year you may eat its
fruit. In this way your harvest will be
increased. I am the Lord your God.
26" 'Do not eat any meat with the blood
still in it. " 'Do not practice divination or
sorcery.
27" 'Do not cut the hair at the sides of
your head or clip off the edges of your
beard.
28" 'Do not cut your bodies for the dead
or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am
the Lord .
29" 'Do not degrade your daughter by
making her a prostitute, or the land will
turn to prostitution and be filled with
wickedness.
30" 'Observe my Sabbaths and have
reverence for my sanctuary. I am the
Lord .
31" 'Do not turn to mediums or seek out
spiritists, for you will be defiled by them.
I am the Lord your God.
32" 'Rise in the presence of the aged,
show respect for the elderly and revere
your God. I am the Lord .
33" 'When an alien lives with you in your
land, do not mistreat him.
34The alien living with you must be
treated as one of your native-born. Love
him as yourself, for you were aliens in
Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
35" 'Do not use dishonest standards
when measuring length, weight or
quantity.
36Use honest scales and honest weights,
an honest ephah and an honest hin. I
am the Lord your God, who brought you
out of Egypt.
37" 'Keep all my decrees and all my laws
and follow them. I am the Lord .' "
20The Lord said to Moses,
2"Say to the Israelites: 'Any Israelite or
any alien living in Israel who gives any
of his children to Molech must be put to
death. The people of the community are
to stone him.
3I will set my face against that man and I
will cut him off from his people; for by
giving his children to Molech, he has
defiled my sanctuary and profaned my
holy name.
4If the people of the community close
their eyes when that man gives one of
his children to Molech and they fail to
put him to death,
5I will set my face against that man and
his family and will cut off from their
people both him and all who follow him
in prostituting themselves to Molech.
6" 'I will set my face against the person
who turns to mediums and spiritists to
prostitute himself by following them, and
I will cut him off from his people.
7" 'Consecrate yourselves and be holy,
because I am the Lord your God.
8Keep my decrees and follow them. I am
the Lord , who makes you holy.
9" 'If anyone curses his father or mother,
he must be put to death. He has cursed
his father or his mother, and his blood
will be on his own head.
10" 'If a man commits adultery with
another man's wife-with the wife of his
neighbor-both the adulterer and the
adulteress must be put to death.
11" 'If a man sleeps with his father's wife,
he has dishonored his father. Both the
man and the woman must be put to
death; their blood will be on their own
heads.
12" 'If a man sleeps with his daughter-inlaw,
both of them must be put to death.
What they have done is a perversion;
their blood will be on their own heads.
13" 'If a man lies with a man as one lies
with a woman, both of them have done
what is detestable. They must be put to
death; their blood will be on their own
heads.
14" 'If a man marries both a woman and
her mother, it is wicked. Both he and
they must be burned in the fire, so that
no wickedness will be among you.
15" 'If a man has sexual relations with an
animal, he must be put to death, and
you must kill the animal.
16" 'If a woman approaches an animal to
have sexual relations with it, kill both the
woman and the animal. They must be
put to death; their blood will be on their
own heads.
17" 'If a man marries his sister, the
daughter of either his father or his
mother, and they have sexual relations,
it is a disgrace. They must be cut off
before the eyes of their people. He has
dishonored his sister and will be held
responsible.
18" 'If a man lies with a woman during
her monthly period and has sexual
relations with her, he has exposed the
source of her flow, and she has also
uncovered it. Both of them must be cut
off from their people.
19" 'Do not have sexual relations with the
sister of either your mother or your
father, for that would dishonor a close
relative; both of you would be held
responsible.
20" 'If a man sleeps with his aunt, he has
dishonored his uncle. They will be held
responsible; they will die childless.
21" 'If a man marries his brother's wife, it
is an act of impurity; he has dishonored
his brother. They will be childless.
22" 'Keep all my decrees and laws and
follow them, so that the land where I am
bringing you to live may not vomit you
out.
23You must not live according to the
customs of the nations I am going to
drive out before you. Because they did
all these things, I abhorred them.
24But I said to you, "You will possess
their land; I will give it to you as an
inheritance, a land flowing with milk and
honey." I am the Lord your God, who
has set you apart from the nations.
25" 'You must therefore make a
distinction between clean and unclean
animals and between unclean and clean
birds. Do not defile yourselves by any
animal or bird or anything that moves
along the ground-those which I have set
apart as unclean for you.
26You are to be holy to me because I,
the Lord , am holy, and I have set you
apart from the nations to be my own.
27" 'A man or woman who is a medium
or spiritist among you must be put to
death. You are to stone them; their
blood will be on their own heads.' "
21The Lord said to Moses, "Speak to
the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say
to them: 'A priest must not make himself
ceremonially unclean for any of his
people who die,
2except for a close relative, such as his
mother or father, his son or daughter,
his brother,
3or an unmarried sister who is
dependent on him since she has no
husband-for her he may make himself
unclean.
4He must not make himself unclean for
people related to him by marriage, and
so defile himself.
5" 'Priests must not shave their heads or
shave off the edges of their beards or
cut their bodies.
6They must be holy to their God and
must not profane the name of their God.
Because they present the offerings
made to the Lord by fire, the food of
their God, they are to be holy.
7" 'They must not marry women defiled
by prostitution or divorced from their
husbands, because priests are holy to
their God.
8Regard them as holy, because they
offer up the food of your God. Consider
them holy, because I the Lord am holy-I
who make you holy.
9" 'If a priest's daughter defiles herself by
becoming a prostitute, she disgraces
her father; she must be burned in the
fire.
10" 'The high priest, the one among his
brothers who has had the anointing oil
poured on his head and who has been
ordained to wear the priestly garments,
must not let his hair become unkempt or
tear his clothes.
11He must not enter a place where there
is a dead body. He must not make
himself unclean, even for his father or
mother,
12nor leave the sanctuary of his God or
desecrate it, because he has been
dedicated by the anointing oil of his God.
I am the Lord .
13" 'The woman he marries must be a
virgin.
14He must not marry a widow, a
divorced woman, or a woman defiled by
prostitution, but only a virgin from his
own people,
15so he will not defile his offspring
among his people. I am the Lord , who
makes him holy. ' "
16The Lord said to Moses,
17"Say to Aaron: 'For the generations to
come none of your descendants who
has a defect may come near to offer the
food of his God.
18No man who has any defect may
come near: no man who is blind or lame,
disfigured or deformed;
19no man with a crippled foot or hand,
20or who is hunchbacked or dwarfed, or
who has any eye defect, or who has
festering or running sores or damaged
testicles.
21No descendant of Aaron the priest
who has any defect is to come near to
present the offerings made to the Lord
by fire. He has a defect; he must not
come near to offer the food of his God.
22He may eat the most holy food of his
God, as well as the holy food;
23yet because of his defect, he must not
go near the curtain or approach the altar,
and so desecrate my sanctuary. I am
the Lord , who makes them holy. ' "
24So Moses told this to Aaron and his
sons and to all the Israelites.
22The Lord said to Moses,
2"Tell Aaron and his sons to treat with
respect the sacred offerings the
Israelites consecrate to me, so they will
not profane my holy name. I am the
Lord .
3"Say to them: 'For the generations to
come, if any of your descendants is
ceremonially unclean and yet comes
near the sacred offerings that the
Israelites consecrate to the Lord , that
person must be cut off from my
presence. I am the Lord .
4" 'If a descendant of Aaron has an
infectious skin disease or a bodily
discharge, he may not eat the sacred
offerings until he is cleansed. He will
also be unclean if he touches something
defiled by a corpse or by anyone who
has an emission of semen,
5or if he touches any crawling thing that
makes him unclean, or any person who
makes him unclean, whatever the
uncleanness may be.
6The one who touches any such thing
will be unclean till evening. He must not
eat any of the sacred offerings unless
he has bathed himself with water.
7When the sun goes down, he will be
clean, and after that he may eat the
sacred offerings, for they are his food.
8He must not eat anything found dead or
torn by wild animals, and so become
unclean through it. I am the Lord .
9" 'The priests are to keep my
requirements so that they do not
become guilty and die for treating them
with contempt. I am the Lord , who
makes them holy.
10" 'No one outside a priest's family may
eat the sacred offering, nor may the
guest of a priest or his hired worker eat
it.
11But if a priest buys a slave with money,
or if a slave is born in his household,
that slave may eat his food.
12If a priest's daughter marries anyone
other than a priest, she may not eat any
of the sacred contributions.
13But if a priest's daughter becomes a
widow or is divorced, yet has no children,
and she returns to live in her father's
house as in her youth, she may eat of
her father's food. No unauthorized
person, however, may eat any of it.
14" 'If anyone eats a sacred offering by
mistake, he must make restitution to the
priest for the offering and add a fifth of
the value to it.
15The priests must not desecrate the
sacred offerings the Israelites present to
the Lord
16by allowing them to eat the sacred
offerings and so bring upon them guilt
requiring payment. I am the Lord , who
makes them holy.' "
17The Lord said to Moses,
18"Speak to Aaron and his sons and to
all the Israelites and say to them: 'If any
of you-either an Israelite or an alien
living in Israel-presents a gift for a burnt
offering to the Lord , either to fulfill a
vow or as a freewill offering,
19you must present a male without
defect from the cattle, sheep or goats in
order that it may be accepted on your
behalf.
20Do not bring anything with a defect,
because it will not be accepted on your
behalf.
21When anyone brings from the herd or
flock a fellowship offering to the Lord to
fulfill a special vow or as a freewill
offering, it must be without defect or
blemish to be acceptable.
22Do not offer to the Lord the blind, the
injured or the maimed, or anything with
warts or festering or running sores. Do
not place any of these on the altar as an
offering made to the Lord by fire.
23You may, however, present as a
freewill offering an ox or a sheep that is
deformed or stunted, but it will not be
accepted in fulfillment of a vow.
24You must not offer to the Lord an
animal whose testicles are bruised,
crushed, torn or cut. You must not do
this in your own land,
25and you must not accept such animals
from the hand of a foreigner and offer
them as the food of your God. They will
not be accepted on your behalf,
because they are deformed and have
defects.' "
26The Lord said to Moses,
27"When a calf, a lamb or a goat is born,
it is to remain with its mother for seven
days. From the eighth day on, it will be
acceptable as an offering made to the
Lord by fire.
28Do not slaughter a cow or a sheep and
its young on the same day.
29"When you sacrifice a thank offering to
the Lord , sacrifice it in such a way that
it will be accepted on your behalf.
30It must be eaten that same day; leave
none of it till morning. I am the Lord .
31"Keep my commands and follow them.
I am the Lord .
32Do not profane my holy name. I must
be acknowledged as holy by the
Israelites. I am the Lord , who makes
you holy
33and who brought you out of Egypt to
be your God. I am the Lord ."
23The Lord said to Moses,
2"Speak to the Israelites and say to
them: 'These are my appointed feasts,
the appointed feasts of the Lord , which
you are to proclaim as sacred
assemblies.
3" 'There are six days when you may
work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath
of rest, a day of sacred assembly. You
are not to do any work; wherever you
live, it is a Sabbath to the Lord .
4" 'These are the Lord 's appointed
feasts, the sacred assemblies you are to
proclaim at their appointed times:
5The Lord 's Passover begins at twilight
on the fourteenth day of the first month.
6On the fifteenth day of that month the
Lord 's Feast of Unleavened Bread
begins; for seven days you must eat
bread made without yeast.
7On the first day hold a sacred assembly
and do no regular work.
8For seven days present an offering
made to the Lord by fire. And on the
seventh day hold a sacred assembly
and do no regular work.' "
9The Lord said to Moses,
10"Speak to the Israelites and say to
them: 'When you enter the land I am
going to give you and you reap its
harvest, bring to the priest a sheaf of the
first grain you harvest.
11He is to wave the sheaf before the
Lord so it will be accepted on your
behalf; the priest is to wave it on the day
after the Sabbath.
12On the day you wave the sheaf, you
must sacrifice as a burnt offering to the
Lord a lamb a year old without defect,
13together with its grain offering of twotenths
of an ephah of fine flour mixed
with oil-an offering made to the Lord by
fire, a pleasing aroma-and its drink
offering of a quarter of a hin of wine.
14You must not eat any bread, or
roasted or new grain, until the very day
you bring this offering to your God. This
is to be a lasting ordinance for the
generations to come, wherever you live.
15" 'From the day after the Sabbath, the
day you brought the sheaf of the wave
offering, count off seven full weeks.
16Count off fifty days up to the day after
the seventh Sabbath, and then present
an offering of new grain to the Lord .
17From wherever you live, bring two
loaves made of two-tenths of an ephah
of fine flour, baked with yeast, as a
wave offering of firstfruits to the Lord .
18Present with this bread seven male
lambs, each a year old and without
defect, one young bull and two rams.
They will be a burnt offering to the Lord ,
together with their grain offerings and
drink offerings-an offering made by fire,
an aroma pleasing to the Lord .
19Then sacrifice one male goat for a sin
offering and two lambs, each a year old,
for a fellowship offering.
20The priest is to wave the two lambs
before the Lord as a wave offering,
together with the bread of the firstfruits.
They are a sacred offering to the Lord
for the priest.
21On that same day you are to proclaim
a sacred assembly and do no regular
work. This is to be a lasting ordinance
for the generations to come, wherever
you live.
22" 'When you reap the harvest of your
land, do not reap to the very edges of
your field or gather the gleanings of your
harvest. Leave them for the poor and
the alien. I am the Lord your God.' "
23The Lord said to Moses,
24"Say to the Israelites: 'On the first day
of the seventh month you are to have a
day of rest, a sacred assembly
commemorated with trumpet blasts.
25Do no regular work, but present an
offering made to the Lord by fire.' "
26The Lord said to Moses,
27"The tenth day of this seventh month is
the Day of Atonement. Hold a sacred
assembly and deny yourselves, and
present an offering made to the Lord by
fire.
28Do no work on that day, because it is
the Day of Atonement, when atonement
is made for you before the Lord your
God.
29Anyone who does not deny himself on
that day must be cut off from his people.
30I will destroy from among his people
anyone who does any work on that day.
31You shall do no work at all. This is to
be a lasting ordinance for the
generations to come, wherever you live.
32It is a sabbath of rest for you, and you
must deny yourselves. From the
evening of the ninth day of the month
until the following evening you are to
observe your sabbath."
33The Lord said to Moses,
34"Say to the Israelites: 'On the fifteenth
day of the seventh month the Lord 's
Feast of Tabernacles begins, and it lasts
for seven days.
35The first day is a sacred assembly; do
no regular work.
36For seven days present offerings
made to the Lord by fire, and on the
eighth day hold a sacred assembly and
present an offering made to the Lord by
fire. It is the closing assembly; do no
regular work.
37(" 'These are the Lord 's appointed
feasts, which you are to proclaim as
sacred assemblies for bringing offerings
made to the Lord by fire-the burnt
offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices
and drink offerings required for each day.
38These offerings are in addition to
those for the Lord 's Sabbaths and in
addition to your gifts and whatever you
have vowed and all the freewill offerings
you give to the Lord .)
39" 'So beginning with the fifteenth day of
the seventh month, after you have
gathered the crops of the land, celebrate
the festival to the Lord for seven days;
the first day is a day of rest, and the
eighth day also is a day of rest.
40On the first day you are to take choice
fruit from the trees, and palm fronds,
leafy branches and poplars, and rejoice
before the Lord your God for seven days.
41Celebrate this as a festival to the Lord
for seven days each year. This is to be a
lasting ordinance for the generations to
come; celebrate it in the seventh month.
42Live in booths for seven days: All
native-born Israelites are to live in
booths
43so your descendants will know that I
had the Israelites live in booths when I
brought them out of Egypt. I am the Lord
your God.' "
44So Moses announced to the Israelites
the appointed feasts of the Lord .
24The Lord said to Moses,
2"Command the Israelites to bring you
clear oil of pressed olives for the light so
that the lamps may be kept burning
continually.
3Outside the curtain of the Testimony in
the Tent of Meeting, Aaron is to tend the
lamps before the Lord from evening till
morning, continually. This is to be a
lasting ordinance for the generations to
come.
4The lamps on the pure gold lampstand
before the Lord must be tended
continually.
5"Take fine flour and bake twelve loaves
of bread, using two-tenths of an ephah
for each loaf.
6Set them in two rows, six in each row,
on the table of pure gold before the
Lord .
7Along each row put some pure incense
as a memorial portion to represent the
bread and to be an offering made to the
Lord by fire.
8This bread is to be set out before the
Lord regularly, Sabbath after Sabbath,
on behalf of the Israelites, as a lasting
covenant.
9It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who
are to eat it in a holy place, because it is
a most holy part of their regular share of
the offerings made to the Lord by fire." A
Blasphemer Stoned
10Now the son of an Israelite mother and
an Egyptian father went out among the
Israelites, and a fight broke out in the
camp between him and an Israelite.
11The son of the Israelite woman
blasphemed the Name with a curse; so
they brought him to Moses. (His
mother's name was Shelomith, the
daughter of Dibri the Danite.)
12They put him in custody until the will of
the Lord should be made clear to them.
13Then the Lord said to Moses:
14"Take the blasphemer outside the
camp. All those who heard him are to
lay their hands on his head, and the
entire assembly is to stone him.
15Say to the Israelites: 'If anyone curses
his God, he will be held responsible;
16anyone who blasphemes the name of
the Lord must be put to death. The
entire assembly must stone him.
Whether an alien or native-born, when
he blasphemes the Name, he must be
put to death.
17" 'If anyone takes the life of a human
being, he must be put to death.
18Anyone who takes the life of
someone's animal must make
restitution-life for life.
19If anyone injures his neighbor,
whatever he has done must be done to
him:
20fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth
for tooth. As he has injured the other, so
he is to be injured.
21Whoever kills an animal must make
restitution, but whoever kills a man must
be put to death.
22You are to have the same law for the
alien and the native-born. I am the Lord
your God.' "
23Then Moses spoke to the Israelites,
and they took the blasphemer outside
the camp and stoned him. The Israelites
did as the Lord commanded Moses.
25The Lord said to Moses on Mount
Sinai,
2"Speak to the Israelites and say to
them: 'When you enter the land I am
going to give you, the land itself must
observe a sabbath to the Lord .
3For six years sow your fields, and for
six years prune your vineyards and
gather their crops.
4But in the seventh year the land is to
have a sabbath of rest, a sabbath to the
Lord . Do not sow your fields or prune
your vineyards.
5Do not reap what grows of itself or
harvest the grapes of your untended
vines. The land is to have a year of rest.
6Whatever the land yields during the
sabbath year will be food for you-for
yourself, your manservant and
maidservant, and the hired worker and
temporary resident who live among you,
7as well as for your livestock and the
wild animals in your land. Whatever the
land produces may be eaten.
8" 'Count off seven sabbaths of yearsseven
times seven years-so that the
seven sabbaths of years amount to a
period of forty-nine years.
9Then have the trumpet sounded
everywhere on the tenth day of the
seventh month; on the Day of
Atonement sound the trumpet
throughout your land.
10Consecrate the fiftieth year and
proclaim liberty throughout the land to
all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for
you; each one of you is to return to his
family property and each to his own clan.
11The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for
you; do not sow and do not reap what
grows of itself or harvest the untended
vines.
12For it is a jubilee and is to be holy for
you; eat only what is taken directly from
the fields.
13" 'In this Year of Jubilee everyone is to
return to his own property.
14" 'If you sell land to one of your
countrymen or buy any from him, do not
take advantage of each other.
15You are to buy from your countryman
on the basis of the number of years
since the Jubilee. And he is to sell to
you on the basis of the number of years
left for harvesting crops.
16When the years are many, you are to
increase the price, and when the years
are few, you are to decrease the price,
because what he is really selling you is
the number of crops.
17Do not take advantage of each other,
but fear your God. I am the Lord your
God.
18" 'Follow my decrees and be careful to
obey my laws, and you will live safely in
the land.
19Then the land will yield its fruit, and
you will eat your fill and live there in
safety.
20You may ask, "What will we eat in the
seventh year if we do not plant or
harvest our crops?"
21I will send you such a blessing in the
sixth year that the land will yield enough
for three years.
22While you plant during the eighth year,
you will eat from the old crop and will
continue to eat from it until the harvest
of the ninth year comes in.
23" 'The land must not be sold
permanently, because the land is mine
and you are but aliens and my tenants.
24Throughout the country that you hold
as a possession, you must provide for
the redemption of the land.
25" 'If one of your countrymen becomes
poor and sells some of his property, his
nearest relative is to come and redeem
what his countryman has sold.
26If, however, a man has no one to
redeem it for him but he himself
prospers and acquires sufficient means
to redeem it,
27he is to determine the value for the
years since he sold it and refund the
balance to the man to whom he sold it;
he can then go back to his own property.
28But if he does not acquire the means
to repay him, what he sold will remain in
the possession of the buyer until the
Year of Jubilee. It will be returned in the
Jubilee, and he can then go back to his
property.
29" 'If a man sells a house in a walled
city, he retains the right of redemption a
full year after its sale. During that time
he may redeem it.
30If it is not redeemed before a full year
has passed, the house in the walled city
shall belong permanently to the buyer
and his descendants. It is not to be
returned in the Jubilee.
31But houses in villages without walls
around them are to be considered as
open country. They can be redeemed,
and they are to be returned in the
Jubilee.
32" 'The Levites always have the right to
redeem their houses in the Levitical
towns, which they possess.
33So the property of the Levites is
redeemable-that is, a house sold in any
town they hold-and is to be returned in
the Jubilee, because the houses in the
towns of the Levites are their property
among the Israelites.
34But the pastureland belonging to their
towns must not be sold; it is their
permanent possession.
35" 'If one of your countrymen becomes
poor and is unable to support himself
among you, help him as you would an
alien or a temporary resident, so he can
continue to live among you.
36Do not take interest of any kind from
him, but fear your God, so that your
countryman may continue to live among
you.
37You must not lend him money at
interest or sell him food at a profit.
38I am the Lord your God, who brought
you out of Egypt to give you the land of
Canaan and to be your God.
39" 'If one of your countrymen becomes
poor among you and sells himself to you,
do not make him work as a slave.
40He is to be treated as a hired worker
or a temporary resident among you; he
is to work for you until the Year of
Jubilee.
41Then he and his children are to be
released, and he will go back to his own
clan and to the property of his
forefathers.
42Because the Israelites are my servants,
whom I brought out of Egypt, they must
not be sold as slaves.
43Do not rule over them ruthlessly, but
fear your God.
44" 'Your male and female slaves are to
come from the nations around you; from
them you may buy slaves.
45You may also buy some of the
temporary residents living among you
and members of their clans born in your
country, and they will become your
property.
46You can will them to your children as
inherited property and can make them
slaves for life, but you must not rule over
your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.
47" 'If an alien or a temporary resident
among you becomes rich and one of
your countrymen becomes poor and
sells himself to the alien living among
you or to a member of the alien's clan,
48he retains the right of redemption after
he has sold himself. One of his relatives
may redeem him:
49An uncle or a cousin or any blood
relative in his clan may redeem him. Or
if he prospers, he may redeem himself.
50He and his buyer are to count the time
from the year he sold himself up to the
Year of Jubilee. The price for his release
is to be based on the rate paid to a hired
man for that number of years.
51If many years remain, he must pay for
his redemption a larger share of the
price paid for him.
52If only a few years remain until the
Year of Jubilee, he is to compute that
and pay for his redemption accordingly.
53He is to be treated as a man hired
from year to year; you must see to it that
his owner does not rule over him
ruthlessly.
54" 'Even if he is not redeemed in any of
these ways, he and his children are to
be released in the Year of Jubilee,
55for the Israelites belong to me as
servants. They are my servants, whom I
brought out of Egypt. I am the Lord your
God.
26" 'Do not make idols or set up an
image or a sacred stone for yourselves,
and do not place a carved stone in your
land to bow down before it. I am the
Lord your God.
2" 'Observe my Sabbaths and have
reverence for my sanctuary. I am the
Lord .
3" 'If you follow my decrees and are
careful to obey my commands,
4I will send you rain in its season, and
the ground will yield its crops and the
trees of the field their fruit.
5Your threshing will continue until grape
harvest and the grape harvest will
continue until planting, and you will eat
all the food you want and live in safety in
your land.
6" 'I will grant peace in the land, and you
will lie down and no one will make you
afraid. I will remove savage beasts from
the land, and the sword will not pass
through your country.
7You will pursue your enemies, and they
will fall by the sword before you.
8Five of you will chase a hundred, and a
hundred of you will chase ten thousand,
and your enemies will fall by the sword
before you.
9" 'I will look on you with favor and make
you fruitful and increase your numbers,
and I will keep my covenant with you.
10You will still be eating last year's
harvest when you will have to move it
out to make room for the new.
11I will put my dwelling place among you,
and I will not abhor you.
12I will walk among you and be your God,
and you will be my people.
13I am the Lord your God, who brought
you out of Egypt so that you would no
longer be slaves to the Egyptians; I
broke the bars of your yoke and enabled
you to walk with heads held high.
14" 'But if you will not listen to me and
carry out all these commands,
15and if you reject my decrees and
abhor my laws and fail to carry out all
my commands and so violate my
covenant,
16then I will do this to you: I will bring
upon you sudden terror, wasting
diseases and fever that will destroy your
sight and drain away your life. You will
plant seed in vain, because your
enemies will eat it.
17I will set my face against you so that
you will be defeated by your enemies;
those who hate you will rule over you,
and you will flee even when no one is
pursuing you.
18" 'If after all this you will not listen to
me, I will punish you for your sins seven
times over.
19I will break down your stubborn pride
and make the sky above you like iron
and the ground beneath you like bronze.
20Your strength will be spent in vain,
because your soil will not yield its crops,
nor will the trees of the land yield their
fruit.
21" 'If you remain hostile toward me and
refuse to listen to me, I will multiply your
afflictions seven times over, as your sins
deserve.
22I will send wild animals against you,
and they will rob you of your children,
destroy your cattle and make you so few
in number that your roads will be
deserted.
23" 'If in spite of these things you do not
accept my correction but continue to be
hostile toward me,
24I myself will be hostile toward you and
will afflict you for your sins seven times
over.
25And I will bring the sword upon you to
avenge the breaking of the covenant.
When you withdraw into your cities, I will
send a plague among you, and you will
be given into enemy hands.
26When I cut off your supply of bread,
ten women will be able to bake your
bread in one oven, and they will dole out
the bread by weight. You will eat, but
you will not be satisfied.
27" 'If in spite of this you still do not listen
to me but continue to be hostile toward
me,
28then in my anger I will be hostile
toward you, and I myself will punish you
for your sins seven times over.
29You will eat the flesh of your sons and
the flesh of your daughters.
30I will destroy your high places, cut
down your incense altars and pile your
dead bodies on the lifeless forms of your
idols, and I will abhor you.
31I will turn your cities into ruins and lay
waste your sanctuaries, and I will take
no delight in the pleasing aroma of your
offerings.
32I will lay waste the land, so that your
enemies who live there will be appalled.
33I will scatter you among the nations
and will draw out my sword and pursue
you. Your land will be laid waste, and
your cities will lie in ruins.
34Then the land will enjoy its sabbath
years all the time that it lies desolate
and you are in the country of your
enemies; then the land will rest and
enjoy its sabbaths.
35All the time that it lies desolate, the
land will have the rest it did not have
during the sabbaths you lived in it.
36" 'As for those of you who are left, I will
make their hearts so fearful in the lands
of their enemies that the sound of a
windblown leaf will put them to flight.
They will run as though fleeing from the
sword, and they will fall, even though no
one is pursuing them.
37They will stumble over one another as
though fleeing from the sword, even
though no one is pursuing them. So you
will not be able to stand before your
enemies.
38You will perish among the nations; the
land of your enemies will devour you.
39Those of you who are left will waste
away in the lands of their enemies
because of their sins; also because of
their fathers' sins they will waste away.
40" 'But if they will confess their sins and
the sins of their fathers-their treachery
against me and their hostility toward me,
41which made me hostile toward them
so that I sent them into the land of their
enemies-then when their uncircumcised
hearts are humbled and they pay for
their sin,
42I will remember my covenant with
Jacob and my covenant with Isaac and
my covenant with Abraham, and I will
remember the land.
43For the land will be deserted by them
and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies
desolate without them. They will pay for
their sins because they rejected my laws
and abhorred my decrees.
44Yet in spite of this, when they are in
the land of their enemies, I will not reject
them or abhor them so as to destroy
them completely, breaking my covenant
with them. I am the Lord their God.
45But for their sake I will remember the
covenant with their ancestors whom I
brought out of Egypt in the sight of the
nations to be their God. I am the Lord .' "
46These are the decrees, the laws and
the regulations that the Lord established
on Mount Sinai between himself and the
Israelites through Moses.
27The Lord said to Moses,
2"Speak to the Israelites and say to
them: 'If anyone makes a special vow to
dedicate persons to the Lord by giving
equivalent values,
3set the value of a male between the
ages of twenty and sixty at fifty shekels
of silver, according to the sanctuary
shekel ;
4and if it is a female, set her value at
thirty shekels.
5If it is a person between the ages of five
and twenty, set the value of a male at
twenty shekels and of a female at ten
shekels.
6If it is a person between one month and
five years, set the value of a male at five
shekels of silver and that of a female at
three shekels of silver.
7If it is a person sixty years old or more,
set the value of a male at fifteen shekels
and of a female at ten shekels.
8If anyone making the vow is too poor to
pay the specified amount, he is to
present the person to the priest, who will
set the value for him according to what
the man making the vow can afford.
9" 'If what he vowed is an animal that is
acceptable as an offering to the Lord ,
such an animal given to the Lord
becomes holy.
10He must not exchange it or substitute
a good one for a bad one, or a bad one
for a good one; if he should substitute
one animal for another, both it and the
substitute become holy.
11If what he vowed is a ceremonially
unclean animal-one that is not
acceptable as an offering to the Lord -
the animal must be presented to the
priest,
12who will judge its quality as good or
bad. Whatever value the priest then sets,
that is what it will be.
13If the owner wishes to redeem the
animal, he must add a fifth to its value.
14" 'If a man dedicates his house as
something holy to the Lord , the priest
will judge its quality as good or bad.
Whatever value the priest then sets, so
it will remain.
15If the man who dedicates his house
redeems it, he must add a fifth to its
value, and the house will again become
his.
16" 'If a man dedicates to the Lord part of
his family land, its value is to be set
according to the amount of seed
required for it-fifty shekels of silver to a
homer of barley seed.
17If he dedicates his field during the
Year of Jubilee, the value that has been
set remains.
18But if he dedicates his field after the
Jubilee, the priest will determine the
value according to the number of years
that remain until the next Year of Jubilee,
and its set value will be reduced.
19If the man who dedicates the field
wishes to redeem it, he must add a fifth
to its value, and the field will again
become his.
20If, however, he does not redeem the
field, or if he has sold it to someone else,
it can never be redeemed.
21When the field is released in the
Jubilee, it will become holy, like a field
devoted to the Lord ; it will become the
property of the priests.
22" 'If a man dedicates to the Lord a field
he has bought, which is not part of his
family land,
23the priest will determine its value up to
the Year of Jubilee, and the man must
pay its value on that day as something
holy to the Lord .
24In the Year of Jubilee the field will
revert to the person from whom he
bought it, the one whose land it was.
25Every value is to be set according to
the sanctuary shekel, twenty gerahs to
the shekel.
26" 'No one, however, may dedicate the
firstborn of an animal, since the firstborn
already belongs to the Lord ; whether an
ox or a sheep, it is the Lord 's.
27If it is one of the unclean animals, he
may buy it back at its set value, adding
a fifth of the value to it. If he does not
redeem it, it is to be sold at its set value.
28" 'But nothing that a man owns and
devotes to the Lord -whether man or
animal or family land-may be sold or
redeemed; everything so devoted is
most holy to the Lord .
29" 'No person devoted to destruction
may be ransomed; he must be put to
death.
30" 'A tithe of everything from the land,
whether grain from the soil or fruit from
the trees, belongs to the Lord ; it is holy
to the Lord .
31If a man redeems any of his tithe, he
must add a fifth of the value to it.
32The entire tithe of the herd and flockevery
tenth animal that passes under
the shepherd's rod-will be holy to the
Lord .
33He must not pick out the good from the
bad or make any substitution. If he does
make a substitution, both the animal and
its substitute become holy and cannot
be redeemed.' "
34These are the commands the Lord
gave Moses on Mount Sinai for the
Israelites.
Numbers
1The Lord spoke to Moses in the Tent
of Meeting in the Desert of Sinai on the
first day of the second month of the
second year after the Israelites came
out of Egypt. He said:
2"Take a census of the whole Israelite
community by their clans and families,
listing every man by name, one by one.
3You and Aaron are to number by their
divisions all the men in Israel twenty
years old or more who are able to serve
in the army.
4One man from each tribe, each the
head of his family, is to help you.
5These are the names of the men who
are to assist you: from Reuben, Elizur
son of Shedeur;
6from Simeon, Shelumiel son of
Zurishaddai;
7from Judah, Nahshon son of
Amminadab;
8from Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar;
9from Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon;
10from the sons of Joseph: from Ephraim,
Elishama son of Ammihud; from
Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur;
11from Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni;
12from Dan, Ahiezer son of
Ammishaddai;
13from Asher, Pagiel son of Ocran;
14from Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel;
15from Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan."
16These were the men appointed from
the community, the leaders of their
ancestral tribes. They were the heads of
the clans of Israel.
17Moses and Aaron took these men
whose names had been given,
18and they called the whole community
together on the first day of the second
month. The people indicated their
ancestry by their clans and families, and
the men twenty years old or more were
listed by name, one by one,
19as the Lord commanded Moses. And
so he counted them in the Desert of
Sinai:
20From the descendants of Reuben the
firstborn son of Israel: All the men
twenty years old or more who were able
to serve in the army were listed by name,
one by one, according to the records of
their clans and families.
21The number from the tribe of Reuben
was 46,500.
22From the descendants of Simeon: All
the men twenty years old or more who
were able to serve in the army were
counted and listed by name, one by one,
according to the records of their clans
and families.
23The number from the tribe of Simeon
was 59,300.
24From the descendants of Gad: All the
men twenty years old or more who were
able to serve in the army were listed by
name, according to the records of their
clans and families.
25The number from the tribe of Gad was
45,650.
26From the descendants of Judah: All
the men twenty years old or more who
were able to serve in the army were
listed by name, according to the records
of their clans and families.
27The number from the tribe of Judah
was 74,600.
28From the descendants of Issachar: All
the men twenty years old or more who
were able to serve in the army were
listed by name, according to the records
of their clans and families.
29The number from the tribe of Issachar
was 54,400.
30From the descendants of Zebulun: All
the men twenty years old or more who
were able to serve in the army were
listed by name, according to the records
of their clans and families.
31The number from the tribe of Zebulun
was 57,400.
32From the sons of Joseph: From the
descendants of Ephraim: All the men
twenty years old or more who were able
to serve in the army were listed by name,
according to the records of their clans
and families.
33The number from the tribe of Ephraim
was 40,500.
34From the descendants of Manasseh:
All the men twenty years old or more
who were able to serve in the army were
listed by name, according to the records
of their clans and families.
35The number from the tribe of
Manasseh was 32,200.
36From the descendants of Benjamin: All
the men twenty years old or more who
were able to serve in the army were
listed by name, according to the records
of their clans and families.
37The number from the tribe of Benjamin
was 35,400.
38From the descendants of Dan: All the
men twenty years old or more who were
able to serve in the army were listed by
name, according to the records of their
clans and families.
39The number from the tribe of Dan was
62,700.
40From the descendants of Asher: All
the men twenty years old or more who
were able to serve in the army were
listed by name, according to the records
of their clans and families.
41The number from the tribe of Asher
was 41,500.
42From the descendants of Naphtali: All
the men twenty years old or more who
were able to serve in the army were
listed by name, according to the records
of their clans and families.
43The number from the tribe of Naphtali
was 53,400.
44These were the men counted by
Moses and Aaron and the twelve
leaders of Israel, each one representing
his family.
45All the Israelites twenty years old or
more who were able to serve in Israel's
army were counted according to their
families.
46The total number was 603,550.
47The families of the tribe of Levi,
however, were not counted along with
the others.
48The Lord had said to Moses:
49"You must not count the tribe of Levi or
include them in the census of the other
Israelites.
50Instead, appoint the Levites to be in
charge of the tabernacle of the
Testimony-over all its furnishings and
everything belonging to it. They are to
carry the tabernacle and all its
furnishings; they are to take care of it
and encamp around it.
51Whenever the tabernacle is to move,
the Levites are to take it down, and
whenever the tabernacle is to be set up,
the Levites shall do it. Anyone else who
goes near it shall be put to death.
52The Israelites are to set up their tents
by divisions, each man in his own camp
under his own standard.
53The Levites, however, are to set up
their tents around the tabernacle of the
Testimony so that wrath will not fall on
the Israelite community. The Levites are
to be responsible for the care of the
tabernacle of the Testimony."
54The Israelites did all this just as the
Lord commanded Moses.
2The Lord said to Moses and Aaron:
2"The Israelites are to camp around the
Tent of Meeting some distance from it,
each man under his standard with the
banners of his family."
3On the east, toward the sunrise, the
divisions of the camp of Judah are to
encamp under their standard. The
leader of the people of Judah is
Nahshon son of Amminadab.
4His division numbers 74,600.
5The tribe of Issachar will camp next to
them. The leader of the people of
Issachar is Nethanel son of Zuar.
6His division numbers 54,400.
7The tribe of Zebulun will be next. The
leader of the people of Zebulun is Eliab
son of Helon.
8His division numbers 57,400.
9All the men assigned to the camp of
Judah, according to their divisions,
number 186,400. They will set out first.
10On the south will be the divisions of
the camp of Reuben under their
standard. The leader of the people of
Reuben is Elizur son of Shedeur.
11His division numbers 46,500.
12The tribe of Simeon will camp next to
them. The leader of the people of
Simeon is Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai.
13His division numbers 59,300.
14The tribe of Gad will be next. The
leader of the people of Gad is Eliasaph
son of Deuel.
15His division numbers 45,650.
16All the men assigned to the camp of
Reuben, according to their divisions,
number 151,450. They will set out
second.
17Then the Tent of Meeting and the
camp of the Levites will set out in the
middle of the camps. They will set out in
the same order as they encamp, each in
his own place under his standard.
18On the west will be the divisions of the
camp of Ephraim under their standard.
The leader of the people of Ephraim is
Elishama son of Ammihud.
19His division numbers 40,500.
20The tribe of Manasseh will be next to
them. The leader of the people of
Manasseh is Gamaliel son of Pedahzur.
21His division numbers 32,200.
22The tribe of Benjamin will be next. The
leader of the people of Benjamin is
Abidan son of Gideoni.
23His division numbers 35,400.
24All the men assigned to the camp of
Ephraim, according to their divisions,
number 108,100. They will set out third.
25On the north will be the divisions of the
camp of Dan, under their standard. The
leader of the people of Dan is Ahiezer
son of Ammishaddai.
26His division numbers 62,700.
27The tribe of Asher will camp next to
them. The leader of the people of Asher
is Pagiel son of Ocran.
28His division numbers 41,500.
29The tribe of Naphtali will be next. The
leader of the people of Naphtali is Ahira
son of Enan.
30His division numbers 53,400.
31All the men assigned to the camp of
Dan number 157,600. They will set out
last, under their standards.
32These are the Israelites, counted
according to their families. All those in
the camps, by their divisions, number
603,550.
33The Levites, however, were not
counted along with the other Israelites,
as the Lord commanded Moses.
34So the Israelites did everything the
Lord commanded Moses; that is the way
they encamped under their standards,
and that is the way they set out, each
with his clan and family.
3This is the account of the family of
Aaron and Moses at the time the Lord
talked with Moses on Mount Sinai.
2The names of the sons of Aaron were
Nadab the firstborn and Abihu, Eleazar
and Ithamar.
3Those were the names of Aaron's sons,
the anointed priests, who were ordained
to serve as priests.
4Nadab and Abihu, however, fell dead
before the Lord when they made an
offering with unauthorized fire before
him in the Desert of Sinai. They had no
sons; so only Eleazar and Ithamar
served as priests during the lifetime of
their father Aaron.
5The Lord said to Moses,
6"Bring the tribe of Levi and present
them to Aaron the priest to assist him.
7They are to perform duties for him and
for the whole community at the Tent of
Meeting by doing the work of the
tabernacle.
8They are to take care of all the
furnishings of the Tent of Meeting,
fulfilling the obligations of the Israelites
by doing the work of the tabernacle.
9Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons;
they are the Israelites who are to be
given wholly to him.
10Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve
as priests; anyone else who approaches
the sanctuary must be put to death."
11The Lord also said to Moses,
12"I have taken the Levites from among
the Israelites in place of the first male
offspring of every Israelite woman. The
Levites are mine,
13for all the firstborn are mine. When I
struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I
set apart for myself every firstborn in
Israel, whether man or animal. They are
to be mine. I am the Lord ."
14The Lord said to Moses in the Desert
of Sinai,
15"Count the Levites by their families
and clans. Count every male a month
old or more."
16So Moses counted them, as he was
commanded by the word of the Lord .
17These were the names of the sons of
Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari.
18These were the names of the
Gershonite clans: Libni and Shimei.
19The Kohathite clans: Amram, Izhar,
Hebron and Uzziel.
20The Merarite clans: Mahli and Mushi.
These were the Levite clans, according
to their families.
21To Gershon belonged the clans of the
Libnites and Shimeites; these were the
Gershonite clans.
22The number of all the males a month
old or more who were counted was
7,500.
23The Gershonite clans were to camp on
the west, behind the tabernacle.
24The leader of the families of the
Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael.
25At the Tent of Meeting the Gershonites
were responsible for the care of the
tabernacle and tent, its coverings, the
curtain at the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting,
26the curtains of the courtyard, the
curtain at the entrance to the courtyard
surrounding the tabernacle and altar,
and the ropes-and everything related to
their use.
27To Kohath belonged the clans of the
Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites and
Uzzielites; these were the Kohathite
clans.
28The number of all the males a month
old or more was 8,600. The Kohathites
were responsible for the care of the
sanctuary.
29The Kohathite clans were to camp on
the south side of the tabernacle.
30The leader of the families of the
Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of
Uzziel.
31They were responsible for the care of
the ark, the table, the lampstand, the
altars, the articles of the sanctuary used
in ministering, the curtain, and
everything related to their use.
32The chief leader of the Levites was
Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest. He was
appointed over those who were
responsible for the care of the sanctuary.
33To Merari belonged the clans of the
Mahlites and the Mushites; these were
the Merarite clans.
34The number of all the males a month
old or more who were counted was
6,200.
35The leader of the families of the
Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail;
they were to camp on the north side of
the tabernacle.
36The Merarites were appointed to take
care of the frames of the tabernacle, its
crossbars, posts, bases, all its
equipment, and everything related to
their use,
37as well as the posts of the surrounding
courtyard with their bases, tent pegs
and ropes.
38Moses and Aaron and his sons were
to camp to the east of the tabernacle,
toward the sunrise, in front of the Tent of
Meeting. They were responsible for the
care of the sanctuary on behalf of the
Israelites. Anyone else who approached
the sanctuary was to be put to death.
39The total number of Levites counted at
the Lord 's command by Moses and
Aaron according to their clans, including
every male a month old or more, was
22,000.
40The Lord said to Moses, "Count all the
firstborn Israelite males who are a
month old or more and make a list of
their names.
41Take the Levites for me in place of all
the firstborn of the Israelites, and the
livestock of the Levites in place of all the
firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites.
I am the Lord ."
42So Moses counted all the firstborn of
the Israelites, as the Lord commanded
him.
43The total number of firstborn males a
month old or more, listed by name, was
22,273.
44The Lord also said to Moses,
45"Take the Levites in place of all the
firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of
the Levites in place of their livestock.
The Levites are to be mine. I am the
Lord .
46To redeem the 273 firstborn Israelites
who exceed the number of the Levites,
47collect five shekels for each one,
according to the sanctuary shekel,
which weighs twenty gerahs.
48Give the money for the redemption of
the additional Israelites to Aaron and his
sons."
49So Moses collected the redemption
money from those who exceeded the
number redeemed by the Levites.
50From the firstborn of the Israelites he
collected silver weighing 1,365 shekels,
according to the sanctuary shekel.
51Moses gave the redemption money to
Aaron and his sons, as he was
commanded by the word of the Lord .
4The Lord said to Moses and Aaron:
2"Take a census of the Kohathite branch
of the Levites by their clans and families.
3Count all the men from thirty to fifty
years of age who come to serve in the
work in the Tent of Meeting.
4"This is the work of the Kohathites in
the Tent of Meeting: the care of the
most holy things.
5When the camp is to move, Aaron and
his sons are to go in and take down the
shielding curtain and cover the ark of
the Testimony with it.
6Then they are to cover this with hides
of sea cows, spread a cloth of solid blue
over that and put the poles in place.
7"Over the table of the Presence they
are to spread a blue cloth and put on it
the plates, dishes and bowls, and the
jars for drink offerings; the bread that is
continually there is to remain on it.
8Over these they are to spread a scarlet
cloth, cover that with hides of sea cows
and put its poles in place.
9"They are to take a blue cloth and
cover the lampstand that is for light,
together with its lamps, its wick trimmers
and trays, and all its jars for the oil used
to supply it.
10Then they are to wrap it and all its
accessories in a covering of hides of
sea cows and put it on a carrying frame.
11"Over the gold altar they are to spread
a blue cloth and cover that with hides of
sea cows and put its poles in place.
12"They are to take all the articles used
for ministering in the sanctuary, wrap
them in a blue cloth, cover that with
hides of sea cows and put them on a
carrying frame.
13"They are to remove the ashes from
the bronze altar and spread a purple
cloth over it.
14Then they are to place on it all the
utensils used for ministering at the altar,
including the firepans, meat forks,
shovels and sprinkling bowls. Over it
they are to spread a covering of hides of
sea cows and put its poles in place.
15"After Aaron and his sons have
finished covering the holy furnishings
and all the holy articles, and when the
camp is ready to move, the Kohathites
are to come to do the carrying. But they
must not touch the holy things or they
will die. The Kohathites are to carry
those things that are in the Tent of
Meeting.
16"Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, is to
have charge of the oil for the light, the
fragrant incense, the regular grain
offering and the anointing oil. He is to be
in charge of the entire tabernacle and
everything in it, including its holy
furnishings and articles."
17The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
18"See that the Kohathite tribal clans are
not cut off from the Levites.
19So that they may live and not die when
they come near the most holy things, do
this for them: Aaron and his sons are to
go into the sanctuary and assign to each
man his work and what he is to carry.
20But the Kohathites must not go in to
look at the holy things, even for a
moment, or they will die."
21The Lord said to Moses,
22"Take a census also of the
Gershonites by their families and clans.
23Count all the men from thirty to fifty
years of age who come to serve in the
work at the Tent of Meeting.
24"This is the service of the Gershonite
clans as they work and carry burdens:
25They are to carry the curtains of the
tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, its
covering and the outer covering of hides
of sea cows, the curtains for the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
26the curtains of the courtyard
surrounding the tabernacle and altar,
the curtain for the entrance, the ropes
and all the equipment used in its service.
The Gershonites are to do all that needs
to be done with these things.
27All their service, whether carrying or
doing other work, is to be done under
the direction of Aaron and his sons. You
shall assign to them as their
responsibility all they are to carry.
28This is the service of the Gershonite
clans at the Tent of Meeting. Their
duties are to be under the direction of
Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.
29"Count the Merarites by their clans and
families.
30Count all the men from thirty to fifty
years of age who come to serve in the
work at the Tent of Meeting.
31This is their duty as they perform
service at the Tent of Meeting: to carry
the frames of the tabernacle, its
crossbars, posts and bases,
32as well as the posts of the surrounding
courtyard with their bases, tent pegs,
ropes, all their equipment and
everything related to their use. Assign to
each man the specific things he is to
carry.
33This is the service of the Merarite
clans as they work at the Tent of
Meeting under the direction of Ithamar
son of Aaron, the priest."
34Moses, Aaron and the leaders of the
community counted the Kohathites by
their clans and families.
35All the men from thirty to fifty years of
age who came to serve in the work in
the Tent of Meeting,
36counted by clans, were 2,750.
37This was the total of all those in the
Kohathite clans who served in the Tent
of Meeting. Moses and Aaron counted
them according to the Lord 's command
through Moses.
38The Gershonites were counted by their
clans and families.
39All the men from thirty to fifty years of
age who came to serve in the work at
the Tent of Meeting,
40counted by their clans and families,
were 2,630.
41This was the total of those in the
Gershonite clans who served at the Tent
of Meeting. Moses and Aaron counted
them according to the Lord 's command.
42The Merarites were counted by their
clans and families.
43All the men from thirty to fifty years of
age who came to serve in the work at
the Tent of Meeting,
44counted by their clans, were 3,200.
45This was the total of those in the
Merarite clans. Moses and Aaron
counted them according to the Lord 's
command through Moses.
46So Moses, Aaron and the leaders of
Israel counted all the Levites by their
clans and families.
47All the men from thirty to fifty years of
age who came to do the work of serving
and carrying the Tent of Meeting
48numbered 8,580.
49At the Lord 's command through
Moses, each was assigned his work and
told what to carry. Thus they were
counted, as the Lord commanded
Moses.
5The Lord said to Moses,
2"Command the Israelites to send away
from the camp anyone who has an
infectious skin disease or a discharge of
any kind, or who is ceremonially unclean
because of a dead body.
3Send away male and female alike;
send them outside the camp so they will
not defile their camp, where I dwell
among them."
4The Israelites did this; they sent them
outside the camp. They did just as the
Lord had instructed Moses.
5The Lord said to Moses,
6"Say to the Israelites: 'When a man or
woman wrongs another in any way and
so is unfaithful to the Lord , that person
is guilty
7and must confess the sin he has
committed. He must make full restitution
for his wrong, add one fifth to it and give
it all to the person he has wronged.
8But if that person has no close relative
to whom restitution can be made for the
wrong, the restitution belongs to the
Lord and must be given to the priest,
along with the ram with which
atonement is made for him.
9All the sacred contributions the
Israelites bring to a priest will belong to
him.
10Each man's sacred gifts are his own,
but what he gives to the priest will
belong to the priest.' "
11Then the Lord said to Moses,
12"Speak to the Israelites and say to
them: 'If a man's wife goes astray and is
unfaithful to him
13by sleeping with another man, and this
is hidden from her husband and her
impurity is undetected (since there is no
witness against her and she has not
been caught in the act),
14and if feelings of jealousy come over
her husband and he suspects his wife
and she is impure-or if he is jealous and
suspects her even though she is not
impure-
15then he is to take his wife to the priest.
He must also take an offering of a tenth
of an ephah of barley flour on her behalf.
He must not pour oil on it or put incense
on it, because it is a grain offering for
jealousy, a reminder offering to draw
attention to guilt.
16" 'The priest shall bring her and have
her stand before the Lord .
17Then he shall take some holy water in
a clay jar and put some dust from the
tabernacle floor into the water.
18After the priest has had the woman
stand before the Lord , he shall loosen
her hair and place in her hands the
reminder offering, the grain offering for
jealousy, while he himself holds the
bitter water that brings a curse.
19Then the priest shall put the woman
under oath and say to her, "If no other
man has slept with you and you have
not gone astray and become impure
while married to your husband, may this
bitter water that brings a curse not harm
you.
20But if you have gone astray while
married to your husband and you have
defiled yourself by sleeping with a man
other than your husband"-
21here the priest is to put the woman
under this curse of the oath-"may the
Lord cause your people to curse and
denounce you when he causes your
thigh to waste away and your abdomen
to swell.
22May this water that brings a curse
enter your body so that your abdomen
swells and your thigh wastes away. " "
'Then the woman is to say, "Amen. So
be it."
23" 'The priest is to write these curses on
a scroll and then wash them off into the
bitter water.
24He shall have the woman drink the
bitter water that brings a curse, and this
water will enter her and cause bitter
suffering.
25The priest is to take from her hands
the grain offering for jealousy, wave it
before the Lord and bring it to the altar.
26The priest is then to take a handful of
the grain offering as a memorial offering
and burn it on the altar; after that, he is
to have the woman drink the water.
27If she has defiled herself and been
unfaithful to her husband, then when
she is made to drink the water that
brings a curse, it will go into her and
cause bitter suffering; her abdomen will
swell and her thigh waste away, and she
will become accursed among her people.
28If, however, the woman has not defiled
herself and is free from impurity, she will
be cleared of guilt and will be able to
have children.
29" 'This, then, is the law of jealousy
when a woman goes astray and defiles
herself while married to her husband,
30or when feelings of jealousy come
over a man because he suspects his
wife. The priest is to have her stand
before the Lord and is to apply this
entire law to her.
31The husband will be innocent of any
wrongdoing, but the woman will bear the
consequences of her sin.' "
6The Lord said to Moses,
2"Speak to the Israelites and say to
them: 'If a man or woman wants to make
a special vow, a vow of separation to
the Lord as a Nazirite,
3he must abstain from wine and other
fermented drink and must not drink
vinegar made from wine or from other
fermented drink. He must not drink
grape juice or eat grapes or raisins.
4As long as he is a Nazirite, he must not
eat anything that comes from the
grapevine, not even the seeds or skins.
5" 'During the entire period of his vow of
separation no razor may be used on his
head. He must be holy until the period of
his separation to the Lord is over; he
must let the hair of his head grow long.
6Throughout the period of his separation
to the Lord he must not go near a dead
body.
7Even if his own father or mother or
brother or sister dies, he must not make
himself ceremonially unclean on
account of them, because the symbol of
his separation to God is on his head.
8Throughout the period of his separation
he is consecrated to the Lord .
9" 'If someone dies suddenly in his
presence, thus defiling the hair he has
dedicated, he must shave his head on
the day of his cleansing-the seventh day.
10Then on the eighth day he must bring
two doves or two young pigeons to the
priest at the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting.
11The priest is to offer one as a sin
offering and the other as a burnt offering
to make atonement for him because he
sinned by being in the presence of the
dead body. That same day he is to
consecrate his head.
12He must dedicate himself to the Lord
for the period of his separation and must
bring a year-old male lamb as a guilt
offering. The previous days do not count,
because he became defiled during his
separation.
13" 'Now this is the law for the Nazirite
when the period of his separation is over.
He is to be brought to the entrance to
the Tent of Meeting.
14There he is to present his offerings to
the Lord : a year-old male lamb without
defect for a burnt offering, a year-old
ewe lamb without defect for a sin
offering, a ram without defect for a
fellowship offering,
15together with their grain offerings and
drink offerings, and a basket of bread
made without yeast-cakes made of fine
flour mixed with oil, and wafers spread
with oil.
16" 'The priest is to present them before
the Lord and make the sin offering and
the burnt offering.
17He is to present the basket of
unleavened bread and is to sacrifice the
ram as a fellowship offering to the Lord ,
together with its grain offering and drink
offering.
18" 'Then at the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting, the Nazirite must shave off the
hair that he dedicated. He is to take the
hair and put it in the fire that is under the
sacrifice of the fellowship offering.
19" 'After the Nazirite has shaved off the
hair of his dedication, the priest is to
place in his hands a boiled shoulder of
the ram, and a cake and a wafer from
the basket, both made without yeast.
20The priest shall then wave them before
the Lord as a wave offering; they are
holy and belong to the priest, together
with the breast that was waved and the
thigh that was presented. After that, the
Nazirite may drink wine.
21" 'This is the law of the Nazirite who
vows his offering to the Lord in
accordance with his separation, in
addition to whatever else he can afford.
He must fulfill the vow he has made,
according to the law of the Nazirite.' "
22The Lord said to Moses,
23"Tell Aaron and his sons, 'This is how
you are to bless the Israelites. Say to
them:
24" ' "The Lord bless you and keep you;
25the Lord make his face shine upon you
and be gracious to you;
26the Lord turn his face toward you and
give you peace." '
27"So they will put my name on the
Israelites, and I will bless them."
7When Moses finished setting up the
tabernacle, he anointed it and
consecrated it and all its furnishings. He
also anointed and consecrated the altar
and all its utensils.
2Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of
families who were the tribal leaders in
charge of those who were counted,
made offerings.
3They brought as their gifts before the
Lord six covered carts and twelve oxenan
ox from each leader and a cart from
every two. These they presented before
the tabernacle.
4The Lord said to Moses,
5"Accept these from them, that they may
be used in the work at the Tent of
Meeting. Give them to the Levites as
each man's work requires."
6So Moses took the carts and oxen and
gave them to the Levites.
7He gave two carts and four oxen to the
Gershonites, as their work required,
8and he gave four carts and eight oxen
to the Merarites, as their work required.
They were all under the direction of
Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.
9But Moses did not give any to the
Kohathites, because they were to carry
on their shoulders the holy things, for
which they were responsible.
10When the altar was anointed, the
leaders brought their offerings for its
dedication and presented them before
the altar.
11For the Lord had said to Moses, "Each
day one leader is to bring his offering for
the dedication of the altar."
12The one who brought his offering on
the first day was Nahshon son of
Amminadab of the tribe of Judah.

be sacrificed as a fellowship offering.
This was the offering of Ahiezer son of
Ammishaddai.
72On the eleventh day Pagiel son of
Ocran, the leader of the people of Asher,
brought his offering.
73His offering was one silver plate
weighing a hundred and thirty shekels,

This was the offering of Pagiel son of
Ocran.
78On the twelfth day Ahira son of Enan,
the leader of the people of Naphtali,
brought his offering.
79His offering was one silver plate
weighing a hundred and thirty shekels,
and one silver sprinkling bowl weighing
seventy shekels, both according to the
sanctuary shekel, each filled with fine
flour mixed with oil as a grain offering;

This was the offering of Ahira son of
Enan.
84These were the offerings of the
Israelite leaders for the dedication of the
altar when it was anointed: twelve silver
plates, twelve silver sprinkling bowls and
twelve gold dishes.
85Each silver plate weighed a hundred
and thirty shekels, and each sprinkling
bowl seventy shekels. Altogether, the
silver dishes weighed two thousand four
hundred shekels, according to the
sanctuary shekel.
86The twelve gold dishes filled with
incense weighed ten shekels each,
according to the sanctuary shekel.
Altogether, the gold dishes weighed a

87The total number of animals for the
burnt offering came to twelve young
bulls, twelve rams and twelve male
lambs a year old, together with their
grain offering. Twelve male goats were
used for the sin offering.
88The total number of animals for the
sacrifice of the fellowship offering came
to twenty-four oxen, sixty rams, sixty
male goats and sixty male lambs a year
old. These were the offerings for the
dedication of the altar after it was
anointed.
89When Moses entered the Tent of
Meeting to speak with the Lord , he
heard the voice speaking to him from
between the two cherubim above the
atonement cover on the ark of the
Testimony. And he spoke with him.
8The Lord said to Moses,
2"Speak to Aaron and say to him, 'When
you set up the seven lamps, they are to
light the area in front of the lampstand.' "
3Aaron did so; he set up the lamps so
that they faced forward on the
lampstand, just as the Lord commanded
Moses.
4This is how the lampstand was made: It
was made of hammered gold-from its
base to its blossoms. The lampstand
was made exactly like the pattern the
Lord had shown Moses.
5The Lord said to Moses:
6"Take the Levites from among the other
Israelites and make them ceremonially
clean.
7To purify them, do this: Sprinkle the
water of cleansing on them; then have
them shave their whole bodies and
wash their clothes, and so purify
themselves.
8Have them take a young bull with its
grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil;
then you are to take a second young
bull for a sin offering.
9Bring the Levites to the front of the Tent
of Meeting and assemble the whole
Israelite community.
10You are to bring the Levites before the
Lord , and the Israelites are to lay their
hands on them.
11Aaron is to present the Levites before
the Lord as a wave offering from the
Israelites, so that they may be ready to
do the work of the Lord .
12"After the Levites lay their hands on
the heads of the bulls, use the one for a
sin offering to the Lord and the other for
a burnt offering, to make atonement for
the Levites.
13Have the Levites stand in front of
Aaron and his sons and then present
them as a wave offering to the Lord .
14In this way you are to set the Levites
apart from the other Israelites, and the
Levites will be mine.
15"After you have purified the Levites
and presented them as a wave offering,
they are to come to do their work at the
Tent of Meeting.
16They are the Israelites who are to be
given wholly to me. I have taken them
as my own in place of the firstborn, the
first male offspring from every Israelite
woman.
17Every firstborn male in Israel, whether
man or animal, is mine. When I struck
down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set
them apart for myself.
18And I have taken the Levites in place
of all the firstborn sons in Israel.
19Of all the Israelites, I have given the
Levites as gifts to Aaron and his sons to
do the work at the Tent of Meeting on
behalf of the Israelites and to make
atonement for them so that no plague
will strike the Israelites when they go
near the sanctuary."
20Moses, Aaron and the whole Israelite
community did with the Levites just as
the Lord commanded Moses.
21The Levites purified themselves and
washed their clothes. Then Aaron
presented them as a wave offering
before the Lord and made atonement for
them to purify them.
22After that, the Levites came to do their
work at the Tent of Meeting under the
supervision of Aaron and his sons. They
did with the Levites just as the Lord
commanded Moses.
23The Lord said to Moses,
24"This applies to the Levites: Men
twenty-five years old or more shall come
to take part in the work at the Tent of
Meeting,
25but at the age of fifty, they must retire
from their regular service and work no
longer.
26They may assist their brothers in
performing their duties at the Tent of
Meeting, but they themselves must not
do the work. This, then, is how you are
to assign the responsibilities of the
Levites."
9The Lord spoke to Moses in the
Desert of Sinai in the first month of the
second year after they came out of
Egypt. He said,
2"Have the Israelites celebrate the
Passover at the appointed time.
3Celebrate it at the appointed time, at
twilight on the fourteenth day of this
month, in accordance with all its rules
and regulations."
4So Moses told the Israelites to
celebrate the Passover,
5and they did so in the Desert of Sinai at
twilight on the fourteenth day of the first
month. The Israelites did everything just
as the Lord commanded Moses.
6But some of them could not celebrate
the Passover on that day because they
were ceremonially unclean on account
of a dead body. So they came to Moses
and Aaron that same day
7and said to Moses, "We have become
unclean because of a dead body, but
why should we be kept from presenting
the Lord 's offering with the other
Israelites at the appointed time?"
8Moses answered them, "Wait until I find
out what the Lord commands
concerning you."
9Then the Lord said to Moses,
10"Tell the Israelites: 'When any of you
or your descendants are unclean
because of a dead body or are away on
a journey, they may still celebrate the
Lord 's Passover.
11They are to celebrate it on the
fourteenth day of the second month at
twilight. They are to eat the lamb,
together with unleavened bread and
bitter herbs.
12They must not leave any of it till
morning or break any of its bones.
When they celebrate the Passover, they
must follow all the regulations.
13But if a man who is ceremonially clean
and not on a journey fails to celebrate
the Passover, that person must be cut
off from his people because he did not
present the Lord 's offering at the
appointed time. That man will bear the
consequences of his sin.
14" 'An alien living among you who wants
to celebrate the Lord 's Passover must
do so in accordance with its rules and
regulations. You must have the same
regulations for the alien and the nativeborn.'
"
15On the day the tabernacle, the Tent of
the Testimony, was set up, the cloud
covered it. From evening till morning the
cloud above the tabernacle looked like
fire.
16That is how it continued to be; the
cloud covered it, and at night it looked
like fire.
17Whenever the cloud lifted from above
the Tent, the Israelites set out; wherever
the cloud settled, the Israelites
encamped.
18At the Lord 's command the Israelites
set out, and at his command they
encamped. As long as the cloud stayed
over the tabernacle, they remained in
camp.
19When the cloud remained over the
tabernacle a long time, the Israelites
obeyed the Lord 's order and did not set
out.
20Sometimes the cloud was over the
tabernacle only a few days; at the Lord
's command they would encamp, and
then at his command they would set out.
21Sometimes the cloud stayed only from
evening till morning, and when it lifted in
the morning, they set out. Whether by
day or by night, whenever the cloud
lifted, they set out.
22Whether the cloud stayed over the
tabernacle for two days or a month or a
year, the Israelites would remain in
camp and not set out; but when it lifted,
they would set out.
23At the Lord 's command they
encamped, and at the Lord 's command
they set out. They obeyed the Lord 's
order, in accordance with his command
through Moses.
10The Lord said to Moses:
2"Make two trumpets of hammered silver,
and use them for calling the community
together and for having the camps set
out.
3When both are sounded, the whole
community is to assemble before you at
the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
4If only one is sounded, the leaders-the
heads of the clans of Israel-are to
assemble before you.
5When a trumpet blast is sounded, the
tribes camping on the east are to set out.
6At the sounding of a second blast, the
camps on the south are to set out. The
blast will be the signal for setting out.
7To gather the assembly, blow the
trumpets, but not with the same signal.
8"The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to
blow the trumpets. This is to be a lasting
ordinance for you and the generations to
come.
9When you go into battle in your own
land against an enemy who is
oppressing you, sound a blast on the
trumpets. Then you will be remembered
by the Lord your God and rescued from
your enemies.
10Also at your times of rejoicing-your
appointed feasts and New Moon
festivals-you are to sound the trumpets
over your burnt offerings and fellowship
offerings, and they will be a memorial for
you before your God. I am the Lord your
God."
11On the twentieth day of the second
month of the second year, the cloud
lifted from above the tabernacle of the
Testimony.
12Then the Israelites set out from the
Desert of Sinai and traveled from place
to place until the cloud came to rest in
the Desert of Paran.
13They set out, this first time, at the Lord
's command through Moses.
14The divisions of the camp of Judah
went first, under their standard.
Nahshon son of Amminadab was in
command.
15Nethanel son of Zuar was over the
division of the tribe of Issachar,
16and Eliab son of Helon was over the
division of the tribe of Zebulun.
17Then the tabernacle was taken down,
and the Gershonites and Merarites, who
carried it, set out.
18The divisions of the camp of Reuben
went next, under their standard. Elizur
son of Shedeur was in command.
19Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over
the division of the tribe of Simeon,
20and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over
the division of the tribe of Gad.
21Then the Kohathites set out, carrying
the holy things. The tabernacle was to
be set up before they arrived.
22The divisions of the camp of Ephraim
went next, under their standard.
Elishama son of Ammihud was in
command.
23Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over
the division of the tribe of Manasseh,
24and Abidan son of Gideoni was over
the division of the tribe of Benjamin.
25Finally, as the rear guard for all the
units, the divisions of the camp of Dan
set out, under their standard. Ahiezer
son of Ammishaddai was in command.
26Pagiel son of Ocran was over the
division of the tribe of Asher,
27and Ahira son of Enan was over the
division of the tribe of Naphtali.
28This was the order of march for the
Israelite divisions as they set out.
29Now Moses said to Hobab son of
Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-inlaw,
"We are setting out for the place
about which the Lord said, 'I will give it
to you.' Come with us and we will treat
you well, for the Lord has promised
good things to Israel."
30He answered, "No, I will not go; I am
going back to my own land and my own
people."
31But Moses said, "Please do not leave
us. You know where we should camp in
the desert, and you can be our eyes.
32If you come with us, we will share with
you whatever good things the Lord gives
us."
33So they set out from the mountain of
the Lord and traveled for three days.
The ark of the covenant of the Lord went
before them during those three days to
find them a place to rest.
34The cloud of the Lord was over them
by day when they set out from the camp.
35Whenever the ark set out, Moses said,
"Rise up, O Lord ! May your enemies be
scattered; may your foes flee before
you."
36Whenever it came to rest, he said,
"Return, O Lord , to the countless
thousands of Israel."
11Now the people complained about
their hardships in the hearing of the
Lord , and when he heard them his
anger was aroused. Then fire from the
Lord burned among them and
consumed some of the outskirts of the
camp.
2When the people cried out to Moses,
he prayed to the Lord and the fire died
down.
3So that place was called Taberah,
because fire from the Lord had burned
among them. Quail From the Lord
4The rabble with them began to crave
other food, and again the Israelites
started wailing and said, "If only we had
meat to eat!
5We remember the fish we ate in Egypt
at no cost-also the cucumbers, melons,
leeks, onions and garlic.
6But now we have lost our appetite; we
never see anything but this manna!"
7The manna was like coriander seed
and looked like resin.
8The people went around gathering it,
and then ground it in a handmill or
crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in
a pot or made it into cakes. And it tasted
like something made with olive oil.
9When the dew settled on the camp at
night, the manna also came down.
10Moses heard the people of every
family wailing, each at the entrance to
his tent. The Lord became exceedingly
angry, and Moses was troubled.
11He asked the Lord , "Why have you
brought this trouble on your servant?
What have I done to displease you that
you put the burden of all these people
on me?
12Did I conceive all these people? Did I
give them birth? Why do you tell me to
carry them in my arms, as a nurse
carries an infant, to the land you
promised on oath to their forefathers?
13Where can I get meat for all these
people? They keep wailing to me, 'Give
us meat to eat!'
14I cannot carry all these people by
myself; the burden is too heavy for me.
15If this is how you are going to treat me,
put me to death right now-if I have found
favor in your eyes-and do not let me
face my own ruin."
16The Lord said to Moses: "Bring me
seventy of Israel's elders who are known
to you as leaders and officials among
the people. Have them come to the Tent
of Meeting, that they may stand there
with you.
17I will come down and speak with you
there, and I will take of the Spirit that is
on you and put the Spirit on them. They
will help you carry the burden of the
people so that you will not have to carry
it alone.
18"Tell the people: 'Consecrate
yourselves in preparation for tomorrow,
when you will eat meat. The Lord heard
you when you wailed, "If only we had
meat to eat! We were better off in
Egypt!" Now the Lord will give you meat,
and you will eat it.
19You will not eat it for just one day, or
two days, or five, ten or twenty days,
20but for a whole month-until it comes
out of your nostrils and you loathe itbecause
you have rejected the Lord ,
who is among you, and have wailed
before him, saying, "Why did we ever
leave Egypt?" ' "
21But Moses said, "Here I am among six
hundred thousand men on foot, and you
say, 'I will give them meat to eat for a
whole month!'
22Would they have enough if flocks and
herds were slaughtered for them?
Would they have enough if all the fish in
the sea were caught for them?"
23The Lord answered Moses, "Is the
Lord 's arm too short? You will now see
whether or not what I say will come true
for you."
24So Moses went out and told the
people what the Lord had said. He
brought together seventy of their elders
and had them stand around the Tent.
25Then the Lord came down in the cloud
and spoke with him, and he took of the
Spirit that was on him and put the Spirit
on the seventy elders. When the Spirit
rested on them, they prophesied, but
they did not do so again.
26However, two men, whose names
were Eldad and Medad, had remained
in the camp. They were listed among
the elders, but did not go out to the Tent.
Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and
they prophesied in the camp.
27A young man ran and told Moses,
"Eldad and Medad are prophesying in
the camp."
28Joshua son of Nun, who had been
Moses' aide since youth, spoke up and
said, "Moses, my lord, stop them!"
29But Moses replied, "Are you jealous for
my sake? I wish that all the Lord 's
people were prophets and that the Lord
would put his Spirit on them!"
30Then Moses and the elders of Israel
returned to the camp.
31Now a wind went out from the Lord
and drove quail in from the sea. It
brought them down all around the camp
to about three feet above the ground, as
far as a day's walk in any direction.
32All that day and night and all the next
day the people went out and gathered
quail. No one gathered less than ten
homers. Then they spread them out all
around the camp.
33But while the meat was still between
their teeth and before it could be
consumed, the anger of the Lord burned
against the people, and he struck them
with a severe plague.
34Therefore the place was named
Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they
buried the people who had craved other
food.
35From Kibroth Hattaavah the people
traveled to Hazeroth and stayed there.
12Miriam and Aaron began to talk
against Moses because of his Cushite
wife, for he had married a Cushite.
2"Has the Lord spoken only through
Moses?" they asked. "Hasn't he also
spoken through us?" And the Lord heard
this.
3(Now Moses was a very humble man,
more humble than anyone else on the
face of the earth.)
4At once the Lord said to Moses, Aaron
and Miriam, "Come out to the Tent of
Meeting, all three of you." So the three
of them came out.
5Then the Lord came down in a pillar of
cloud; he stood at the entrance to the
Tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam.
When both of them stepped forward,
6he said, "Listen to my words: "When a
prophet of the Lord is among you, I
reveal myself to him in visions, I speak
to him in dreams.
7But this is not true of my servant
Moses; he is faithful in all my house.
8With him I speak face to face, clearly
and not in riddles; he sees the form of
the Lord . Why then were you not afraid
to speak against my servant Moses?"
9The anger of the Lord burned against
them, and he left them.
10When the cloud lifted from above the
Tent, there stood Miriam-leprous, like
snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw
that she had leprosy;
11and he said to Moses, "Please, my
lord, do not hold against us the sin we
have so foolishly committed.
12Do not let her be like a stillborn infant
coming from its mother's womb with its
flesh half eaten away."
13So Moses cried out to the Lord , "O
God, please heal her!"
14The Lord replied to Moses, "If her
father had spit in her face, would she
not have been in disgrace for seven
days? Confine her outside the camp for
seven days; after that she can be
brought back."
15So Miriam was confined outside the
camp for seven days, and the people
did not move on till she was brought
back.
16After that, the people left Hazeroth and
encamped in the Desert of Paran.
13The Lord said to Moses,
2"Send some men to explore the land of
Canaan, which I am giving to the
Israelites. From each ancestral tribe
send one of its leaders."
3So at the Lord 's command Moses sent
them out from the Desert of Paran. All of
them were leaders of the Israelites.
4These are their names: from the tribe of
Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur;
5from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son
of Hori;
6from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of
Jephunneh;
7from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of
Joseph;
8from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son
of Nun;
9from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of
Raphu;
10from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son
of Sodi;
11from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of
Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi;
12from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of
Gemalli;
13from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of
Michael;
14from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of
Vophsi;
15from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of
Maki.
16These are the names of the men
Moses sent to explore the land. (Moses
gave Hoshea son of Nun the name
Joshua.)
17When Moses sent them to explore
Canaan, he said, "Go up through the
Negev and on into the hill country.
18See what the land is like and whether
the people who live there are strong or
weak, few or many.
19What kind of land do they live in? Is it
good or bad? What kind of towns do
they live in? Are they unwalled or
fortified?
20How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor?
Are there trees on it or not? Do your
best to bring back some of the fruit of
the land." (It was the season for the first
ripe grapes.)
21So they went up and explored the land
from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob,
toward Lebo Hamath.
22They went up through the Negev and
came to Hebron, where Ahiman,
Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of
Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built
seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
23When they reached the Valley of
Eshcol, they cut off a branch bearing a
single cluster of grapes. Two of them
carried it on a pole between them, along
with some pomegranates and figs.
24That place was called the Valley of
Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes
the Israelites cut off there.
25At the end of forty days they returned
from exploring the land.
26They came back to Moses and Aaron
and the whole Israelite community at
Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There
they reported to them and to the whole
assembly and showed them the fruit of
the land.
27They gave Moses this account: "We
went into the land to which you sent us,
and it does flow with milk and honey!
Here is its fruit.
28But the people who live there are
powerful, and the cities are fortified and
very large. We even saw descendants
of Anak there.
29The Amalekites live in the Negev; the
Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in
the hill country; and the Canaanites live
near the sea and along the Jordan."
30Then Caleb silenced the people before
Moses and said, "We should go up and
take possession of the land, for we can
certainly do it."
31But the men who had gone up with
him said, "We can't attack those people;
they are stronger than we are."
32And they spread among the Israelites
a bad report about the land they had
explored. They said, "The land we
explored devours those living in it. All
the people we saw there are of great
size.
33We saw the Nephilim there (the
descendants of Anak come from the
Nephilim). We seemed like
grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we
looked the same to them."
14That night all the people of the
community raised their voices and wept
aloud.
2All the Israelites grumbled against
Moses and Aaron, and the whole
assembly said to them, "If only we had
died in Egypt! Or in this desert!
3Why is the Lord bringing us to this land
only to let us fall by the sword? Our
wives and children will be taken as
plunder. Wouldn't it be better for us to
go back to Egypt?"
4And they said to each other, "We
should choose a leader and go back to
Egypt."
5Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown in
front of the whole Israelite assembly
gathered there.
6Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of
Jephunneh, who were among those who
had explored the land, tore their clothes
7and said to the entire Israelite assembly,
"The land we passed through and
explored is exceedingly good.
8If the Lord is pleased with us, he will
lead us into that land, a land flowing with
milk and honey, and will give it to us.
9Only do not rebel against the Lord .
And do not be afraid of the people of the
land, because we will swallow them up.
Their protection is gone, but the Lord is
with us. Do not be afraid of them."
10But the whole assembly talked about
stoning them. Then the glory of the Lord
appeared at the Tent of Meeting to all
the Israelites.
11The Lord said to Moses, "How long will
these people treat me with contempt?
How long will they refuse to believe in
me, in spite of all the miraculous signs I
have performed among them?
12I will strike them down with a plague
and destroy them, but I will make you
into a nation greater and stronger than
they."
13Moses said to the Lord , "Then the
Egyptians will hear about it! By your
power you brought these people up from
among them.
14And they will tell the inhabitants of this
land about it. They have already heard
that you, O Lord , are with these people
and that you, O Lord , have been seen
face to face, that your cloud stays over
them, and that you go before them in a
pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire
by night.
15If you put these people to death all at
one time, the nations who have heard
this report about you will say,
16'The Lord was not able to bring these
people into the land he promised them
on oath; so he slaughtered them in the
desert.'
17"Now may the Lord's strength be
displayed, just as you have declared:
18'The Lord is slow to anger, abounding
in love and forgiving sin and rebellion.
Yet he does not leave the guilty
unpunished; he punishes the children
for the sin of the fathers to the third and
fourth generation.'
19In accordance with your great love,
forgive the sin of these people, just as
you have pardoned them from the time
they left Egypt until now."
20The Lord replied, "I have forgiven them,
as you asked.
21Nevertheless, as surely as I live and
as surely as the glory of the Lord fills the
whole earth,
22not one of the men who saw my glory
and the miraculous signs I performed in
Egypt and in the desert but who
disobeyed me and tested me ten times-
23not one of them will ever see the land I
promised on oath to their forefathers. No
one who has treated me with contempt
will ever see it.
24But because my servant Caleb has a
different spirit and follows me
wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the
land he went to, and his descendants
will inherit it.
25Since the Amalekites and Canaanites
are living in the valleys, turn back
tomorrow and set out toward the desert
along the route to the Red Sea. "
26The Lord said to Moses and Aaron:
27"How long will this wicked community
grumble against me? I have heard the
complaints of these grumbling Israelites.
28So tell them, 'As surely as I live,
declares the Lord , I will do to you the
very things I heard you say:
29In this desert your bodies will fall-every
one of you twenty years old or more
who was counted in the census and who
has grumbled against me.
30Not one of you will enter the land I
swore with uplifted hand to make your
home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh
and Joshua son of Nun.
31As for your children that you said
would be taken as plunder, I will bring
them in to enjoy the land you have
rejected.
32But you-your bodies will fall in this
desert.
33Your children will be shepherds here
for forty years, suffering for your
unfaithfulness, until the last of your
bodies lies in the desert.
34For forty years-one year for each of
the forty days you explored the land-you
will suffer for your sins and know what it
is like to have me against you.'
35I, the Lord , have spoken, and I will
surely do these things to this whole
wicked community, which has banded
together against me. They will meet
their end in this desert; here they will
die."
36So the men Moses had sent to explore
the land, who returned and made the
whole community grumble against him
by spreading a bad report about it-
37these men responsible for spreading
the bad report about the land were
struck down and died of a plague before
the Lord .
38Of the men who went to explore the
land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb
son of Jephunneh survived.
39When Moses reported this to all the
Israelites, they mourned bitterly.
40Early the next morning they went up
toward the high hill country. "We have
sinned," they said. "We will go up to the
place the Lord promised."
41But Moses said, "Why are you
disobeying the Lord 's command? This
will not succeed!
42Do not go up, because the Lord is not
with you. You will be defeated by your
enemies,
43for the Amalekites and Canaanites will
face you there. Because you have
turned away from the Lord , he will not
be with you and you will fall by the
sword."
44Nevertheless, in their presumption
they went up toward the high hill country,
though neither Moses nor the ark of the
Lord 's covenant moved from the camp.
45Then the Amalekites and Canaanites
who lived in that hill country came down
and attacked them and beat them down
all the way to Hormah.
15The Lord said to Moses,
2"Speak to the Israelites and say to
them: 'After you enter the land I am
giving you as a home
3and you present to the Lord offerings
made by fire, from the herd or the flock,
as an aroma pleasing to the Lord -
whether burnt offerings or sacrifices, for
special vows or freewill offerings or
festival offerings-
4then the one who brings his offering
shall present to the Lord a grain offering
of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed
with a quarter of a hin of oil.
5With each lamb for the burnt offering or
the sacrifice, prepare a quarter of a hin
of wine as a drink offering.
6" 'With a ram prepare a grain offering of
two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour
mixed with a third of a hin of oil,
7and a third of a hin of wine as a drink
offering. Offer it as an aroma pleasing to
the Lord .
8" 'When you prepare a young bull as a
burnt offering or sacrifice, for a special
vow or a fellowship offering to the Lord ,
9bring with the bull a grain offering of
three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour
mixed with half a hin of oil.
10Also bring half a hin of wine as a drink
offering. It will be an offering made by
fire, an aroma pleasing to the Lord .
11Each bull or ram, each lamb or young
goat, is to be prepared in this manner.
12Do this for each one, for as many as
you prepare.
13" 'Everyone who is native-born must do
these things in this way when he brings
an offering made by fire as an aroma
pleasing to the Lord .
14For the generations to come,
whenever an alien or anyone else living
among you presents an offering made
by fire as an aroma pleasing to the Lord ,
he must do exactly as you do.
15The community is to have the same
rules for you and for the alien living
among you; this is a lasting ordinance
for the generations to come. You and
the alien shall be the same before the
Lord :
16The same laws and regulations will
apply both to you and to the alien living
among you.' "
17The Lord said to Moses,
18"Speak to the Israelites and say to
them: 'When you enter the land to which
I am taking you
19and you eat the food of the land,
present a portion as an offering to the
Lord .
20Present a cake from the first of your
ground meal and present it as an
offering from the threshing floor.
21Throughout the generations to come
you are to give this offering to the Lord
from the first of your ground meal.
22" 'Now if you unintentionally fail to
keep any of these commands the Lord
gave Moses-
23any of the Lord 's commands to you
through him, from the day the Lord gave
them and continuing through the
generations to come-
24and if this is done unintentionally
without the community being aware of it,
then the whole community is to offer a
young bull for a burnt offering as an
aroma pleasing to the Lord , along with
its prescribed grain offering and drink
offering, and a male goat for a sin
offering.
25The priest is to make atonement for
the whole Israelite community, and they
will be forgiven, for it was not intentional
and they have brought to the Lord for
their wrong an offering made by fire and
a sin offering.
26The whole Israelite community and the
aliens living among them will be forgiven,
because all the people were involved in
the unintentional wrong.
27" 'But if just one person sins
unintentionally, he must bring a year-old
female goat for a sin offering.
28The priest is to make atonement
before the Lord for the one who erred by
sinning unintentionally, and when
atonement has been made for him, he
will be forgiven.
29One and the same law applies to
everyone who sins unintentionally,
whether he is a native-born Israelite or
an alien.
30" 'But anyone who sins defiantly,
whether native-born or alien,
blasphemes the Lord , and that person
must be cut off from his people.
31Because he has despised the Lord 's
word and broken his commands, that
person must surely be cut off; his guilt
remains on him.' "
32While the Israelites were in the desert,
a man was found gathering wood on the
Sabbath day.
33Those who found him gathering wood
brought him to Moses and Aaron and
the whole assembly,
34and they kept him in custody, because
it was not clear what should be done to
him.
35Then the Lord said to Moses, "The
man must die. The whole assembly
must stone him outside the camp."
36So the assembly took him outside the
camp and stoned him to death, as the
Lord commanded Moses.
37The Lord said to Moses,
38"Speak to the Israelites and say to
them: 'Throughout the generations to
come you are to make tassels on the
corners of your garments, with a blue
cord on each tassel.
39You will have these tassels to look at
and so you will remember all the
commands of the Lord , that you may
obey them and not prostitute yourselves
by going after the lusts of your own
hearts and eyes.
40Then you will remember to obey all my
commands and will be consecrated to
your God.
41I am the Lord your God, who brought
you out of Egypt to be your God. I am
the Lord your God.' "
16Korah son of Izhar, the son of
Kohath, the son of Levi, and certain
Reubenites-Dathan and Abiram, sons of
Eliab, and On son of Peleth-became
insolent
2and rose up against Moses. With them
were 250 Israelite men, well-known
community leaders who had been
appointed members of the council.
3They came as a group to oppose
Moses and Aaron and said to them,
"You have gone too far! The whole
community is holy, every one of them,
and the Lord is with them. Why then do
you set yourselves above the Lord 's
assembly?"
4When Moses heard this, he fell
facedown.
5Then he said to Korah and all his
followers: "In the morning the Lord will
show who belongs to him and who is
holy, and he will have that person come
near him. The man he chooses he will
cause to come near him.
6You, Korah, and all your followers are
to do this: Take censers
7and tomorrow put fire and incense in
them before the Lord . The man the
Lord chooses will be the one who is holy.
You Levites have gone too far!"
8Moses also said to Korah, "Now listen,
you Levites!
9Isn't it enough for you that the God of
Israel has separated you from the rest of
the Israelite community and brought you
near himself to do the work at the Lord
's tabernacle and to stand before the
community and minister to them?
10He has brought you and all your fellow
Levites near himself, but now you are
trying to get the priesthood too.
11It is against the Lord that you and all
your followers have banded together.
Who is Aaron that you should grumble
against him?"
12Then Moses summoned Dathan and
Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said,
"We will not come!
13Isn't it enough that you have brought
us up out of a land flowing with milk and
honey to kill us in the desert? And now
you also want to lord it over us?
14Moreover, you haven't brought us into
a land flowing with milk and honey or
given us an inheritance of fields and
vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes
of these men? No, we will not come!"
15Then Moses became very angry and
said to the Lord , "Do not accept their
offering. I have not taken so much as a
donkey from them, nor have I wronged
any of them."
16Moses said to Korah, "You and all your
followers are to appear before the Lord
tomorrow-you and they and Aaron.
17Each man is to take his censer and put
incense in it-250 censers in all-and
present it before the Lord . You and
Aaron are to present your censers also."
18So each man took his censer, put fire
and incense in it, and stood with Moses
and Aaron at the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting.
19When Korah had gathered all his
followers in opposition to them at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the
glory of the Lord appeared to the entire
assembly.
20The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
21"Separate yourselves from this
assembly so I can put an end to them at
once."
22But Moses and Aaron fell facedown
and cried out, "O God, God of the spirits
of all mankind, will you be angry with the
entire assembly when only one man
sins?"
23Then the Lord said to Moses,
24"Say to the assembly, 'Move away
from the tents of Korah, Dathan and
Abiram.' "
25Moses got up and went to Dathan and
Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed
him.
26He warned the assembly, "Move back
from the tents of these wicked men! Do
not touch anything belonging to them, or
you will be swept away because of all
their sins."
27So they moved away from the tents of
Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and
Abiram had come out and were standing
with their wives, children and little ones
at the entrances to their tents.
28Then Moses said, "This is how you will
know that the Lord has sent me to do all
these things and that it was not my idea:
29If these men die a natural death and
experience only what usually happens
to men, then the Lord has not sent me.
30But if the Lord brings about something
totally new, and the earth opens its
mouth and swallows them, with
everything that belongs to them, and
they go down alive into the grave, then
you will know that these men have
treated the Lord with contempt."
31As soon as he finished saying all this,
the ground under them split apart
32and the earth opened its mouth and
swallowed them, with their households
and all Korah's men and all their
possessions.
33They went down alive into the grave,
with everything they owned; the earth
closed over them, and they perished
and were gone from the community.
34At their cries, all the Israelites around
them fled, shouting, "The earth is going
to swallow us too!"
35And fire came out from the Lord and
consumed the 250 men who were
offering the incense.
36The Lord said to Moses,
37"Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest,
to take the censers out of the
smoldering remains and scatter the
coals some distance away, for the
censers are holy-
38the censers of the men who sinned at
the cost of their lives. Hammer the
censers into sheets to overlay the altar,
for they were presented before the Lord
and have become holy. Let them be a
sign to the Israelites."
39So Eleazar the priest collected the
bronze censers brought by those who
had been burned up, and he had them
hammered out to overlay the altar,
40as the Lord directed him through
Moses. This was to remind the Israelites
that no one except a descendant of
Aaron should come to burn incense
before the Lord , or he would become
like Korah and his followers.
41The next day the whole Israelite
community grumbled against Moses and
Aaron. "You have killed the Lord 's
people," they said.
42But when the assembly gathered in
opposition to Moses and Aaron and
turned toward the Tent of Meeting,
suddenly the cloud covered it and the
glory of the Lord appeared.
43Then Moses and Aaron went to the
front of the Tent of Meeting,
44and the Lord said to Moses,
45"Get away from this assembly so I can
put an end to them at once." And they
fell facedown.
46Then Moses said to Aaron, "Take your
censer and put incense in it, along with
fire from the altar, and hurry to the
assembly to make atonement for them.
Wrath has come out from the Lord ; the
plague has started."
47So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran
into the midst of the assembly. The
plague had already started among the
people, but Aaron offered the incense
and made atonement for them.
48He stood between the living and the
dead, and the plague stopped.
49But 14,700 people died from the
plague, in addition to those who had
died because of Korah.
50Then Aaron returned to Moses at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting, for the
plague had stopped.
17The Lord said to Moses,
2"Speak to the Israelites and get twelve
staffs from them, one from the leader of
each of their ancestral tribes. Write the
name of each man on his staff.
3On the staff of Levi write Aaron's name,
for there must be one staff for the head
of each ancestral tribe.
4Place them in the Tent of Meeting in
front of the Testimony, where I meet
with you.
5The staff belonging to the man I choose
will sprout, and I will rid myself of this
constant grumbling against you by the
Israelites."
6So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and
their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one
for the leader of each of their ancestral
tribes, and Aaron's staff was among
them.
7Moses placed the staffs before the Lord
in the Tent of the Testimony.
8The next day Moses entered the Tent
of the Testimony and saw that Aaron's
staff, which represented the house of
Levi, had not only sprouted but had
budded, blossomed and produced
almonds.
9Then Moses brought out all the staffs
from the Lord 's presence to all the
Israelites. They looked at them, and
each man took his own staff.
10The Lord said to Moses, "Put back
Aaron's staff in front of the Testimony, to
be kept as a sign to the rebellious. This
will put an end to their grumbling against
me, so that they will not die."
11Moses did just as the Lord
commanded him.
12The Israelites said to Moses, "We will
die! We are lost, we are all lost!
13Anyone who even comes near the
tabernacle of the Lord will die. Are we all
going to die?"
18The Lord said to Aaron, "You,
your sons and your father's family are to
bear the responsibility for offenses
against the sanctuary, and you and your
sons alone are to bear the responsibility
for offenses against the priesthood.
2Bring your fellow Levites from your
ancestral tribe to join you and assist you
when you and your sons minister before
the Tent of the Testimony.
3They are to be responsible to you and
are to perform all the duties of the Tent,
but they must not go near the
furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar,
or both they and you will die.
4They are to join you and be responsible
for the care of the Tent of Meeting-all
the work at the Tent-and no one else
may come near where you are.
5"You are to be responsible for the care
of the sanctuary and the altar, so that
wrath will not fall on the Israelites again.
6I myself have selected your fellow
Levites from among the Israelites as a
gift to you, dedicated to the Lord to do
the work at the Tent of Meeting.
7But only you and your sons may serve
as priests in connection with everything
at the altar and inside the curtain. I am
giving you the service of the priesthood
as a gift. Anyone else who comes near
the sanctuary must be put to death."
8Then the Lord said to Aaron, "I myself
have put you in charge of the offerings
presented to me; all the holy offerings
the Israelites give me I give to you and
your sons as your portion and regular
share.
9You are to have the part of the most
holy offerings that is kept from the fire.
From all the gifts they bring me as most
holy offerings, whether grain or sin or
guilt offerings, that part belongs to you
and your sons.
10Eat it as something most holy; every
male shall eat it. You must regard it as
holy.
11"This also is yours: whatever is set
aside from the gifts of all the wave
offerings of the Israelites. I give this to
you and your sons and daughters as
your regular share. Everyone in your
household who is ceremonially clean
may eat it.
12"I give you all the finest olive oil and all
the finest new wine and grain they give
the Lord as the firstfruits of their harvest.
13All the land's firstfruits that they bring
to the Lord will be yours. Everyone in
your household who is ceremonially
clean may eat it.
14"Everything in Israel that is devoted to
the Lord is yours.
15The first offspring of every womb, both
man and animal, that is offered to the
Lord is yours. But you must redeem
every firstborn son and every firstborn
male of unclean animals.
16When they are a month old, you must
redeem them at the redemption price
set at five shekels of silver, according to
the sanctuary shekel, which weighs
twenty gerahs.
17"But you must not redeem the firstborn
of an ox, a sheep or a goat; they are
holy. Sprinkle their blood on the altar
and burn their fat as an offering made
by fire, an aroma pleasing to the Lord .
18Their meat is to be yours, just as the
breast of the wave offering and the right
thigh are yours.
19Whatever is set aside from the holy
offerings the Israelites present to the
Lord I give to you and your sons and
daughters as your regular share. It is an
everlasting covenant of salt before the
Lord for both you and your offspring."
20The Lord said to Aaron, "You will have
no inheritance in their land, nor will you
have any share among them; I am your
share and your inheritance among the
Israelites.
21"I give to the Levites all the tithes in
Israel as their inheritance in return for
the work they do while serving at the
Tent of Meeting.
22From now on the Israelites must not
go near the Tent of Meeting, or they will
bear the consequences of their sin and
will die.
23It is the Levites who are to do the work
at the Tent of Meeting and bear the
responsibility for offenses against it.
This is a lasting ordinance for the
generations to come. They will receive
no inheritance among the Israelites.
24Instead, I give to the Levites as their
inheritance the tithes that the Israelites
present as an offering to the Lord . That
is why I said concerning them: 'They will
have no inheritance among the
Israelites.' "
25The Lord said to Moses,
26"Speak to the Levites and say to them:
'When you receive from the Israelites
the tithe I give you as your inheritance,
you must present a tenth of that tithe as
the Lord 's offering.
27Your offering will be reckoned to you
as grain from the threshing floor or juice
from the winepress.
28In this way you also will present an
offering to the Lord from all the tithes
you receive from the Israelites. From
these tithes you must give the Lord 's
portion to Aaron the priest.
29You must present as the Lord 's
portion the best and holiest part of
everything given to you.'
30"Say to the Levites: 'When you present
the best part, it will be reckoned to you
as the product of the threshing floor or
the winepress.
31You and your households may eat the
rest of it anywhere, for it is your wages
for your work at the Tent of Meeting.
32By presenting the best part of it you
will not be guilty in this matter; then you
will not defile the holy offerings of the
Israelites, and you will not die.' "
19The Lord said to Moses and
Aaron:
2"This is a requirement of the law that
the Lord has commanded: Tell the
Israelites to bring you a red heifer
without defect or blemish and that has
never been under a yoke.
3Give it to Eleazar the priest; it is to be
taken outside the camp and slaughtered
in his presence.
4Then Eleazar the priest is to take some
of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it
seven times toward the front of the Tent
of Meeting.
5While he watches, the heifer is to be
burned-its hide, flesh, blood and offal.
6The priest is to take some cedar wood,
hyssop and scarlet wool and throw them
onto the burning heifer.
7After that, the priest must wash his
clothes and bathe himself with water. He
may then come into the camp, but he
will be ceremonially unclean till evening.
8The man who burns it must also wash
his clothes and bathe with water, and he
too will be unclean till evening.
9"A man who is clean shall gather up the
ashes of the heifer and put them in a
ceremonially clean place outside the
camp. They shall be kept by the Israelite
community for use in the water of
cleansing; it is for purification from sin.
10The man who gathers up the ashes of
the heifer must also wash his clothes,
and he too will be unclean till evening.
This will be a lasting ordinance both for
the Israelites and for the aliens living
among them.
11"Whoever touches the dead body of
anyone will be unclean for seven days.
12He must purify himself with the water
on the third day and on the seventh day;
then he will be clean. But if he does not
purify himself on the third and seventh
days, he will not be clean.
13Whoever touches the dead body of
anyone and fails to purify himself defiles
the Lord 's tabernacle. That person must
be cut off from Israel. Because the water
of cleansing has not been sprinkled on
him, he is unclean; his uncleanness
remains on him.
14"This is the law that applies when a
person dies in a tent: Anyone who
enters the tent and anyone who is in it
will be unclean for seven days,
15and every open container without a lid
fastened on it will be unclean.
16"Anyone out in the open who touches
someone who has been killed with a
sword or someone who has died a
natural death, or anyone who touches a
human bone or a grave, will be unclean
for seven days.
17"For the unclean person, put some
ashes from the burned purification
offering into a jar and pour fresh water
over them.
18Then a man who is ceremonially clean
is to take some hyssop, dip it in the
water and sprinkle the tent and all the
furnishings and the people who were
there. He must also sprinkle anyone
who has touched a human bone or a
grave or someone who has been killed
or someone who has died a natural
death.
19The man who is clean is to sprinkle the
unclean person on the third and seventh
days, and on the seventh day he is to
purify him. The person being cleansed
must wash his clothes and bathe with
water, and that evening he will be clean.
20But if a person who is unclean does
not purify himself, he must be cut off
from the community, because he has
defiled the sanctuary of the Lord . The
water of cleansing has not been
sprinkled on him, and he is unclean.
21This is a lasting ordinance for them.
"The man who sprinkles the water of
cleansing must also wash his clothes,
and anyone who touches the water of
cleansing will be unclean till evening.
22Anything that an unclean person
touches becomes unclean, and anyone
who touches it becomes unclean till
evening."
20In the first month the whole
Israelite community arrived at the Desert
of Zin, and they stayed at Kadesh.
There Miriam died and was buried.
2Now there was no water for the
community, and the people gathered in
opposition to Moses and Aaron.
3They quarreled with Moses and said, "If
only we had died when our brothers fell
dead before the Lord !
4Why did you bring the Lord 's
community into this desert, that we and
our livestock should die here?
5Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to
this terrible place? It has no grain or figs,
grapevines or pomegranates. And there
is no water to drink!"
6Moses and Aaron went from the
assembly to the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting and fell facedown, and the glory
of the Lord appeared to them.
7The Lord said to Moses,
8"Take the staff, and you and your
brother Aaron gather the assembly
together. Speak to that rock before their
eyes and it will pour out its water. You
will bring water out of the rock for the
community so they and their livestock
can drink."
9So Moses took the staff from the Lord
's presence, just as he commanded him.
10He and Aaron gathered the assembly
together in front of the rock and Moses
said to them, "Listen, you rebels, must
we bring you water out of this rock?"
11Then Moses raised his arm and struck
the rock twice with his staff. Water
gushed out, and the community and
their livestock drank.
12But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
"Because you did not trust in me enough
to honor me as holy in the sight of the
Israelites, you will not bring this
community into the land I give them."
13These were the waters of Meribah,
where the Israelites quarreled with the
Lord and where he showed himself holy
among them.
14Moses sent messengers from Kadesh
to the king of Edom, saying: "This is
what your brother Israel says: You know
about all the hardships that have come
upon us.
15Our forefathers went down into Egypt,
and we lived there many years. The
Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers,
16but when we cried out to the Lord , he
heard our cry and sent an angel and
brought us out of Egypt. "Now we are
here at Kadesh, a town on the edge of
your territory.
17Please let us pass through your
country. We will not go through any field
or vineyard, or drink water from any well.
We will travel along the king's highway
and not turn to the right or to the left
until we have passed through your
territory."
18But Edom answered: "You may not
pass through here; if you try, we will
march out and attack you with the
sword."
19The Israelites replied: "We will go
along the main road, and if we or our
livestock drink any of your water, we will
pay for it. We only want to pass through
on foot-nothing else."
20Again they answered: "You may not
pass through." Then Edom came out
against them with a large and powerful
army.
21Since Edom refused to let them go
through their territory, Israel turned
away from them.
22The whole Israelite community set out
from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.
23At Mount Hor, near the border of
Edom, the Lord said to Moses and
Aaron,
24"Aaron will be gathered to his people.
He will not enter the land I give the
Israelites, because both of you rebelled
against my command at the waters of
Meribah.
25Get Aaron and his son Eleazar and
take them up Mount Hor.
26Remove Aaron's garments and put
them on his son Eleazar, for Aaron will
be gathered to his people; he will die
there."
27Moses did as the Lord commanded:
They went up Mount Hor in the sight of
the whole community.
28Moses removed Aaron's garments and
put them on his son Eleazar. And Aaron
died there on top of the mountain. Then
Moses and Eleazar came down from the
mountain,
29and when the whole community
learned that Aaron had died, the entire
house of Israel mourned for him thirty
days.
21When the Canaanite king of Arad,
who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel
was coming along the road to Atharim,
he attacked the Israelites and captured
some of them.
2Then Israel made this vow to the Lord :
"If you will deliver these people into our
hands, we will totally destroy their
cities."
3The Lord listened to Israel's plea and
gave the Canaanites over to them. They
completely destroyed them and their
towns; so the place was named Hormah.
4They traveled from Mount Hor along
the route to the Red Sea, to go around
Edom. But the people grew impatient on
the way;
5they spoke against God and against
Moses, and said, "Why have you
brought us up out of Egypt to die in the
desert? There is no bread! There is no
water! And we detest this miserable
food!"
6Then the Lord sent venomous snakes
among them; they bit the people and
many Israelites died.
7The people came to Moses and said,
"We sinned when we spoke against the
Lord and against you. Pray that the Lord
will take the snakes away from us." So
Moses prayed for the people.
8The Lord said to Moses, "Make a snake
and put it up on a pole; anyone who is
bitten can look at it and live."
9So Moses made a bronze snake and
put it up on a pole. Then when anyone
was bitten by a snake and looked at the
bronze snake, he lived.
10The Israelites moved on and camped
at Oboth.
11Then they set out from Oboth and
camped in Iye Abarim, in the desert that
faces Moab toward the sunrise.
12From there they moved on and
camped in the Zered Valley.
13They set out from there and camped
alongside the Arnon, which is in the
desert extending into Amorite territory.
The Arnon is the border of Moab,
between Moab and the Amorites.
14That is why the Book of the Wars of
the Lord says: "?Waheb in Suphah and
the ravines, the Arnon
15and the slopes of the ravines that lead
to the site of Ar and lie along the border
of Moab."
16From there they continued on to Beer,
the well where the Lord said to Moses,
"Gather the people together and I will
give them water."
17Then Israel sang this song: "Spring up,
O well! Sing about it,
18about the well that the princes dug,
that the nobles of the people sank- the
nobles with scepters and staffs." Then
they went from the desert to Mattanah,
19from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from
Nahaliel to Bamoth,
20and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab
where the top of Pisgah overlooks the
wasteland.
21Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon
king of the Amorites:
22"Let us pass through your country. We
will not turn aside into any field or
vineyard, or drink water from any well.
We will travel along the king's highway
until we have passed through your
territory."
23But Sihon would not let Israel pass
through his territory. He mustered his
entire army and marched out into the
desert against Israel. When he reached
Jahaz, he fought with Israel.
24Israel, however, put him to the sword
and took over his land from the Arnon to
the Jabbok, but only as far as the
Ammonites, because their border was
fortified.
25Israel captured all the cities of the
Amorites and occupied them, including
Heshbon and all its surrounding
settlements.
26Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of
the Amorites, who had fought against
the former king of Moab and had taken
from him all his land as far as the Arnon.
27That is why the poets say: "Come to
Heshbon and let it be rebuilt; let Sihon's
city be restored.
28"Fire went out from Heshbon, a blaze
from the city of Sihon. It consumed Ar of
Moab, the citizens of Arnon's heights.
29Woe to you, O Moab! You are
destroyed, O people of Chemosh! He
has given up his sons as fugitives and
his daughters as captives to Sihon king
of the Amorites.
30"But we have overthrown them;
Heshbon is destroyed all the way to
Dibon. We have demolished them as far
as Nophah, which extends to Medeba."
31So Israel settled in the land of the
Amorites.
32After Moses had sent spies to Jazer,
the Israelites captured its surrounding
settlements and drove out the Amorites
who were there.
33Then they turned and went up along
the road toward Bashan, and Og king of
Bashan and his whole army marched
out to meet them in battle at Edrei.
34The Lord said to Moses, "Do not be
afraid of him, for I have handed him over
to you, with his whole army and his land.
Do to him what you did to Sihon king of
the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon."
35So they struck him down, together with
his sons and his whole army, leaving
them no survivors. And they took
possession of his land.
22Then the Israelites traveled to the
plains of Moab and camped along the
Jordan across from Jericho.
2Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that
Israel had done to the Amorites,
3and Moab was terrified because there
were so many people. Indeed, Moab
was filled with dread because of the
Israelites.
4The Moabites said to the elders of
Midian, "This horde is going to lick up
everything around us, as an ox licks up
the grass of the field." So Balak son of
Zippor, who was king of Moab at that
time,
5sent messengers to summon Balaam
son of Beor, who was at Pethor, near
the River, in his native land. Balak said:
"A people has come out of Egypt; they
cover the face of the land and have
settled next to me.
6Now come and put a curse on these
people, because they are too powerful
for me. Perhaps then I will be able to
defeat them and drive them out of the
country. For I know that those you bless
are blessed, and those you curse are
cursed."
7The elders of Moab and Midian left,
taking with them the fee for divination.
When they came to Balaam, they told
him what Balak had said.
8"Spend the night here," Balaam said to
them, "and I will bring you back the
answer the Lord gives me." So the
Moabite princes stayed with him.
9God came to Balaam and asked, "Who
are these men with you?"
10Balaam said to God, "Balak son of
Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this
message:
11'A people that has come out of Egypt
covers the face of the land. Now come
and put a curse on them for me.
Perhaps then I will be able to fight them
and drive them away.' "
12But God said to Balaam, "Do not go
with them. You must not put a curse on
those people, because they are
blessed."
13The next morning Balaam got up and
said to Balak's princes, "Go back to your
own country, for the Lord has refused to
let me go with you."
14So the Moabite princes returned to
Balak and said, "Balaam refused to
come with us."
15Then Balak sent other princes, more
numerous and more distinguished than
the first.
16They came to Balaam and said: "This
is what Balak son of Zippor says: Do not
let anything keep you from coming to
me,
17because I will reward you handsomely
and do whatever you say. Come and put
a curse on these people for me."
18But Balaam answered them, "Even if
Balak gave me his palace filled with
silver and gold, I could not do anything
great or small to go beyond the
command of the Lord my God.
19Now stay here tonight as the others
did, and I will find out what else the Lord
will tell me."
20That night God came to Balaam and
said, "Since these men have come to
summon you, go with them, but do only
what I tell you."
21Balaam got up in the morning, saddled
his donkey and went with the princes of
Moab.
22But God was very angry when he went,
and the angel of the Lord stood in the
road to oppose him. Balaam was riding
on his donkey, and his two servants
were with him.
23When the donkey saw the angel of the
Lord standing in the road with a drawn
sword in his hand, she turned off the
road into a field. Balaam beat her to get
her back on the road.
24Then the angel of the Lord stood in a
narrow path between two vineyards,
with walls on both sides.
25When the donkey saw the angel of the
Lord , she pressed close to the wall,
crushing Balaam's foot against it. So he
beat her again.
26Then the angel of the Lord moved on
ahead and stood in a narrow place
where there was no room to turn, either
to the right or to the left.
27When the donkey saw the angel of the
Lord , she lay down under Balaam, and
he was angry and beat her with his staff.
28Then the Lord opened the donkey's
mouth, and she said to Balaam, "What
have I done to you to make you beat me
these three times?"
29Balaam answered the donkey, "You
have made a fool of me! If I had a sword
in my hand, I would kill you right now."
30The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not
your own donkey, which you have
always ridden, to this day? Have I been
in the habit of doing this to you?" "No,"
he said.
31Then the Lord opened Balaam's eyes,
and he saw the angel of the Lord
standing in the road with his sword
drawn. So he bowed low and fell
facedown.
32The angel of the Lord asked him, "Why
have you beaten your donkey these
three times? I have come here to
oppose you because your path is a
reckless one before me.
33The donkey saw me and turned away
from me these three times. If she had
not turned away, I would certainly have
killed you by now, but I would have
spared her."
34Balaam said to the angel of the Lord ,
"I have sinned. I did not realize you were
standing in the road to oppose me. Now
if you are displeased, I will go back."
35The angel of the Lord said to Balaam,
"Go with the men, but speak only what I
tell you." So Balaam went with the
princes of Balak.
36When Balak heard that Balaam was
coming, he went out to meet him at the
Moabite town on the Arnon border, at
the edge of his territory.
37Balak said to Balaam, "Did I not send
you an urgent summons? Why didn't
you come to me? Am I really not able to
reward you?"
38"Well, I have come to you now,"
Balaam replied. "But can I say just
anything? I must speak only what God
puts in my mouth."
39Then Balaam went with Balak to
Kiriath Huzoth.
40Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and
gave some to Balaam and the princes
who were with him.
41The next morning Balak took Balaam
up to Bamoth Baal, and from there he
saw part of the people.
23Balaam said, "Build me seven
altars here, and prepare seven bulls and
seven rams for me."
2Balak did as Balaam said, and the two
of them offered a bull and a ram on
each altar.
3Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here
beside your offering while I go aside.
Perhaps the Lord will come to meet with
me. Whatever he reveals to me I will tell
you." Then he went off to a barren
height.
4God met with him, and Balaam said, "I
have prepared seven altars, and on
each altar I have offered a bull and a
ram."
5The Lord put a message in Balaam's
mouth and said, "Go back to Balak and
give him this message."
6So he went back to him and found him
standing beside his offering, with all the
princes of Moab.
7Then Balaam uttered his oracle: "Balak
brought me from Aram, the king of Moab
from the eastern mountains. 'Come,' he
said, 'curse Jacob for me; come,
denounce Israel.'
8How can I curse those whom God has
not cursed? How can I denounce those
whom the Lord has not denounced?
9From the rocky peaks I see them, from
the heights I view them. I see a people
who live apart and do not consider
themselves one of the nations.
10Who can count the dust of Jacob or
number the fourth part of Israel? Let me
die the death of the righteous, and may
my end be like theirs!"
11Balak said to Balaam, "What have you
done to me? I brought you to curse my
enemies, but you have done nothing but
bless them!"
12He answered, "Must I not speak what
the Lord puts in my mouth?"
13Then Balak said to him, "Come with
me to another place where you can see
them; you will see only a part but not all
of them. And from there, curse them for
me."
14So he took him to the field of Zophim
on the top of Pisgah, and there he built
seven altars and offered a bull and a
ram on each altar.
15Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here
beside your offering while I meet with
him over there."
16The Lord met with Balaam and put a
message in his mouth and said, "Go
back to Balak and give him this
message."
17So he went to him and found him
standing beside his offering, with the
princes of Moab. Balak asked him,
"What did the Lord say?"
18Then he uttered his oracle: "Arise,
Balak, and listen; hear me, son of Zippor.
19God is not a man, that he should lie,
nor a son of man, that he should change
his mind. Does he speak and then not
act? Does he promise and not fulfill?
20I have received a command to bless;
he has blessed, and I cannot change it.
21"No misfortune is seen in Jacob, no
misery observed in Israel. The Lord their
God is with them; the shout of the King
is among them.
22God brought them out of Egypt; they
have the strength of a wild ox.
23There is no sorcery against Jacob, no
divination against Israel. It will now be
said of Jacob and of Israel, 'See what
God has done!'
24The people rise like a lioness; they
rouse themselves like a lion that does
not rest till he devours his prey and
drinks the blood of his victims."
25Then Balak said to Balaam, "Neither
curse them at all nor bless them at all!"
26Balaam answered, "Did I not tell you I
must do whatever the Lord says?"
27Then Balak said to Balaam, "Come, let
me take you to another place. Perhaps it
will please God to let you curse them for
me from there."
28And Balak took Balaam to the top of
Peor, overlooking the wasteland.
29Balaam said, "Build me seven altars
here, and prepare seven bulls and
seven rams for me."
30Balak did as Balaam had said, and
offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
24Now when Balaam saw that it
pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he did
not resort to sorcery as at other times,
but turned his face toward the desert.
2When Balaam looked out and saw
Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit
of God came upon him
3and he uttered his oracle: "The oracle
of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of one
whose eye sees clearly,
4the oracle of one who hears the words
of God, who sees a vision from the
Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose
eyes are opened:
5"How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob,
your dwelling places, O Israel!
6"Like valleys they spread out, like
gardens beside a river, like aloes
planted by the Lord , like cedars beside
the waters.
7Water will flow from their buckets; their
seed will have abundant water. "Their
king will be greater than Agag; their
kingdom will be exalted.
8"God brought them out of Egypt; they
have the strength of a wild ox. They
devour hostile nations and break their
bones in pieces; with their arrows they
pierce them.
9Like a lion they crouch and lie down,
like a lioness-who dares to rouse them?
"May those who bless you be blessed
and those who curse you be cursed!"
10Then Balak's anger burned against
Balaam. He struck his hands together
and said to him, "I summoned you to
curse my enemies, but you have
blessed them these three times.
11Now leave at once and go home! I
said I would reward you handsomely,
but the Lord has kept you from being
rewarded."
12Balaam answered Balak, "Did I not tell
the messengers you sent me,
13'Even if Balak gave me his palace filled
with silver and gold, I could not do
anything of my own accord, good or bad,
to go beyond the command of the Lord -
and I must say only what the Lord
says'?
14Now I am going back to my people,
but come, let me warn you of what this
people will do to your people in days to
come."
15Then he uttered his oracle: "The oracle
of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of one
whose eye sees clearly,
16the oracle of one who hears the words
of God, who has knowledge from the
Most High, who sees a vision from the
Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose
eyes are opened:
17"I see him, but not now; I behold him,
but not near. A star will come out of
Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel.
He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the
skulls of all the sons of Sheth.
18Edom will be conquered; Seir, his
enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will
grow strong.
19A ruler will come out of Jacob and
destroy the survivors of the city."
20Then Balaam saw Amalek and uttered
his oracle: "Amalek was first among the
nations, but he will come to ruin at last."
21Then he saw the Kenites and uttered
his oracle: "Your dwelling place is
secure, your nest is set in a rock;
22yet you Kenites will be destroyed when
Asshur takes you captive."
23Then he uttered his oracle: "Ah, who
can live when God does this?
24Ships will come from the shores of
Kittim; they will subdue Asshur and Eber,
but they too will come to ruin."
25Then Balaam got up and returned
home and Balak went his own way.
25While Israel was staying in Shittim,
the men began to indulge in sexual
immorality with Moabite women,
2who invited them to the sacrifices to
their gods. The people ate and bowed
down before these gods.
3So Israel joined in worshiping the Baal
of Peor. And the Lord 's anger burned
against them.
4The Lord said to Moses, "Take all the
leaders of these people, kill them and
expose them in broad daylight before
the Lord , so that the Lord 's fierce anger
may turn away from Israel."
5So Moses said to Israel's judges, "Each
of you must put to death those of your
men who have joined in worshiping the
Baal of Peor."
6Then an Israelite man brought to his
family a Midianite woman right before
the eyes of Moses and the whole
assembly of Israel while they were
weeping at the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting.
7When Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son
of Aaron, the priest, saw this, he left the
assembly, took a spear in his hand
8and followed the Israelite into the tent.
He drove the spear through both of
them-through the Israelite and into the
woman's body. Then the plague against
the Israelites was stopped;
9but those who died in the plague
numbered 24,000.
10The Lord said to Moses,
11"Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of
Aaron, the priest, has turned my anger
away from the Israelites; for he was as
zealous as I am for my honor among
them, so that in my zeal I did not put an
end to them.
12Therefore tell him I am making my
covenant of peace with him.
13He and his descendants will have a
covenant of a lasting priesthood,
because he was zealous for the honor
of his God and made atonement for the
Israelites."
14The name of the Israelite who was
killed with the Midianite woman was
Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a
Simeonite family.
15And the name of the Midianite woman
who was put to death was Cozbi
daughter of Zur, a tribal chief of a
Midianite family.
16The Lord said to Moses,
17"Treat the Midianites as enemies and
kill them,
18because they treated you as enemies
when they deceived you in the affair of
Peor and their sister Cozbi, the daughter
of a Midianite leader, the woman who
was killed when the plague came as a
result of Peor."
26After the plague the Lord said to
Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron, the
priest,
2"Take a census of the whole Israelite
community by families-all those twenty
years old or more who are able to serve
in the army of Israel."
3So on the plains of Moab by the Jordan
across from Jericho, Moses and Eleazar
the priest spoke with them and said,
4"Take a census of the men twenty
years old or more, as the Lord
commanded Moses." These were the
Israelites who came out of Egypt:
5The descendants of Reuben, the
firstborn son of Israel, were: through
Hanoch, the Hanochite clan; through
Pallu, the Palluite clan;
6through Hezron, the Hezronite clan;
through Carmi, the Carmite clan.
7These were the clans of Reuben; those
numbered were 43,730.
8The son of Pallu was Eliab,
9and the sons of Eliab were Nemuel,
Dathan and Abiram. The same Dathan
and Abiram were the community officials
who rebelled against Moses and Aaron
and were among Korah's followers when
they rebelled against the Lord .
10The earth opened its mouth and
swallowed them along with Korah,
whose followers died when the fire
devoured the 250 men. And they served
as a warning sign.
11The line of Korah, however, did not die
out.
12The descendants of Simeon by their
clans were: through Nemuel, the
Nemuelite clan; through Jamin, the
Jaminite clan; through Jakin, the
Jakinite clan;
13through Zerah, the Zerahite clan;
through Shaul, the Shaulite clan.
14These were the clans of Simeon; there
were 22,200 men.
15The descendants of Gad by their clans
were: through Zephon, the Zephonite
clan; through Haggi, the Haggite clan;
through Shuni, the Shunite clan;
16through Ozni, the Oznite clan; through
Eri, the Erite clan;
17through Arodi, the Arodite clan;
through Areli, the Arelite clan.
18These were the clans of Gad; those
numbered were 40,500.
19Er and Onan were sons of Judah, but
they died in Canaan.
20The descendants of Judah by their
clans were: through Shelah, the
Shelanite clan; through Perez, the
Perezite clan; through Zerah, the
Zerahite clan.
21The descendants of Perez were:
through Hezron, the Hezronite clan;
through Hamul, the Hamulite clan.
22These were the clans of Judah; those
numbered were 76,500.
23The descendants of Issachar by their
clans were: through Tola, the Tolaite
clan; through Puah, the Puite clan;

28The descendants of Joseph by their

29The descendants of Manasseh:

30These were the descendants of
Gilead: through Iezer, the Iezerite clan;
through Helek, the Helekite clan;
31through Asriel, the Asrielite clan;
through Shechem, the Shechemite clan;
32through Shemida, the Shemidaite clan;
through Hepher, the Hepherite clan.
33(Zelophehad son of Hepher had no
sons; he had only daughters, whose
names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah,
Milcah and Tirzah.)
34These were the clans of Manasseh;
those numbered were 52,700.
35These were the descendants of
Ephraim by their clans: through
Shuthelah, the Shuthelahite clan;
through Beker, the Bekerite clan;
through Tahan, the Tahanite clan.
36These were the descendants of
Shuthelah: through Eran, the Eranite
clan.
37These were the clans of Ephraim;
those numbered were 32,500. These
were the descendants of Joseph by their
clans.
38The descendants of Benjamin by their
clans were: through Bela, the Belaite
clan; through Ashbel, the Ashbelite clan;
through Ahiram, the Ahiramite clan;
39through Shupham, the Shuphamite

41These were the clans of Benjamin;

42These were the descendants of Dan

44The descendants of Asher by their

45and through the descendants of
Beriah: through Heber, the Heberite

46(Asher had a daughter named Serah.)
47These were the clans of Asher; those

48The descendants of Naphtali by their
clans were: through Jahzeel, the

49through Jezer, the Jezerite clan;
through Shillem, the Shillemite clan.
50These were the clans of Naphtali;

51The total number of the men of Israel
was 601,730.
52The Lord said to Moses,
53"The land is to be allotted to them as
an inheritance based on the number of
names.
54To a larger group give a larger
inheritance, and to a smaller group a
smaller one; each is to receive its
inheritance according to the number of
those listed.
55Be sure that the land is distributed by
lot. What each group inherits will be
according to the names for its ancestral
tribe.
56Each inheritance is to be distributed by
lot among the larger and smaller
groups."
57These were the Levites who were
counted by their clans: through Gershon,
the Gershonite clan; through Kohath,
the Kohathite clan; through Merari, the
Merarite clan.
58These also were Levite clans: the
Libnite clan, the Hebronite clan, the
Mahlite clan, the Mushite clan, the
Korahite clan. (Kohath was the
forefather of Amram;
59the name of Amram's wife was
Jochebed, a descendant of Levi, who
was born to the Levites in Egypt. To
Amram she bore Aaron, Moses and
their sister Miriam.
60Aaron was the father of Nadab and
Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
61But Nadab and Abihu died when they
made an offering before the Lord with
unauthorized fire.)
62All the male Levites a month old or
more numbered 23,000. They were not
counted along with the other Israelites
because they received no inheritance
among them.
63These are the ones counted by Moses
and Eleazar the priest when they
counted the Israelites on the plains of
Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
64Not one of them was among those
counted by Moses and Aaron the priest
when they counted the Israelites in the
Desert of Sinai.
65For the Lord had told those Israelites
they would surely die in the desert, and
not one of them was left except Caleb
son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of
Nun.
27The daughters of Zelophehad son
of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of
Makir, the son of Manasseh, belonged
to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph.
The names of the daughters were
Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and
Tirzah. They approached
2the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and
stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest,
the leaders and the whole assembly,
and said,
3"Our father died in the desert. He was
not among Korah's followers, who
banded together against the Lord , but
he died for his own sin and left no sons.
4Why should our father's name
disappear from his clan because he had
no son? Give us property among our
father's relatives."
5So Moses brought their case before the
Lord
6and the Lord said to him,
7"What Zelophehad's daughters are
saying is right. You must certainly give
them property as an inheritance among
their father's relatives and turn their
father's inheritance over to them.
8"Say to the Israelites, 'If a man dies and
leaves no son, turn his inheritance over
to his daughter.
9If he has no daughter, give his
inheritance to his brothers.
10If he has no brothers, give his
inheritance to his father's brothers.
11If his father had no brothers, give his
inheritance to the nearest relative in his
clan, that he may possess it. This is to
be a legal requirement for the Israelites,
as the Lord commanded Moses.' "
12Then the Lord said to Moses, "Go up
this mountain in the Abarim range and
see the land I have given the Israelites.
13After you have seen it, you too will be
gathered to your people, as your brother
Aaron was,
14for when the community rebelled at the
waters in the Desert of Zin, both of you
disobeyed my command to honor me as
holy before their eyes." (These were the
waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the Desert
of Zin.)
15Moses said to the Lord ,
16"May the Lord , the God of the spirits
of all mankind, appoint a man over this
community
17to go out and come in before them,
one who will lead them out and bring
them in, so the Lord 's people will not be
like sheep without a shepherd."
18So the Lord said to Moses, "Take
Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is
the spirit, and lay your hand on him.
19Have him stand before Eleazar the
priest and the entire assembly and
commission him in their presence.
20Give him some of your authority so the
whole Israelite community will obey him.
21He is to stand before Eleazar the
priest, who will obtain decisions for him
by inquiring of the Urim before the Lord .
At his command he and the entire
community of the Israelites will go out,
and at his command they will come in."
22Moses did as the Lord commanded
him. He took Joshua and had him stand
before Eleazar the priest and the whole
assembly.
23Then he laid his hands on him and
commissioned him, as the Lord
instructed through Moses.
28The Lord said to Moses,
2"Give this command to the Israelites
and say to them: 'See that you present
to me at the appointed time the food for
my offerings made by fire, as an aroma
pleasing to me.'
3Say to them: 'This is the offering made
by fire that you are to present to the
Lord : two lambs a year old without
defect, as a regular burnt offering each
day.
4Prepare one lamb in the morning and
the other at twilight,
5together with a grain offering of a tenth
of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a
quarter of a hin of oil from pressed
olives.
6This is the regular burnt offering
instituted at Mount Sinai as a pleasing
aroma, an offering made to the Lord by
fire.
7The accompanying drink offering is to
be a quarter of a hin of fermented drink
with each lamb. Pour out the drink
offering to the Lord at the sanctuary.
8Prepare the second lamb at twilight,
along with the same kind of grain
offering and drink offering that you
prepare in the morning. This is an
offering made by fire, an aroma pleasing
to the Lord .
9" 'On the Sabbath day, make an
offering of two lambs a year old without
defect, together with its drink offering
and a grain offering of two-tenths of an
ephah of fine flour mixed with oil.
10This is the burnt offering for every
Sabbath, in addition to the regular burnt
offering and its drink offering.
11" 'On the first of every month, present
to the Lord a burnt offering of two young
bulls, one ram and seven male lambs a
year old, all without defect.
12With each bull there is to be a grain
offering of three-tenths of an ephah of
fine flour mixed with oil; with the ram, a
grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah
of fine flour mixed with oil;
13and with each lamb, a grain offering of
a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed
with oil. This is for a burnt offering, a
pleasing aroma, an offering made to the
Lord by fire.
14With each bull there is to be a drink
offering of half a hin of wine; with the
ram, a third of a hin ; and with each
lamb, a quarter of a hin. This is the
monthly burnt offering to be made at
each new moon during the year.
15Besides the regular burnt offering with
its drink offering, one male goat is to be
presented to the Lord as a sin offering.
16" 'On the fourteenth day of the first
month the Lord 's Passover is to be held.
17On the fifteenth day of this month
there is to be a festival; for seven days
eat bread made without yeast.
18On the first day hold a sacred
assembly and do no regular work.
19Present to the Lord an offering made
by fire, a burnt offering of two young
bulls, one ram and seven male lambs a
year old, all without defect.
20With each bull prepare a grain offering
of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour
mixed with oil; with the ram, two-tenths;
21and with each of the seven lambs,
one-tenth.
22Include one male goat as a sin offering
to make atonement for you.
23Prepare these in addition to the
regular morning burnt offering.
24In this way prepare the food for the
offering made by fire every day for
seven days as an aroma pleasing to the
Lord ; it is to be prepared in addition to
the regular burnt offering and its drink
offering.
25On the seventh day hold a sacred
assembly and do no regular work.

work.
27Present a burnt offering of two young
bulls, one ram and seven male lambs a
year old as an aroma pleasing to the
Lord .

offering of three-tenths of an ephah of
fine flour mixed with oil; with the ram,
two-tenths;
29and with each of the seven lambs,
one-tenth.
30Include one male goat to make
atonement for you.
31Prepare these together with their drink
offerings, in addition to the regular burnt
offering and its grain offering. Be sure
the animals are without defect.
29" 'On the first day of the seventh
month hold a sacred assembly and do
no regular work. It is a day for you to
sound the trumpets.
2As an aroma pleasing to the Lord ,

bull, one ram and seven male lambs a
year old, all without defect.

to make atonement for you.
6These are in addition to the monthly
and daily burnt offerings with their grain

They are offerings made to the Lord by
fire-a pleasing aroma.
7" 'On the tenth day of this seventh

Lord a burnt offering of one young bull,

39" 'In addition to what you vow and your
freewill offerings, prepare these for the
Lord at your appointed feasts: your
burnt offerings, grain offerings, drink
offerings and fellowship offerings. ' "
40Moses told the Israelites all that the
Lord commanded him.
30Moses said to the heads of the
tribes of Israel: "This is what the Lord
commands:
2When a man makes a vow to the Lord
or takes an oath to obligate himself by a
pledge, he must not break his word but
must do everything he said.
3"When a young woman still living in her
father's house makes a vow to the Lord
or obligates herself by a pledge
4and her father hears about her vow or
pledge but says nothing to her, then all
her vows and every pledge by which
she obligated herself will stand.
5But if her father forbids her when he
hears about it, none of her vows or the
pledges by which she obligated herself
will stand; the Lord will release her
because her father has forbidden her.
6"If she marries after she makes a vow
or after her lips utter a rash promise by
which she obligates herself
7and her husband hears about it but
says nothing to her, then her vows or
the pledges by which she obligated
herself will stand.
8But if her husband forbids her when he
hears about it, he nullifies the vow that
obligates her or the rash promise by
which she obligates herself, and the
Lord will release her.
9"Any vow or obligation taken by a
widow or divorced woman will be
binding on her.
10"If a woman living with her husband
makes a vow or obligates herself by a
pledge under oath
11and her husband hears about it but
says nothing to her and does not forbid
her, then all her vows or the pledges by
which she obligated herself will stand.
12But if her husband nullifies them when
he hears about them, then none of the
vows or pledges that came from her lips
will stand. Her husband has nullified
them, and the Lord will release her.
13Her husband may confirm or nullify
any vow she makes or any sworn
pledge to deny herself.
14But if her husband says nothing to her
about it from day to day, then he
confirms all her vows or the pledges
binding on her. He confirms them by
saying nothing to her when he hears
about them.
15If, however, he nullifies them some
time after he hears about them, then he
is responsible for her guilt."
16These are the regulations the Lord
gave Moses concerning relationships
between a man and his wife, and
between a father and his young
daughter still living in his house.
31The Lord said to Moses,
2"Take vengeance on the Midianites for
the Israelites. After that, you will be
gathered to your people."
3So Moses said to the people, "Arm
some of your men to go to war against
the Midianites and to carry out the Lord
's vengeance on them.
4Send into battle a thousand men from
each of the tribes of Israel."
5So twelve thousand men armed for
battle, a thousand from each tribe, were
supplied from the clans of Israel.
6Moses sent them into battle, a
thousand from each tribe, along with
Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, who
took with him articles from the sanctuary
and the trumpets for signaling.
7They fought against Midian, as the Lord
commanded Moses, and killed every
man.
8Among their victims were Evi, Rekem,
Zur, Hur and Reba-the five kings of
Midian. They also killed Balaam son of
Beor with the sword.
9The Israelites captured the Midianite
women and children and took all the
Midianite herds, flocks and goods as
plunder.
10They burned all the towns where the
Midianites had settled, as well as all
their camps.
11They took all the plunder and spoils,
including the people and animals,
12and brought the captives, spoils and
plunder to Moses and Eleazar the priest
and the Israelite assembly at their camp
on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan
across from Jericho.
13Moses, Eleazar the priest and all the
leaders of the community went to meet
them outside the camp.
14Moses was angry with the officers of
the army-the commanders of thousands
and commanders of hundreds-who
returned from the battle.
15"Have you allowed all the women to
live?" he asked them.
16"They were the ones who followed
Balaam's advice and were the means of
turning the Israelites away from the Lord
in what happened at Peor, so that a
plague struck the Lord 's people.
17Now kill all the boys. And kill every
woman who has slept with a man,
18but save for yourselves every girl who
has never slept with a man.
19"All of you who have killed anyone or
touched anyone who was killed must
stay outside the camp seven days. On
the third and seventh days you must
purify yourselves and your captives.
20Purify every garment as well as
everything made of leather, goat hair or
wood."
21Then Eleazar the priest said to the
soldiers who had gone into battle, "This
is the requirement of the law that the
Lord gave Moses:
22Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead
23and anything else that can withstand
fire must be put through the fire, and
then it will be clean. But it must also be
purified with the water of cleansing. And
whatever cannot withstand fire must be
put through that water.
24On the seventh day wash your clothes
and you will be clean. Then you may
come into the camp."
25The Lord said to Moses,
26"You and Eleazar the priest and the
family heads of the community are to
count all the people and animals that
were captured.
27Divide the spoils between the soldiers
who took part in the battle and the rest
of the community.
28From the soldiers who fought in the
battle, set apart as tribute for the Lord
one out of every five hundred, whether
persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep or goats.
29Take this tribute from their half share
and give it to Eleazar the priest as the
Lord 's part.
30From the Israelites' half, select one out
of every fifty, whether persons, cattle,
donkeys, sheep, goats or other animals.
Give them to the Levites, who are
responsible for the care of the Lord 's
tabernacle."
31So Moses and Eleazar the priest did
as the Lord commanded Moses.
32The plunder remaining from the spoils
that the soldiers took was 675,000
sheep,
3372,000 cattle,
3461,000 donkeys
35and 32,000 women who had never
slept with a man.
36The half share of those who fought in
the battle was: 337,500 sheep,
37of which the tribute for the Lord was
675;
3836,000 cattle, of which the tribute for
the Lord was 72;
3930,500 donkeys, of which the tribute
for the Lord was 61;
4016,000 people, of which the tribute for
the Lord was 32.
41Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the
priest as the Lord 's part, as the Lord
commanded Moses.
42The half belonging to the Israelites,
which Moses set apart from that of the
fighting men-
43the community's half-was 337,500
sheep,
4436,000 cattle,
4530,500 donkeys
46and 16,000 people.
47From the Israelites' half, Moses
selected one out of every fifty persons
and animals, as the Lord commanded
him, and gave them to the Levites, who
were responsible for the care of the Lord
's tabernacle.
48Then the officers who were over the
units of the army-the commanders of
thousands and commanders of
hundreds-went to Moses
49and said to him, "Your servants have
counted the soldiers under our
command, and not one is missing.
50So we have brought as an offering to
the Lord the gold articles each of us
acquired-armlets, bracelets, signet rings,
earrings and necklaces-to make
atonement for ourselves before the
Lord ."
51Moses and Eleazar the priest
accepted from them the gold-all the
crafted articles.
52All the gold from the commanders of
thousands and commanders of
hundreds that Moses and Eleazar
presented as a gift to the Lord weighed
16,750 shekels.
53Each soldier had taken plunder for
himself.
54Moses and Eleazar the priest
accepted the gold from the commanders
of thousands and commanders of
hundreds and brought it into the Tent of
Meeting as a memorial for the Israelites
before the Lord .
32The Reubenites and Gadites, who
had very large herds and flocks, saw
that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were
suitable for livestock.
2So they came to Moses and Eleazar
the priest and to the leaders of the
community, and said,
3"Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah,
Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and
Beon-
4the land the Lord subdued before the
people of Israel-are suitable for livestock,
and your servants have livestock.
5If we have found favor in your eyes,"
they said, "let this land be given to your
servants as our possession. Do not
make us cross the Jordan."
6Moses said to the Gadites and
Reubenites, "Shall your countrymen go
to war while you sit here?
7Why do you discourage the Israelites
from going over into the land the Lord
has given them?
8This is what your fathers did when I
sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look
over the land.
9After they went up to the Valley of
Eshcol and viewed the land, they
discouraged the Israelites from entering
the land the Lord had given them.
10The Lord 's anger was aroused that
day and he swore this oath:
11'Because they have not followed me
wholeheartedly, not one of the men
twenty years old or more who came up
out of Egypt will see the land I promised
on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob-
12not one except Caleb son of
Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua
son of Nun, for they followed the Lord
wholeheartedly.'
13The Lord 's anger burned against
Israel and he made them wander in the
desert forty years, until the whole
generation of those who had done evil in
his sight was gone.
14"And here you are, a brood of sinners,
standing in the place of your fathers and
making the Lord even more angry with
Israel.
15If you turn away from following him, he
will again leave all this people in the
desert, and you will be the cause of their
destruction."
16Then they came up to him and said,
"We would like to build pens here for our
livestock and cities for our women and
children.
17But we are ready to arm ourselves and
go ahead of the Israelites until we have
brought them to their place. Meanwhile
our women and children will live in
fortified cities, for protection from the
inhabitants of the land.
18We will not return to our homes until
every Israelite has received his
inheritance.
19We will not receive any inheritance
with them on the other side of the
Jordan, because our inheritance has
come to us on the east side of the
Jordan."
20Then Moses said to them, "If you will
do this-if you will arm yourselves before
the Lord for battle,
21and if all of you will go armed over the
Jordan before the Lord until he has
driven his enemies out before him-
22then when the land is subdued before
the Lord , you may return and be free
from your obligation to the Lord and to
Israel. And this land will be your
possession before the Lord .
23"But if you fail to do this, you will be
sinning against the Lord ; and you may
be sure that your sin will find you out.
24Build cities for your women and
children, and pens for your flocks, but
do what you have promised."
25The Gadites and Reubenites said to
Moses, "We your servants will do as our
lord commands.
26Our children and wives, our flocks and
herds will remain here in the cities of
Gilead.
27But your servants, every man armed
for battle, will cross over to fight before
the Lord , just as our lord says."
28Then Moses gave orders about them
to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of
Nun and to the family heads of the
Israelite tribes.
29He said to them, "If the Gadites and
Reubenites, every man armed for battle,
cross over the Jordan with you before
the Lord , then when the land is
subdued before you, give them the land
of Gilead as their possession.
30But if they do not cross over with you
armed, they must accept their
possession with you in Canaan."
31The Gadites and Reubenites
answered, "Your servants will do what
the Lord has said.
32We will cross over before the Lord into
Canaan armed, but the property we
inherit will be on this side of the Jordan."
33Then Moses gave to the Gadites, the
Reubenites and the half-tribe of
Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of
Sihon king of the Amorites and the
kingdom of Og king of Bashan-the
whole land with its cities and the territory
around them.
34The Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth,
Aroer,
35Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
36Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran as
fortified cities, and built pens for their
flocks.
37And the Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon,
Elealeh and Kiriathaim,
38as well as Nebo and Baal Meon (these
names were changed) and Sibmah.
They gave names to the cities they
rebuilt.
39The descendants of Makir son of
Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it
and drove out the Amorites who were
there.
40So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites,
the descendants of Manasseh, and they
settled there.
41Jair, a descendant of Manasseh,
captured their settlements and called
them Havvoth Jair.
42And Nobah captured Kenath and its
surrounding settlements and called it
Nobah after himself.
33Here are the stages in the journey
of the Israelites when they came out of
Egypt by divisions under the leadership
of Moses and Aaron.
2At the Lord 's command Moses
recorded the stages in their journey.
This is their journey by stages:
3The Israelites set out from Rameses on
the fifteenth day of the first month, the
day after the Passover. They marched
out boldly in full view of all the Egyptians,
4who were burying all their firstborn,
whom the Lord had struck down among
them; for the Lord had brought judgment
on their gods.
5The Israelites left Rameses and
camped at Succoth.
6They left Succoth and camped at
Etham, on the edge of the desert.
7They left Etham, turned back to Pi
Hahiroth, to the east of Baal Zephon,
and camped near Migdol.
8They left Pi Hahiroth and passed
through the sea into the desert, and
when they had traveled for three days in
the Desert of Etham, they camped at
Marah.
9They left Marah and went to Elim,
where there were twelve springs and
seventy palm trees, and they camped
there.
10They left Elim and camped by the Red
Sea.
11They left the Red Sea and camped in
the Desert of Sin.
12They left the Desert of Sin and
camped at Dophkah.
13They left Dophkah and camped at
Alush.
14They left Alush and camped at
Rephidim, where there was no water for
the people to drink.
15They left Rephidim and camped in the
Desert of Sinai.
16They left the Desert of Sinai and
camped at Kibroth Hattaavah.
17They left Kibroth Hattaavah and
camped at Hazeroth.
18They left Hazeroth and camped at
Rithmah.
19They left Rithmah and camped at
Rimmon Perez.
20They left Rimmon Perez and camped
at Libnah.
21They left Libnah and camped at
Rissah.
22They left Rissah and camped at
Kehelathah.
23They left Kehelathah and camped at
Mount Shepher.
24They left Mount Shepher and camped
at Haradah.
25They left Haradah and camped at
Makheloth.
26They left Makheloth and camped at
Tahath.
27They left Tahath and camped at Terah.
28They left Terah and camped at
Mithcah.
29They left Mithcah and camped at
Hashmonah.
30They left Hashmonah and camped at
Moseroth.
31They left Moseroth and camped at
Bene Jaakan.
32They left Bene Jaakan and camped at
Hor Haggidgad.
33They left Hor Haggidgad and camped
at Jotbathah.
34They left Jotbathah and camped at
Abronah.
35They left Abronah and camped at
Ezion Geber.
36They left Ezion Geber and camped at
Kadesh, in the Desert of Zin.
37They left Kadesh and camped at
Mount Hor, on the border of Edom.
38At the Lord 's command Aaron the
priest went up Mount Hor, where he
died on the first day of the fifth month of
the fortieth year after the Israelites came
out of Egypt.
39Aaron was a hundred and twenty-three
years old when he died on Mount Hor.
40The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived
in the Negev of Canaan, heard that the
Israelites were coming.
41They left Mount Hor and camped at
Zalmonah.
42They left Zalmonah and camped at
Punon.
43They left Punon and camped at Oboth.
44They left Oboth and camped at Iye
Abarim, on the border of Moab.
45They left Iyim and camped at Dibon
Gad.
46They left Dibon Gad and camped at
Almon Diblathaim.
47They left Almon Diblathaim and
camped in the mountains of Abarim,
near Nebo.
48They left the mountains of Abarim and
camped on the plains of Moab by the
Jordan across from Jericho.
49There on the plains of Moab they
camped along the Jordan from Beth
Jeshimoth to Abel Shittim.
50On the plains of Moab by the Jordan
across from Jericho the Lord said to
Moses,
51"Speak to the Israelites and say to
them: 'When you cross the Jordan into
Canaan,
52drive out all the inhabitants of the land
before you. Destroy all their carved
images and their cast idols, and
demolish all their high places.
53Take possession of the land and settle
in it, for I have given you the land to
possess.
54Distribute the land by lot, according to
your clans. To a larger group give a
larger inheritance, and to a smaller
group a smaller one. Whatever falls to
them by lot will be theirs. Distribute it
according to your ancestral tribes.
55" 'But if you do not drive out the
inhabitants of the land, those you allow
to remain will become barbs in your
eyes and thorns in your sides. They will
give you trouble in the land where you
will live.
56And then I will do to you what I plan to
do to them.' "
34The Lord said to Moses,
2"Command the Israelites and say to
them: 'When you enter Canaan, the land
that will be allotted to you as an
inheritance will have these boundaries:
3" 'Your southern side will include some
of the Desert of Zin along the border of
Edom. On the east, your southern
boundary will start from the end of the
Salt Sea,
4cross south of Scorpion Pass, continue
on to Zin and go south of Kadesh
Barnea. Then it will go to Hazar Addar
and over to Azmon,
5where it will turn, join the Wadi of Egypt
and end at the Sea.
6" 'Your western boundary will be the
coast of the Great Sea. This will be your
boundary on the west.
7" 'For your northern boundary, run a
line from the Great Sea to Mount Hor
8and from Mount Hor to Lebo Hamath.
Then the boundary will go to Zedad,
9continue to Ziphron and end at Hazar
Enan. This will be your boundary on the
north.
10" 'For your eastern boundary, run a
line from Hazar Enan to Shepham.
11The boundary will go down from
Shepham to Riblah on the east side of
Ain and continue along the slopes east
of the Sea of Kinnereth.
12Then the boundary will go down along
the Jordan and end at the Salt Sea. "
'This will be your land, with its
boundaries on every side.' "
13Moses commanded the Israelites:
"Assign this land by lot as an inheritance.
The Lord has ordered that it be given to
the nine and a half tribes,
14because the families of the tribe of
Reuben, the tribe of Gad and the halftribe
of Manasseh have received their
inheritance.
15These two and a half tribes have
received their inheritance on the east
side of the Jordan of Jericho, toward the
sunrise."
16The Lord said to Moses,
17"These are the names of the men who
are to assign the land for you as an
inheritance: Eleazar the priest and
Joshua son of Nun.
18And appoint one leader from each
tribe to help assign the land.
19These are their names: Caleb son of
Jephunneh, from the tribe of Judah;
20Shemuel son of Ammihud, from the
tribe of Simeon;
21Elidad son of Kislon, from the tribe of
Benjamin;
22Bukki son of Jogli, the leader from the
tribe of Dan;
23Hanniel son of Ephod, the leader from
the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph;
24Kemuel son of Shiphtan, the leader
from the tribe of Ephraim son of Joseph;
25Elizaphan son of Parnach, the leader
from the tribe of Zebulun;
26Paltiel son of Azzan, the leader from
the tribe of Issachar;
27Ahihud son of Shelomi, the leader
from the tribe of Asher;
28Pedahel son of Ammihud, the leader
from the tribe of Naphtali."
29These are the men the Lord
commanded to assign the inheritance to
the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
35On the plains of Moab by the
Jordan across from Jericho, the Lord
said to Moses,
2"Command the Israelites to give the
Levites towns to live in from the
inheritance the Israelites will possess.
And give them pasturelands around the
towns.
3Then they will have towns to live in and
pasturelands for their cattle, flocks and
all their other livestock.
4"The pasturelands around the towns
that you give the Levites will extend out
fifteen hundred feet from the town wall.
5Outside the town, measure three
thousand feet on the east side, three
thousand on the south side, three
thousand on the west and three
thousand on the north, with the town in
the center. They will have this area as
pastureland for the towns.
6"Six of the towns you give the Levites
will be cities of refuge, to which a person
who has killed someone may flee. In
addition, give them forty-two other towns.
7In all you must give the Levites fortyeight
towns, together with their
pasturelands.
8The towns you give the Levites from
the land the Israelites possess are to be
given in proportion to the inheritance of
each tribe: Take many towns from a
tribe that has many, but few from one
that has few."
9Then the Lord said to Moses:
10"Speak to the Israelites and say to
them: 'When you cross the Jordan into
Canaan,
11select some towns to be your cities of
refuge, to which a person who has killed
someone accidentally may flee.
12They will be places of refuge from the
avenger, so that a person accused of
murder may not die before he stands
trial before the assembly.
13These six towns you give will be your
cities of refuge.
14Give three on this side of the Jordan
and three in Canaan as cities of refuge.
15These six towns will be a place of
refuge for Israelites, aliens and any
other people living among them, so that
anyone who has killed another
accidentally can flee there.
16" 'If a man strikes someone with an
iron object so that he dies, he is a
murderer; the murderer shall be put to
death.
17Or if anyone has a stone in his hand
that could kill, and he strikes someone
so that he dies, he is a murderer; the
murderer shall be put to death.
18Or if anyone has a wooden object in
his hand that could kill, and he hits
someone so that he dies, he is a
murderer; the murderer shall be put to
death.
19The avenger of blood shall put the
murderer to death; when he meets him,
he shall put him to death.
20If anyone with malice aforethought
shoves another or throws something at
him intentionally so that he dies
21or if in hostility he hits him with his fist
so that he dies, that person shall be put
to death; he is a murderer. The avenger
of blood shall put the murderer to death
when he meets him.
22" 'But if without hostility someone
suddenly shoves another or throws
something at him unintentionally
23or, without seeing him, drops a stone
on him that could kill him, and he dies,
then since he was not his enemy and he
did not intend to harm him,
24the assembly must judge between him
and the avenger of blood according to
these regulations.
25The assembly must protect the one
accused of murder from the avenger of
blood and send him back to the city of
refuge to which he fled. He must stay
there until the death of the high priest,
who was anointed with the holy oil.
26" 'But if the accused ever goes outside
the limits of the city of refuge to which
he has fled
27and the avenger of blood finds him
outside the city, the avenger of blood
may kill the accused without being guilty
of murder.
28The accused must stay in his city of
refuge until the death of the high priest;
only after the death of the high priest
may he return to his own property.
29" 'These are to be legal requirements
for you throughout the generations to
come, wherever you live.
30" 'Anyone who kills a person is to be
put to death as a murderer only on the
testimony of witnesses. But no one is to
be put to death on the testimony of only
one witness.
31" 'Do not accept a ransom for the life of
a murderer, who deserves to die. He
must surely be put to death.
32" 'Do not accept a ransom for anyone
who has fled to a city of refuge and so
allow him to go back and live on his own
land before the death of the high priest.
33" 'Do not pollute the land where you
are. Bloodshed pollutes the land, and
atonement cannot be made for the land
on which blood has been shed, except
by the blood of the one who shed it.
34Do not defile the land where you live
and where I dwell, for I, the Lord , dwell
among the Israelites.' "
36The family heads of the clan of
Gilead son of Makir, the son of
Manasseh, who were from the clans of
the descendants of Joseph, came and
spoke before Moses and the leaders,
the heads of the Israelite families.
2They said, "When the Lord commanded
my lord to give the land as an
inheritance to the Israelites by lot, he
ordered you to give the inheritance of
our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.
3Now suppose they marry men from
other Israelite tribes; then their
inheritance will be taken from our
ancestral inheritance and added to that
of the tribe they marry into. And so part
of the inheritance allotted to us will be
taken away.
4When the Year of Jubilee for the
Israelites comes, their inheritance will be
added to that of the tribe into which they
marry, and their property will be taken
from the tribal inheritance of our
forefathers."
5Then at the Lord 's command Moses
gave this order to the Israelites: "What
the tribe of the descendants of Joseph is
saying is right.
6This is what the Lord commands for
Zelophehad's daughters: They may
marry anyone they please as long as
they marry within the tribal clan of their
father.
7No inheritance in Israel is to pass from
tribe to tribe, for every Israelite shall
keep the tribal land inherited from his
forefathers.
8Every daughter who inherits land in any
Israelite tribe must marry someone in
her father's tribal clan, so that every
Israelite will possess the inheritance of
his fathers.
9No inheritance may pass from tribe to
tribe, for each Israelite tribe is to keep
the land it inherits."
10So Zelophehad's daughters did as the
Lord commanded Moses.
11Zelophehad's daughters-Mahlah,
Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noahmarried
their cousins on their father's
side.
12They married within the clans of the
descendants of Manasseh son of
Joseph, and their inheritance remained
in their father's clan and tribe.
13These are the commands and
regulations the Lord gave through
Moses to the Israelites on the plains of
Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
Deuteronomy
1These are the words Moses spoke to
all Israel in the desert east of the
Jordan-that is, in the Arabah-opposite
Suph, between Paran and Tophel,
Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab.
2(It takes eleven days to go from Horeb
to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir
road.)
3In the fortieth year, on the first day of
the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed
to the Israelites all that the Lord had
commanded him concerning them.
4This was after he had defeated Sihon
king of the Amorites, who reigned in
Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated Og
king of Bashan, who reigned in
Ashtaroth.
5East of the Jordan in the territory of
Moab, Moses began to expound this law,
saying:
6The Lord our God said to us at Horeb,
"You have stayed long enough at this
mountain.
7Break camp and advance into the hill
country of the Amorites; go to all the
neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in
the mountains, in the western foothills,
in the Negev and along the coast, to the
land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon,
as far as the great river, the Euphrates.
8See, I have given you this land. Go in
and take possession of the land that the
Lord swore he would give to your
fathers-to Abraham, Isaac and Jacoband
to their descendants after them."
9At that time I said to you, "You are too
heavy a burden for me to carry alone.
10The Lord your God has increased your
numbers so that today you are as many
as the stars in the sky.
11May the Lord , the God of your fathers,
increase you a thousand times and
bless you as he has promised!
12But how can I bear your problems and
your burdens and your disputes all by
myself?
13Choose some wise, understanding
and respected men from each of your
tribes, and I will set them over you."
14You answered me, "What you propose
to do is good."
15So I took the leading men of your
tribes, wise and respected men, and
appointed them to have authority over
you-as commanders of thousands, of
hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as
tribal officials.
16And I charged your judges at that time:
Hear the disputes between your
brothers and judge fairly, whether the
case is between brother Israelites or
between one of them and an alien.
17Do not show partiality in judging; hear
both small and great alike. Do not be
afraid of any man, for judgment belongs
to God. Bring me any case too hard for
you, and I will hear it.
18And at that time I told you everything
you were to do.
19Then, as the Lord our God
commanded us, we set out from Horeb
and went toward the hill country of the
Amorites through all that vast and
dreadful desert that you have seen, and
so we reached Kadesh Barnea.
20Then I said to you, "You have reached
the hill country of the Amorites, which
the Lord our God is giving us.
21See, the Lord your God has given you
the land. Go up and take possession of
it as the Lord , the God of your fathers,
told you. Do not be afraid; do not be
discouraged."
22Then all of you came to me and said,
"Let us send men ahead to spy out the
land for us and bring back a report
about the route we are to take and the
towns we will come to."
23The idea seemed good to me; so I
selected twelve of you, one man from
each tribe.
24They left and went up into the hill
country, and came to the Valley of
Eshcol and explored it.
25Taking with them some of the fruit of
the land, they brought it down to us and
reported, "It is a good land that the Lord
our God is giving us."
26But you were unwilling to go up; you
rebelled against the command of the
Lord your God.
27You grumbled in your tents and said,
"The Lord hates us; so he brought us
out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands
of the Amorites to destroy us.
28Where can we go? Our brothers have
made us lose heart. They say, 'The
people are stronger and taller than we
are; the cities are large, with walls up to
the sky. We even saw the Anakites
there.' "
29Then I said to you, "Do not be terrified;
do not be afraid of them.
30The Lord your God, who is going
before you, will fight for you, as he did
for you in Egypt, before your very eyes,
31and in the desert. There you saw how
the Lord your God carried you, as a
father carries his son, all the way you
went until you reached this place."
32In spite of this, you did not trust in the
Lord your God,
33who went ahead of you on your
journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by
day, to search out places for you to
camp and to show you the way you
should go.
34When the Lord heard what you said,
he was angry and solemnly swore:
35"Not a man of this evil generation shall
see the good land I swore to give your
forefathers,
36except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He
will see it, and I will give him and his
descendants the land he set his feet on,
because he followed the Lord
wholeheartedly."
37Because of you the Lord became
angry with me also and said, "You shall
not enter it, either.
38But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun,
will enter it. Encourage him, because he
will lead Israel to inherit it.
39And the little ones that you said would
be taken captive, your children who do
not yet know good from bad-they will
enter the land. I will give it to them and
they will take possession of it.
40But as for you, turn around and set out
toward the desert along the route to the
Red Sea. "
41Then you replied, "We have sinned
against the Lord . We will go up and
fight, as the Lord our God commanded
us." So every one of you put on his
weapons, thinking it easy to go up into
the hill country.
42But the Lord said to me, "Tell them,
'Do not go up and fight, because I will
not be with you. You will be defeated by
your enemies.' "
43So I told you, but you would not listen.
You rebelled against the Lord 's
command and in your arrogance you
marched up into the hill country.
44The Amorites who lived in those hills
came out against you; they chased you
like a swarm of bees and beat you down
from Seir all the way to Hormah.
45You came back and wept before the
Lord , but he paid no attention to your
weeping and turned a deaf ear to you.
46And so you stayed in Kadesh many
days-all the time you spent there.
2Then we turned back and set out
toward the desert along the route to the
Red Sea, as the Lord had directed me.
For a long time we made our way
around the hill country of Seir.
2Then the Lord said to me,
3"You have made your way around this
hill country long enough; now turn north.
4Give the people these orders: 'You are
about to pass through the territory of
your brothers the descendants of Esau,
who live in Seir. They will be afraid of
you, but be very careful.
5Do not provoke them to war, for I will
not give you any of their land, not even
enough to put your foot on. I have given
Esau the hill country of Seir as his own.
6You are to pay them in silver for the
food you eat and the water you drink.' "
7The Lord your God has blessed you in
all the work of your hands. He has
watched over your journey through this
vast desert. These forty years the Lord
your God has been with you, and you
have not lacked anything.
8So we went on past our brothers the
descendants of Esau, who live in Seir.
We turned from the Arabah road, which
comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber,
and traveled along the desert road of
Moab.
9Then the Lord said to me, "Do not
harass the Moabites or provoke them to
war, for I will not give you any part of
their land. I have given Ar to the
descendants of Lot as a possession."
10(The Emites used to live there-a
people strong and numerous, and as tall
as the Anakites.
11Like the Anakites, they too were
considered Rephaites, but the Moabites
called them Emites.
12Horites used to live in Seir, but the
descendants of Esau drove them out.
They destroyed the Horites from before
them and settled in their place, just as
Israel did in the land the Lord gave them
as their possession.)
13And the Lord said, "Now get up and
cross the Zered Valley." So we crossed
the valley.
14Thirty-eight years passed from the
time we left Kadesh Barnea until we
crossed the Zered Valley. By then, that
entire generation of fighting men had
perished from the camp, as the Lord
had sworn to them.
15The Lord 's hand was against them
until he had completely eliminated them
from the camp.
16Now when the last of these fighting
men among the people had died,
17the Lord said to me,
18"Today you are to pass by the region
of Moab at Ar.
19When you come to the Ammonites, do
not harass them or provoke them to war,
for I will not give you possession of any
land belonging to the Ammonites. I have
given it as a possession to the
descendants of Lot."
20(That too was considered a land of the
Rephaites, who used to live there; but
the Ammonites called them
Zamzummites.
21They were a people strong and
numerous, and as tall as the Anakites.
The Lord destroyed them from before
the Ammonites, who drove them out and
settled in their place.
22The Lord had done the same for the
descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir,
when he destroyed the Horites from
before them. They drove them out and
have lived in their place to this day.
23And as for the Avvites who lived in
villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites
coming out from Caphtor destroyed
them and settled in their place.)
24"Set out now and cross the Arnon
Gorge. See, I have given into your hand
Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and
his country. Begin to take possession of
it and engage him in battle.
25This very day I will begin to put the
terror and fear of you on all the nations
under heaven. They will hear reports of
you and will tremble and be in anguish
because of you."
26From the desert of Kedemoth I sent
messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon
offering peace and saying,
27"Let us pass through your country. We
will stay on the main road; we will not
turn aside to the right or to the left.
28Sell us food to eat and water to drink
for their price in silver. Only let us pass
through on foot-
29as the descendants of Esau, who live
in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar,
did for us-until we cross the Jordan into
the land the Lord our God is giving us."
30But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to
let us pass through. For the Lord your
God had made his spirit stubborn and
his heart obstinate in order to give him
into your hands, as he has now done.
31The Lord said to me, "See, I have
begun to deliver Sihon and his country
over to you. Now begin to conquer and
possess his land."
32When Sihon and all his army came out
to meet us in battle at Jahaz,
33the Lord our God delivered him over to
us and we struck him down, together
with his sons and his whole army.
34At that time we took all his towns and
completely destroyed them-men,
women and children. We left no
survivors.
35But the livestock and the plunder from
the towns we had captured we carried
off for ourselves.
36From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon
Gorge, and from the town in the gorge,
even as far as Gilead, not one town was
too strong for us. The Lord our God
gave us all of them.
37But in accordance with the command
of the Lord our God, you did not
encroach on any of the land of the
Ammonites, neither the land along the
course of the Jabbok nor that around
the towns in the hills.
3Next we turned and went up along
the road toward Bashan, and Og king of
Bashan with his whole army marched
out to meet us in battle at Edrei.
2The Lord said to me, "Do not be afraid
of him, for I have handed him over to
you with his whole army and his land.
Do to him what you did to Sihon king of
the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon."
3So the Lord our God also gave into our
hands Og king of Bashan and all his
army. We struck them down, leaving no
survivors.
4At that time we took all his cities. There
was not one of the sixty cities that we
did not take from them-the whole region
of Argob, Og's kingdom in Bashan.
5All these cities were fortified with high
walls and with gates and bars, and there
were also a great many unwalled
villages.
6We completely destroyed them, as we
had done with Sihon king of Heshbon,
destroying every city-men, women and
children.
7But all the livestock and the plunder
from their cities we carried off for
ourselves.
8So at that time we took from these two
kings of the Amorites the territory east of
the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge as far
as Mount Hermon.
9(Hermon is called Sirion by the
Sidonians; the Amorites call it Senir.)
10We took all the towns on the plateau,
and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as
Salecah and Edrei, towns of Og's
kingdom in Bashan.
11(Only Og king of Bashan was left of
the remnant of the Rephaites. His bed
was made of iron and was more than
thirteen feet long and six feet wide. It is
still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)
12Of the land that we took over at that
time, I gave the Reubenites and the
Gadites the territory north of Aroer by
the Arnon Gorge, including half the hill
country of Gilead, together with its
towns.
13The rest of Gilead and also all of
Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to
the half tribe of Manasseh. (The whole
region of Argob in Bashan used to be
known as a land of the Rephaites.
14Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took
the whole region of Argob as far as the
border of the Geshurites and the
Maacathites; it was named after him, so
that to this day Bashan is called
Havvoth Jair. )
15And I gave Gilead to Makir.
16But to the Reubenites and the Gadites
I gave the territory extending from
Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the
middle of the gorge being the border)
and out to the Jabbok River, which is
the border of the Ammonites.
17Its western border was the Jordan in
the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the Sea of
the Arabah (the Salt Sea ), below the
slopes of Pisgah.
18I commanded you at that time: "The
Lord your God has given you this land to
take possession of it. But all your ablebodied
men, armed for battle, must
cross over ahead of your brother
Israelites.
19However, your wives, your children
and your livestock (I know you have
much livestock) may stay in the towns I
have given you,
20until the Lord gives rest to your
brothers as he has to you, and they too
have taken over the land that the Lord
your God is giving them, across the
Jordan. After that, each of you may go
back to the possession I have given
you."
21At that time I commanded Joshua:
"You have seen with your own eyes all
that the Lord your God has done to
these two kings. The Lord will do the
same to all the kingdoms over there
where you are going.
22Do not be afraid of them; the Lord your
God himself will fight for you."
23At that time I pleaded with the Lord :
24"O Sovereign Lord , you have begun to
show to your servant your greatness
and your strong hand. For what god is
there in heaven or on earth who can do
the deeds and mighty works you do?
25Let me go over and see the good land
beyond the Jordan-that fine hill country
and Lebanon."
26But because of you the Lord was
angry with me and would not listen to
me. "That is enough," the Lord said. "Do
not speak to me anymore about this
matter.
27Go up to the top of Pisgah and look
west and north and south and east.
Look at the land with your own eyes,
since you are not going to cross this
Jordan.
28But commission Joshua, and
encourage and strengthen him, for he
will lead this people across and will
cause them to inherit the land that you
will see."
29So we stayed in the valley near Beth
Peor.
4Hear now, O Israel, the decrees and
laws I am about to teach you. Follow
them so that you may live and may go in
and take possession of the land that the
Lord , the God of your fathers, is giving
you.
2Do not add to what I command you and
do not subtract from it, but keep the
commands of the Lord your God that I
give you.
3You saw with your own eyes what the
Lord did at Baal Peor. The Lord your
God destroyed from among you
everyone who followed the Baal of Peor,
4but all of you who held fast to the Lord
your God are still alive today.
5See, I have taught you decrees and
laws as the Lord my God commanded
me, so that you may follow them in the
land you are entering to take possession
of it.
6Observe them carefully, for this will
show your wisdom and understanding to
the nations, who will hear about all
these decrees and say, "Surely this
great nation is a wise and understanding
people."
7What other nation is so great as to
have their gods near them the way the
Lord our God is near us whenever we
pray to him?
8And what other nation is so great as to
have such righteous decrees and laws
as this body of laws I am setting before
you today?
9Only be careful, and watch yourselves
closely so that you do not forget the
things your eyes have seen or let them
slip from your heart as long as you live.
Teach them to your children and to their
children after them.
10Remember the day you stood before
the Lord your God at Horeb, when he
said to me, "Assemble the people before
me to hear my words so that they may
learn to revere me as long as they live in
the land and may teach them to their
children."
11You came near and stood at the foot
of the mountain while it blazed with fire
to the very heavens, with black clouds
and deep darkness.
12Then the Lord spoke to you out of the
fire. You heard the sound of words but
saw no form; there was only a voice.
13He declared to you his covenant, the
Ten Commandments, which he
commanded you to follow and then
wrote them on two stone tablets.
14And the Lord directed me at that time
to teach you the decrees and laws you
are to follow in the land that you are
crossing the Jordan to possess.
15You saw no form of any kind the day
the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of
the fire. Therefore watch yourselves
very carefully,
16so that you do not become corrupt and
make for yourselves an idol, an image of
any shape, whether formed like a man
or a woman,
17or like any animal on earth or any bird
that flies in the air,
18or like any creature that moves along
the ground or any fish in the waters
below.
19And when you look up to the sky and
see the sun, the moon and the stars-all
the heavenly array-do not be enticed
into bowing down to them and
worshiping things the Lord your God has
apportioned to all the nations under
heaven.
20But as for you, the Lord took you and
brought you out of the iron-smelting
furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people
of his inheritance, as you now are.
21The Lord was angry with me because
of you, and he solemnly swore that I
would not cross the Jordan and enter
the good land the Lord your God is
giving you as your inheritance.
22I will die in this land; I will not cross the
Jordan; but you are about to cross over
and take possession of that good land.
23Be careful not to forget the covenant of
the Lord your God that he made with
you; do not make for yourselves an idol
in the form of anything the Lord your
God has forbidden.
24For the Lord your God is a consuming
fire, a jealous God.
25After you have had children and
grandchildren and have lived in the land
a long time-if you then become corrupt
and make any kind of idol, doing evil in
the eyes of the Lord your God and
provoking him to anger,
26I call heaven and earth as witnesses
against you this day that you will quickly
perish from the land that you are
crossing the Jordan to possess. You will
not live there long but will certainly be
destroyed.
27The Lord will scatter you among the
peoples, and only a few of you will
survive among the nations to which the
Lord will drive you.
28There you will worship man-made
gods of wood and stone, which cannot
see or hear or eat or smell.
29But if from there you seek the Lord
your God, you will find him if you look for
him with all your heart and with all your
soul.
30When you are in distress and all these
things have happened to you, then in
later days you will return to the Lord
your God and obey him.
31For the Lord your God is a merciful
God; he will not abandon or destroy you
or forget the covenant with your
forefathers, which he confirmed to them
by oath.
32Ask now about the former days, long
before your time, from the day God
created man on the earth; ask from one
end of the heavens to the other. Has
anything so great as this ever happened,
or has anything like it ever been heard
of?
33Has any other people heard the voice
of God speaking out of fire, as you have,
and lived?
34Has any god ever tried to take for
himself one nation out of another nation,
by testings, by miraculous signs and
wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and
an outstretched arm, or by great and
awesome deeds, like all the things the
Lord your God did for you in Egypt
before your very eyes?
35You were shown these things so that
you might know that the Lord is God;
besides him there is no other.
36From heaven he made you hear his
voice to discipline you. On earth he
showed you his great fire, and you
heard his words from out of the fire.
37Because he loved your forefathers and
chose their descendants after them, he
brought you out of Egypt by his
Presence and his great strength,
38to drive out before you nations greater
and stronger than you and to bring you
into their land to give it to you for your
inheritance, as it is today.
39Acknowledge and take to heart this
day that the Lord is God in heaven
above and on the earth below. There is
no other.
40Keep his decrees and commands,
which I am giving you today, so that it
may go well with you and your children
after you and that you may live long in
the land the Lord your God gives you for
all time.
41Then Moses set aside three cities east
of the Jordan,
42to which anyone who had killed a
person could flee if he had
unintentionally killed his neighbor
without malice aforethought. He could
flee into one of these cities and save his
life.
43The cities were these: Bezer in the
desert plateau, for the Reubenites;
Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and
Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
44This is the law Moses set before the
Israelites.
45These are the stipulations, decrees
and laws Moses gave them when they
came out of Egypt
46and were in the valley near Beth Peor
east of the Jordan, in the land of Sihon
king of the Amorites, who reigned in
Heshbon and was defeated by Moses
and the Israelites as they came out of
Egypt.
47They took possession of his land and
the land of Og king of Bashan, the two
Amorite kings east of the Jordan.
48This land extended from Aroer on the
rim of the Arnon Gorge to Mount Siyon
(that is, Hermon),
49and included all the Arabah east of the
Jordan, as far as the Sea of the Arabah,
below the slopes of Pisgah.
5Moses summoned all Israel and said:
Hear, O Israel, the decrees and laws I
declare in your hearing today. Learn
them and be sure to follow them.
2The Lord our God made a covenant
with us at Horeb.
3It was not with our fathers that the Lord
made this covenant, but with us, with all
of us who are alive here today.
4The Lord spoke to you face to face out
of the fire on the mountain.
5(At that time I stood between the Lord
and you to declare to you the word of
the Lord , because you were afraid of
the fire and did not go up the mountain.)
And he said:
6"I am the Lord your God, who brought
you out of Egypt, out of the land of
slavery.
7"You shall have no other gods before
me.
8"You shall not make for yourself an idol
in the form of anything in heaven above
or on the earth beneath or in the waters
below.
9You shall not bow down to them or
worship them; for I, the Lord your God,
am a jealous God, punishing the
children for the sin of the fathers to the
third and fourth generation of those who
hate me,
10but showing love to a thousand
generations of those who love me and
keep my commandments.
11"You shall not misuse the name of the
Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold
anyone guiltless who misuses his name.
12"Observe the Sabbath day by keeping
it holy, as the Lord your God has
commanded you.
13Six days you shall labor and do all
your work,
14but the seventh day is a Sabbath to
the Lord your God. On it you shall not
do any work, neither you, nor your son
or daughter, nor your manservant or
maidservant, nor your ox, your donkey
or any of your animals, nor the alien
within your gates, so that your
manservant and maidservant may rest,
as you do.
15Remember that you were slaves in
Egypt and that the Lord your God
brought you out of there with a mighty
hand and an outstretched arm.
Therefore the Lord your God has
commanded you to observe the
Sabbath day.
16"Honor your father and your mother,
as the Lord your God has commanded
you, so that you may live long and that it
may go well with you in the land the
Lord your God is giving you.
17"You shall not murder.
18"You shall not commit adultery.
19"You shall not steal.
20"You shall not give false testimony
against your neighbor.
21"You shall not covet your neighbor's
wife. You shall not set your desire on
your neighbor's house or land, his
manservant or maidservant, his ox or
donkey, or anything that belongs to your
neighbor."
22These are the commandments the
Lord proclaimed in a loud voice to your
whole assembly there on the mountain
from out of the fire, the cloud and the
deep darkness; and he added nothing
more. Then he wrote them on two stone
tablets and gave them to me.
23When you heard the voice out of the
darkness, while the mountain was
ablaze with fire, all the leading men of
your tribes and your elders came to me.
24And you said, "The Lord our God has
shown us his glory and his majesty, and
we have heard his voice from the fire.
Today we have seen that a man can live
even if God speaks with him.
25But now, why should we die? This
great fire will consume us, and we will
die if we hear the voice of the Lord our
God any longer.
26For what mortal man has ever heard
the voice of the living God speaking out
of fire, as we have, and survived?
27Go near and listen to all that the Lord
our God says. Then tell us whatever the
Lord our God tells you. We will listen
and obey."
28The Lord heard you when you spoke
to me and the Lord said to me, "I have
heard what this people said to you.
Everything they said was good.
29Oh, that their hearts would be inclined
to fear me and keep all my commands
always, so that it might go well with
them and their children forever!
30"Go, tell them to return to their tents.
31But you stay here with me so that I
may give you all the commands,
decrees and laws you are to teach them
to follow in the land I am giving them to
possess."
32So be careful to do what the Lord your
God has commanded you; do not turn
aside to the right or to the left.
33Walk in all the way that the Lord your
God has commanded you, so that you
may live and prosper and prolong your
days in the land that you will possess.
6These are the commands, decrees
and laws the Lord your God directed me
to teach you to observe in the land that
you are crossing the Jordan to possess,
2so that you, your children and their
children after them may fear the Lord
your God as long as you live by keeping
all his decrees and commands that I
give you, and so that you may enjoy
long life.
3Hear, O Israel, and be careful to obey
so that it may go well with you and that
you may increase greatly in a land
flowing with milk and honey, just as the
Lord , the God of your fathers, promised
you.
4Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the
Lord is one.
5Love the Lord your God with all your
heart and with all your soul and with all
your strength.
6These commandments that I give you
today are to be upon your hearts.
7Impress them on your children. Talk
about them when you sit at home and
when you walk along the road, when
you lie down and when you get up.
8Tie them as symbols on your hands
and bind them on your foreheads.
9Write them on the doorframes of your
houses and on your gates.
10When the Lord your God brings you
into the land he swore to your fathers, to
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give youa
land with large, flourishing cities you
did not build,
11houses filled with all kinds of good
things you did not provide, wells you did
not dig, and vineyards and olive groves
you did not plant-then when you eat and
are satisfied,
12be careful that you do not forget the
Lord , who brought you out of Egypt, out
of the land of slavery.
13Fear the Lord your God, serve him
only and take your oaths in his name.
14Do not follow other gods, the gods of
the peoples around you;
15for the Lord your God, who is among
you, is a jealous God and his anger will
burn against you, and he will destroy
you from the face of the land.
16Do not test the Lord your God as you
did at Massah.
17Be sure to keep the commands of the
Lord your God and the stipulations and
decrees he has given you.
18Do what is right and good in the Lord
's sight, so that it may go well with you
and you may go in and take over the
good land that the Lord promised on
oath to your forefathers,
19thrusting out all your enemies before
you, as the Lord said.
20In the future, when your son asks you,
"What is the meaning of the stipulations,
decrees and laws the Lord our God has
commanded you?"
21tell him: "We were slaves of Pharaoh
in Egypt, but the Lord brought us out of
Egypt with a mighty hand.
22Before our eyes the Lord sent
miraculous signs and wonders-great
and terrible-upon Egypt and Pharaoh
and his whole household.
23But he brought us out from there to
bring us in and give us the land that he
promised on oath to our forefathers.
24The Lord commanded us to obey all
these decrees and to fear the Lord our
God, so that we might always prosper
and be kept alive, as is the case today.
25And if we are careful to obey all this
law before the Lord our God, as he has
commanded us, that will be our
righteousness."
7When the Lord your God brings you
into the land you are entering to
possess and drives out before you many
nations-the Hittites, Girgashites,
Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites,
Hivites and Jebusites, seven nations
larger and stronger than you-
2and when the Lord your God has
delivered them over to you and you
have defeated them, then you must
destroy them totally. Make no treaty with
them, and show them no mercy.
3Do not intermarry with them. Do not
give your daughters to their sons or take
their daughters for your sons,
4for they will turn your sons away from
following me to serve other gods, and
the Lord 's anger will burn against you
and will quickly destroy you.
5This is what you are to do to them:
Break down their altars, smash their
sacred stones, cut down their Asherah
poles and burn their idols in the fire.
6For you are a people holy to the Lord
your God. The Lord your God has
chosen you out of all the peoples on the
face of the earth to be his people, his
treasured possession.
7The Lord did not set his affection on
you and choose you because you were
more numerous than other peoples, for
you were the fewest of all peoples.
8But it was because the Lord loved you
and kept the oath he swore to your
forefathers that he brought you out with
a mighty hand and redeemed you from
the land of slavery, from the power of
Pharaoh king of Egypt.
9Know therefore that the Lord your God
is God; he is the faithful God, keeping
his covenant of love to a thousand
generations of those who love him and
keep his commands.
10But those who hate him he will repay
to their face by destruction; he will not
be slow to repay to their face those who
hate him.
11Therefore, take care to follow the
commands, decrees and laws I give you
today.
12If you pay attention to these laws and
are careful to follow them, then the Lord
your God will keep his covenant of love
with you, as he swore to your
forefathers.
13He will love you and bless you and
increase your numbers. He will bless the
fruit of your womb, the crops of your
land-your grain, new wine and oil-the
calves of your herds and the lambs of
your flocks in the land that he swore to
your forefathers to give you.
14You will be blessed more than any
other people; none of your men or
women will be childless, nor any of your
livestock without young.
15The Lord will keep you free from every
disease. He will not inflict on you the
horrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but
he will inflict them on all who hate you.
16You must destroy all the peoples the
Lord your God gives over to you. Do not
look on them with pity and do not serve
their gods, for that will be a snare to you.
17You may say to yourselves, "These
nations are stronger than we are. How
can we drive them out?"
18But do not be afraid of them;
remember well what the Lord your God
did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.
19You saw with your own eyes the great
trials, the miraculous signs and wonders,
the mighty hand and outstretched arm,
with which the Lord your God brought
you out. The Lord your God will do the
same to all the peoples you now fear.
20Moreover, the Lord your God will send
the hornet among them until even the
survivors who hide from you have
perished.
21Do not be terrified by them, for the
Lord your God, who is among you, is a
great and awesome God.
22The Lord your God will drive out those
nations before you, little by little. You will
not be allowed to eliminate them all at
once, or the wild animals will multiply
around you.
23But the Lord your God will deliver them
over to you, throwing them into great
confusion until they are destroyed.
24He will give their kings into your hand,
and you will wipe out their names from
under heaven. No one will be able to
stand up against you; you will destroy
them.
25The images of their gods you are to
burn in the fire. Do not covet the silver
and gold on them, and do not take it for
yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it,
for it is detestable to the Lord your God.
26Do not bring a detestable thing into
your house or you, like it, will be set
apart for destruction. Utterly abhor and
detest it, for it is set apart for destruction.
8Be careful to follow every command I
am giving you today, so that you may
live and increase and may enter and
possess the land that the Lord promised
on oath to your forefathers.
2Remember how the Lord your God led
you all the way in the desert these forty
years, to humble you and to test you in
order to know what was in your heart,
whether or not you would keep his
commands.
3He humbled you, causing you to
hunger and then feeding you with
manna, which neither you nor your
fathers had known, to teach you that
man does not live on bread alone but on
every word that comes from the mouth
of the Lord .
4Your clothes did not wear out and your
feet did not swell during these forty
years.
5Know then in your heart that as a man
disciplines his son, so the Lord your
God disciplines you.
6Observe the commands of the Lord
your God, walking in his ways and
revering him.
7For the Lord your God is bringing you
into a good land-a land with streams
and pools of water, with springs flowing
in the valleys and hills;
8a land with wheat and barley, vines and
fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil and
honey;
9a land where bread will not be scarce
and you will lack nothing; a land where
the rocks are iron and you can dig
copper out of the hills.
10When you have eaten and are
satisfied, praise the Lord your God for
the good land he has given you.
11Be careful that you do not forget the
Lord your God, failing to observe his
commands, his laws and his decrees
that I am giving you this day.
12Otherwise, when you eat and are
satisfied, when you build fine houses
and settle down,
13and when your herds and flocks grow
large and your silver and gold increase
and all you have is multiplied,
14then your heart will become proud and
you will forget the Lord your God, who
brought you out of Egypt, out of the land
of slavery.
15He led you through the vast and
dreadful desert, that thirsty and
waterless land, with its venomous
snakes and scorpions. He brought you
water out of hard rock.
16He gave you manna to eat in the
desert, something your fathers had
never known, to humble and to test you
so that in the end it might go well with
you.
17You may say to yourself, "My power
and the strength of my hands have
produced this wealth for me."
18But remember the Lord your God, for it
is he who gives you the ability to
produce wealth, and so confirms his
covenant, which he swore to your
forefathers, as it is today.
19If you ever forget the Lord your God
and follow other gods and worship and
bow down to them, I testify against you
today that you will surely be destroyed.
20Like the nations the Lord destroyed
before you, so you will be destroyed for
not obeying the Lord your God.
9Hear, O Israel. You are now about to
cross the Jordan to go in and
dispossess nations greater and stronger
than you, with large cities that have
walls up to the sky.
2The people are strong and tall-
Anakites! You know about them and
have heard it said: "Who can stand up
against the Anakites?"
3But be assured today that the Lord your
God is the one who goes across ahead
of you like a devouring fire. He will
destroy them; he will subdue them
before you. And you will drive them out
and annihilate them quickly, as the Lord
has promised you.
4After the Lord your God has driven
them out before you, do not say to
yourself, "The Lord has brought me here
to take possession of this land because
of my righteousness." No, it is on
account of the wickedness of these
nations that the Lord is going to drive
them out before you.
5It is not because of your righteousness
or your integrity that you are going in to
take possession of their land; but on
account of the wickedness of these
nations, the Lord your God will drive
them out before you, to accomplish what
he swore to your fathers, to Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob.
6Understand, then, that it is not because
of your righteousness that the Lord your
God is giving you this good land to
possess, for you are a stiff-necked
people.
7Remember this and never forget how
you provoked the Lord your God to
anger in the desert. From the day you
left Egypt until you arrived here, you
have been rebellious against the Lord .
8At Horeb you aroused the Lord 's wrath
so that he was angry enough to destroy
you.
9When I went up on the mountain to
receive the tablets of stone, the tablets
of the covenant that the Lord had made
with you, I stayed on the mountain forty
days and forty nights; I ate no bread and
drank no water.
10The Lord gave me two stone tablets
inscribed by the finger of God. On them
were all the commandments the Lord
proclaimed to you on the mountain out
of the fire, on the day of the assembly.
11At the end of the forty days and forty
nights, the Lord gave me the two stone
tablets, the tablets of the covenant.
12Then the Lord told me, "Go down from
here at once, because your people
whom you brought out of Egypt have
become corrupt. They have turned away
quickly from what I commanded them
and have made a cast idol for
themselves."
13And the Lord said to me, "I have seen
this people, and they are a stiff-necked
people indeed!
14Let me alone, so that I may destroy
them and blot out their name from under
heaven. And I will make you into a
nation stronger and more numerous
than they."
15So I turned and went down from the
mountain while it was ablaze with fire.
And the two tablets of the covenant
were in my hands.
16When I looked, I saw that you had
sinned against the Lord your God; you
had made for yourselves an idol cast in
the shape of a calf. You had turned
aside quickly from the way that the Lord
had commanded you.
17So I took the two tablets and threw
them out of my hands, breaking them to
pieces before your eyes.
18Then once again I fell prostrate before
the Lord for forty days and forty nights; I
ate no bread and drank no water,
because of all the sin you had
committed, doing what was evil in the
Lord 's sight and so provoking him to
anger.
19I feared the anger and wrath of the
Lord , for he was angry enough with you
to destroy you. But again the Lord
listened to me.
20And the Lord was angry enough with
Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I
prayed for Aaron too.
21Also I took that sinful thing of yours,
the calf you had made, and burned it in
the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it
to powder as fine as dust and threw the
dust into a stream that flowed down the
mountain.
22You also made the Lord angry at
Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth
Hattaavah.
23And when the Lord sent you out from
Kadesh Barnea, he said, "Go up and
take possession of the land I have given
you." But you rebelled against the
command of the Lord your God. You did
not trust him or obey him.
24You have been rebellious against the
Lord ever since I have known you.
25I lay prostrate before the Lord those
forty days and forty nights because the
Lord had said he would destroy you.
26I prayed to the Lord and said, "O
Sovereign Lord , do not destroy your
people, your own inheritance that you
redeemed by your great power and
brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
27Remember your servants Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the
stubbornness of this people, their
wickedness and their sin.
28Otherwise, the country from which you
brought us will say, 'Because the Lord
was not able to take them into the land
he had promised them, and because he
hated them, he brought them out to put
them to death in the desert.'
29But they are your people, your
inheritance that you brought out by your
great power and your outstretched arm."
10At that time the Lord said to me,
"Chisel out two stone tablets like the first
ones and come up to me on the
mountain. Also make a wooden chest.
2I will write on the tablets the words that
were on the first tablets, which you
broke. Then you are to put them in the
chest."
3So I made the ark out of acacia wood
and chiseled out two stone tablets like
the first ones, and I went up on the
mountain with the two tablets in my
hands.
4The Lord wrote on these tablets what
he had written before, the Ten
Commandments he had proclaimed to
you on the mountain, out of the fire, on
the day of the assembly. And the Lord
gave them to me.
5Then I came back down the mountain
and put the tablets in the ark I had made,
as the Lord commanded me, and they
are there now.
6(The Israelites traveled from the wells
of the Jaakanites to Moserah. There
Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar
his son succeeded him as priest.
7From there they traveled to Gudgodah
and on to Jotbathah, a land with
streams of water.
8At that time the Lord set apart the tribe
of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant
of the Lord , to stand before the Lord to
minister and to pronounce blessings in
his name, as they still do today.
9That is why the Levites have no share
or inheritance among their brothers; the
Lord is their inheritance, as the Lord
your God told them.)
10Now I had stayed on the mountain
forty days and nights, as I did the first
time, and the Lord listened to me at this
time also. It was not his will to destroy
you.
11"Go," the Lord said to me, "and lead
the people on their way, so that they
may enter and possess the land that I
swore to their fathers to give them."
12And now, O Israel, what does the Lord
your God ask of you but to fear the Lord
your God, to walk in all his ways, to love
him, to serve the Lord your God with all
your heart and with all your soul,
13and to observe the Lord 's commands
and decrees that I am giving you today
for your own good?
14To the Lord your God belong the
heavens, even the highest heavens, the
earth and everything in it.
15Yet the Lord set his affection on your
forefathers and loved them, and he
chose you, their descendants, above all
the nations, as it is today.
16Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and
do not be stiff-necked any longer.
17For the Lord your God is God of gods
and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty
and awesome, who shows no partiality
and accepts no bribes.
18He defends the cause of the fatherless
and the widow, and loves the alien,
giving him food and clothing.
19And you are to love those who are
aliens, for you yourselves were aliens in
Egypt.
20Fear the Lord your God and serve him.
Hold fast to him and take your oaths in
his name.
21He is your praise; he is your God, who
performed for you those great and
awesome wonders you saw with your
own eyes.
22Your forefathers who went down into
Egypt were seventy in all, and now the
Lord your God has made you as
numerous as the stars in the sky.
11Love the Lord your God and keep
his requirements, his decrees, his laws
and his commands always.
2Remember today that your children
were not the ones who saw and
experienced the discipline of the Lord
your God: his majesty, his mighty hand,
his outstretched arm;
3the signs he performed and the things
he did in the heart of Egypt, both to
Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his whole
country;
4what he did to the Egyptian army, to its
horses and chariots, how he
overwhelmed them with the waters of
the Red Sea as they were pursuing you,
and how the Lord brought lasting ruin on
them.
5It was not your children who saw what
he did for you in the desert until you
arrived at this place,
6and what he did to Dathan and Abiram,
sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when the
earth opened its mouth right in the
middle of all Israel and swallowed them
up with their households, their tents and
every living thing that belonged to them.
7But it was your own eyes that saw all
these great things the Lord has done.
8Observe therefore all the commands I
am giving you today, so that you may
have the strength to go in and take over
the land that you are crossing the
Jordan to possess,
9and so that you may live long in the
land that the Lord swore to your
forefathers to give to them and their
descendants, a land flowing with milk
and honey.
10The land you are entering to take over
is not like the land of Egypt, from which
you have come, where you planted your
seed and irrigated it by foot as in a
vegetable garden.
11But the land you are crossing the
Jordan to take possession of is a land of
mountains and valleys that drinks rain
from heaven.
12It is a land the Lord your God cares
for; the eyes of the Lord your God are
continually on it from the beginning of
the year to its end.
13So if you faithfully obey the commands
I am giving you today-to love the Lord
your God and to serve him with all your
heart and with all your soul-
14then I will send rain on your land in its
season, both autumn and spring rains,
so that you may gather in your grain,
new wine and oil.
15I will provide grass in the fields for your
cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied.
16Be careful, or you will be enticed to
turn away and worship other gods and
bow down to them.
17Then the Lord 's anger will burn
against you, and he will shut the
heavens so that it will not rain and the
ground will yield no produce, and you
will soon perish from the good land the
Lord is giving you.
18Fix these words of mine in your hearts
and minds; tie them as symbols on your
hands and bind them on your foreheads.
19Teach them to your children, talking
about them when you sit at home and
when you walk along the road, when
you lie down and when you get up.
20Write them on the doorframes of your
houses and on your gates,
21so that your days and the days of your
children may be many in the land that
the Lord swore to give your forefathers,
as many as the days that the heavens
are above the earth.
22If you carefully observe all these
commands I am giving you to follow-to
love the Lord your God, to walk in all his
ways and to hold fast to him-
23then the Lord will drive out all these
nations before you, and you will
dispossess nations larger and stronger
than you.
24Every place where you set your foot
will be yours: Your territory will extend
from the desert to Lebanon, and from
the Euphrates River to the western sea.
25No man will be able to stand against
you. The Lord your God, as he promised
you, will put the terror and fear of you on
the whole land, wherever you go.
26See, I am setting before you today a
blessing and a curse-
27the blessing if you obey the
commands of the Lord your God that I
am giving you today;
28the curse if you disobey the
commands of the Lord your God and
turn from the way that I command you
today by following other gods, which you
have not known.
29When the Lord your God has brought
you into the land you are entering to
possess, you are to proclaim on Mount
Gerizim the blessings, and on Mount
Ebal the curses.
30As you know, these mountains are
across the Jordan, west of the road,
toward the setting sun, near the great
trees of Moreh, in the territory of those
Canaanites living in the Arabah in the
vicinity of Gilgal.
31You are about to cross the Jordan to
enter and take possession of the land
the Lord your God is giving you. When
you have taken it over and are living
there,
32be sure that you obey all the decrees
and laws I am setting before you today.
12These are the decrees and laws
you must be careful to follow in the land
that the Lord , the God of your fathers,
has given you to possess-as long as
you live in the land.
2Destroy completely all the places on
the high mountains and on the hills and
under every spreading tree where the
nations you are dispossessing worship
their gods.
3Break down their altars, smash their
sacred stones and burn their Asherah
poles in the fire; cut down the idols of
their gods and wipe out their names
from those places.
4You must not worship the Lord your
God in their way.
5But you are to seek the place the Lord
your God will choose from among all
your tribes to put his Name there for his
dwelling. To that place you must go;
6there bring your burnt offerings and
sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts,
what you have vowed to give and your
freewill offerings, and the firstborn of
your herds and flocks.
7There, in the presence of the Lord your
God, you and your families shall eat and
shall rejoice in everything you have put
your hand to, because the Lord your
God has blessed you.
8You are not to do as we do here today,
everyone as he sees fit,
9since you have not yet reached the
resting place and the inheritance the
Lord your God is giving you.
10But you will cross the Jordan and
settle in the land the Lord your God is
giving you as an inheritance, and he will
give you rest from all your enemies
around you so that you will live in safety.
11Then to the place the Lord your God
will choose as a dwelling for his Namethere
you are to bring everything I
command you: your burnt offerings and
sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts,
and all the choice possessions you have
vowed to the Lord .
12And there rejoice before the Lord your
God, you, your sons and daughters,
your menservants and maidservants,
and the Levites from your towns, who
have no allotment or inheritance of their
own.
13Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt
offerings anywhere you please.
14Offer them only at the place the Lord
will choose in one of your tribes, and
there observe everything I command
you.
15Nevertheless, you may slaughter your
animals in any of your towns and eat as
much of the meat as you want, as if it
were gazelle or deer, according to the
blessing the Lord your God gives you.
Both the ceremonially unclean and the
clean may eat it.
16But you must not eat the blood; pour it
out on the ground like water.
17You must not eat in your own towns
the tithe of your grain and new wine and
oil, or the firstborn of your herds and
flocks, or whatever you have vowed to
give, or your freewill offerings or special
gifts.
18Instead, you are to eat them in the
presence of the Lord your God at the
place the Lord your God will choose-you,
your sons and daughters, your
menservants and maidservants, and the
Levites from your towns-and you are to
rejoice before the Lord your God in
everything you put your hand to.
19Be careful not to neglect the Levites as
long as you live in your land.
20When the Lord your God has enlarged
your territory as he promised you, and
you crave meat and say, "I would like
some meat," then you may eat as much
of it as you want.
21If the place where the Lord your God
chooses to put his Name is too far away
from you, you may slaughter animals
from the herds and flocks the Lord has
given you, as I have commanded you,
and in your own towns you may eat as
much of them as you want.
22Eat them as you would gazelle or deer.
Both the ceremonially unclean and the
clean may eat.
23But be sure you do not eat the blood,
because the blood is the life, and you
must not eat the life with the meat.
24You must not eat the blood; pour it out
on the ground like water.
25Do not eat it, so that it may go well
with you and your children after you,
because you will be doing what is right
in the eyes of the Lord .
26But take your consecrated things and
whatever you have vowed to give, and
go to the place the Lord will choose.
27Present your burnt offerings on the
altar of the Lord your God, both the
meat and the blood. The blood of your
sacrifices must be poured beside the
altar of the Lord your God, but you may
eat the meat.
28Be careful to obey all these regulations
I am giving you, so that it may always go
well with you and your children after you,
because you will be doing what is good
and right in the eyes of the Lord your
God.
29The Lord your God will cut off before
you the nations you are about to invade
and dispossess. But when you have
driven them out and settled in their land,
30and after they have been destroyed
before you, be careful not to be
ensnared by inquiring about their gods,
saying, "How do these nations serve
their gods? We will do the same."
31You must not worship the Lord your
God in their way, because in worshiping
their gods, they do all kinds of
detestable things the Lord hates. They
even burn their sons and daughters in
the fire as sacrifices to their gods.
32See that you do all I command you; do
not add to it or take away from it.
13If a prophet, or one who foretells
by dreams, appears among you and
announces to you a miraculous sign or
wonder,
2and if the sign or wonder of which he
has spoken takes place, and he says,
"Let us follow other gods" (gods you
have not known) "and let us worship
them,"
3you must not listen to the words of that
prophet or dreamer. The Lord your God
is testing you to find out whether you
love him with all your heart and with all
your soul.
4It is the Lord your God you must follow,
and him you must revere. Keep his
commands and obey him; serve him
and hold fast to him.
5That prophet or dreamer must be put to
death, because he preached rebellion
against the Lord your God, who brought
you out of Egypt and redeemed you
from the land of slavery; he has tried to
turn you from the way the Lord your God
commanded you to follow. You must
purge the evil from among you.
6If your very own brother, or your son or
daughter, or the wife you love, or your
closest friend secretly entices you,
saying, "Let us go and worship other
gods" (gods that neither you nor your
fathers have known,
7gods of the peoples around you,
whether near or far, from one end of the
land to the other),
8do not yield to him or listen to him.
Show him no pity. Do not spare him or
shield him.
9You must certainly put him to death.
Your hand must be the first in putting
him to death, and then the hands of all
the people.
10Stone him to death, because he tried
to turn you away from the Lord your God,
who brought you out of Egypt, out of the
land of slavery.
11Then all Israel will hear and be afraid,
and no one among you will do such an
evil thing again.
12If you hear it said about one of the
towns the Lord your God is giving you to
live in
13that wicked men have arisen among
you and have led the people of their
town astray, saying, "Let us go and
worship other gods" (gods you have not
known),
14then you must inquire, probe and
investigate it thoroughly. And if it is true
and it has been proved that this
detestable thing has been done among
you,
15you must certainly put to the sword all
who live in that town. Destroy it
completely, both its people and its
livestock.
16Gather all the plunder of the town into
the middle of the public square and
completely burn the town and all its
plunder as a whole burnt offering to the
Lord your God. It is to remain a ruin
forever, never to be rebuilt.
17None of those condemned things shall
be found in your hands, so that the Lord
will turn from his fierce anger; he will
show you mercy, have compassion on
you, and increase your numbers, as he
promised on oath to your forefathers,
18because you obey the Lord your God,
keeping all his commands that I am
giving you today and doing what is right
in his eyes.
14You are the children of the Lord
your God. Do not cut yourselves or
shave the front of your heads for the
dead,
2for you are a people holy to the Lord
your God. Out of all the peoples on the
face of the earth, the Lord has chosen
you to be his treasured possession.
3Do not eat any detestable thing.
4These are the animals you may eat: the
ox, the sheep, the goat,
5the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the
wild goat, the ibex, the antelope and the
mountain sheep.
6You may eat any animal that has a split
hoof divided in two and that chews the
cud.
7However, of those that chew the cud or
that have a split hoof completely divided
you may not eat the camel, the rabbit or
the coney. Although they chew the cud,
they do not have a split hoof; they are
ceremonially unclean for you.
8The pig is also unclean; although it has
a split hoof, it does not chew the cud.
You are not to eat their meat or touch
their carcasses.
9Of all the creatures living in the water,
you may eat any that has fins and
scales.
10But anything that does not have fins
and scales you may not eat; for you it is
unclean.
11You may eat any clean bird.
12But these you may not eat: the eagle,
the vulture, the black vulture,
13the red kite, the black kite, any kind of
falcon,
14any kind of raven,
15the horned owl, the screech owl, the
gull, any kind of hawk,
16the little owl, the great owl, the white
owl,
17the desert owl, the osprey, the
cormorant,
18the stork, any kind of heron, the
hoopoe and the bat.
19All flying insects that swarm are
unclean to you; do not eat them.
20But any winged creature that is clean
you may eat.
21Do not eat anything you find already
dead. You may give it to an alien living
in any of your towns, and he may eat it,
or you may sell it to a foreigner. But you
are a people holy to the Lord your God.
Do not cook a young goat in its mother's
milk.
22Be sure to set aside a tenth of all that
your fields produce each year.
23Eat the tithe of your grain, new wine
and oil, and the firstborn of your herds
and flocks in the presence of the Lord
your God at the place he will choose as
a dwelling for his Name, so that you
may learn to revere the Lord your God
always.
24But if that place is too distant and you
have been blessed by the Lord your
God and cannot carry your tithe
(because the place where the Lord will
choose to put his Name is so far away),
25then exchange your tithe for silver, and
take the silver with you and go to the
place the Lord your God will choose.
26Use the silver to buy whatever you
like: cattle, sheep, wine or other
fermented drink, or anything you wish.
Then you and your household shall eat
there in the presence of the Lord your
God and rejoice.
27And do not neglect the Levites living in
your towns, for they have no allotment
or inheritance of their own.
28At the end of every three years, bring
all the tithes of that year's produce and
store it in your towns,
29so that the Levites (who have no
allotment or inheritance of their own)
and the aliens, the fatherless and the
widows who live in your towns may
come and eat and be satisfied, and so
that the Lord your God may bless you in
all the work of your hands.
15At the end of every seven years
you must cancel debts.
2This is how it is to be done: Every
creditor shall cancel the loan he has
made to his fellow Israelite. He shall not
require payment from his fellow Israelite
or brother, because the Lord 's time for
canceling debts has been proclaimed.
3You may require payment from a
foreigner, but you must cancel any debt
your brother owes you.
4However, there should be no poor
among you, for in the land the Lord your
God is giving you to possess as your
inheritance, he will richly bless you,
5if only you fully obey the Lord your God
and are careful to follow all these
commands I am giving you today.
6For the Lord your God will bless you as
he has promised, and you will lend to
many nations but will borrow from none.
You will rule over many nations but
none will rule over you.
7If there is a poor man among your
brothers in any of the towns of the land
that the Lord your God is giving you, do
not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward
your poor brother.
8Rather be openhanded and freely lend
him whatever he needs.
9Be careful not to harbor this wicked
thought: "The seventh year, the year for
canceling debts, is near," so that you do
not show ill will toward your needy
brother and give him nothing. He may
then appeal to the Lord against you, and
you will be found guilty of sin.
10Give generously to him and do so
without a grudging heart; then because
of this the Lord your God will bless you
in all your work and in everything you
put your hand to.
11There will always be poor people in
the land. Therefore I command you to
be openhanded toward your brothers
and toward the poor and needy in your
land.
12If a fellow Hebrew, a man or a woman,
sells himself to you and serves you six
years, in the seventh year you must let
him go free.
13And when you release him, do not
send him away empty-handed.
14Supply him liberally from your flock,
your threshing floor and your winepress.
Give to him as the Lord your God has
blessed you.
15Remember that you were slaves in
Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed
you. That is why I give you this
command today.
16But if your servant says to you, "I do
not want to leave you," because he
loves you and your family and is well off
with you,
17then take an awl and push it through
his ear lobe into the door, and he will
become your servant for life. Do the
same for your maidservant.
18Do not consider it a hardship to set
your servant free, because his service to
you these six years has been worth
twice as much as that of a hired hand.
And the Lord your God will bless you in
everything you do.
19Set apart for the Lord your God every
firstborn male of your herds and flocks.
Do not put the firstborn of your oxen to
work, and do not shear the firstborn of
your sheep.
20Each year you and your family are to
eat them in the presence of the Lord
your God at the place he will choose.
21If an animal has a defect, is lame or
blind, or has any serious flaw, you must
not sacrifice it to the Lord your God.
22You are to eat it in your own towns.
Both the ceremonially unclean and the
clean may eat it, as if it were gazelle or
deer.
23But you must not eat the blood; pour it
out on the ground like water.
16Observe the month of Abib and
celebrate the Passover of the Lord your
God, because in the month of Abib he
brought you out of Egypt by night.
2Sacrifice as the Passover to the Lord
your God an animal from your flock or
herd at the place the Lord will choose as
a dwelling for his Name.
3Do not eat it with bread made with
yeast, but for seven days eat
unleavened bread, the bread of affliction,
because you left Egypt in haste-so that
all the days of your life you may
remember the time of your departure
from Egypt.
4Let no yeast be found in your
possession in all your land for seven
days. Do not let any of the meat you
sacrifice on the evening of the first day
remain until morning.
5You must not sacrifice the Passover in
any town the Lord your God gives you
6except in the place he will choose as a
dwelling for his Name. There you must
sacrifice the Passover in the evening,
when the sun goes down, on the
anniversary of your departure from
Egypt.
7Roast it and eat it at the place the Lord
your God will choose. Then in the
morning return to your tents.
8For six days eat unleavened bread and
on the seventh day hold an assembly to
the Lord your God and do no work.
9Count off seven weeks from the time
you begin to put the sickle to the
standing grain.
10Then celebrate the Feast of Weeks to
the Lord your God by giving a freewill
offering in proportion to the blessings
the Lord your God has given you.
11And rejoice before the Lord your God
at the place he will choose as a dwelling
for his Name-you, your sons and
daughters, your menservants and
maidservants, the Levites in your towns,
and the aliens, the fatherless and the
widows living among you.
12Remember that you were slaves in
Egypt, and follow carefully these
decrees.
13Celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles for
seven days after you have gathered the
produce of your threshing floor and your
winepress.
14Be joyful at your Feast-you, your sons
and daughters, your menservants and
maidservants, and the Levites, the
aliens, the fatherless and the widows
who live in your towns.
15For seven days celebrate the Feast to
the Lord your God at the place the Lord
will choose. For the Lord your God will
bless you in all your harvest and in all
the work of your hands, and your joy will
be complete.
16Three times a year all your men must
appear before the Lord your God at the
place he will choose: at the Feast of
Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks
and the Feast of Tabernacles. No man
should appear before the Lord emptyhanded:
17Each of you must bring a gift in
proportion to the way the Lord your God
has blessed you.
18Appoint judges and officials for each of
your tribes in every town the Lord your
God is giving you, and they shall judge
the people fairly.
19Do not pervert justice or show partiality.
Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds
the eyes of the wise and twists the
words of the righteous.
20Follow justice and justice alone, so
that you may live and possess the land
the Lord your God is giving you.
21Do not set up any wooden Asherah
pole beside the altar you build to the
Lord your God,
22and do not erect a sacred stone, for
these the Lord your God hates.
17Do not sacrifice to the Lord your
God an ox or a sheep that has any
defect or flaw in it, for that would be
detestable to him.
2If a man or woman living among you in
one of the towns the Lord gives you is
found doing evil in the eyes of the Lord
your God in violation of his covenant,
3and contrary to my command has
worshiped other gods, bowing down to
them or to the sun or the moon or the
stars of the sky,
4and this has been brought to your
attention, then you must investigate it
thoroughly. If it is true and it has been
proved that this detestable thing has
been done in Israel,
5take the man or woman who has done
this evil deed to your city gate and stone
that person to death.
6On the testimony of two or three
witnesses a man shall be put to death,
but no one shall be put to death on the
testimony of only one witness.
7The hands of the witnesses must be
the first in putting him to death, and then
the hands of all the people. You must
purge the evil from among you.
8If cases come before your courts that
are too difficult for you to judge-whether
bloodshed, lawsuits or assaults-take
them to the place the Lord your God will
choose.
9Go to the priests, who are Levites, and
to the judge who is in office at that time.
Inquire of them and they will give you
the verdict.
10You must act according to the
decisions they give you at the place the
Lord will choose. Be careful to do
everything they direct you to do.
11Act according to the law they teach
you and the decisions they give you. Do
not turn aside from what they tell you, to
the right or to the left.
12The man who shows contempt for the
judge or for the priest who stands
ministering there to the Lord your God
must be put to death. You must purge
the evil from Israel.
13All the people will hear and be afraid,
and will not be contemptuous again.
14When you enter the land the Lord your
God is giving you and have taken
possession of it and settled in it, and
you say, "Let us set a king over us like
all the nations around us,"
15be sure to appoint over you the king
the Lord your God chooses. He must be
from among your own brothers. Do not
place a foreigner over you, one who is
not a brother Israelite.
16The king, moreover, must not acquire
great numbers of horses for himself or
make the people return to Egypt to get
more of them, for the Lord has told you,
"You are not to go back that way again."
17He must not take many wives, or his
heart will be led astray. He must not
accumulate large amounts of silver and
gold.
18When he takes the throne of his
kingdom, he is to write for himself on a
scroll a copy of this law, taken from that
of the priests, who are Levites.
19It is to be with him, and he is to read it
all the days of his life so that he may
learn to revere the Lord his God and
follow carefully all the words of this law
and these decrees
20and not consider himself better than
his brothers and turn from the law to the
right or to the left. Then he and his
descendants will reign a long time over
his kingdom in Israel.
18The priests, who are Levitesindeed
the whole tribe of Levi-are to
have no allotment or inheritance with
Israel. They shall live on the offerings
made to the Lord by fire, for that is their
inheritance.
2They shall have no inheritance among
their brothers; the Lord is their
inheritance, as he promised them.
3This is the share due the priests from
the people who sacrifice a bull or a
sheep: the shoulder, the jowls and the
inner parts.
4You are to give them the firstfruits of
your grain, new wine and oil, and the
first wool from the shearing of your
sheep,
5for the Lord your God has chosen them
and their descendants out of all your
tribes to stand and minister in the Lord 's
name always.
6If a Levite moves from one of your
towns anywhere in Israel where he is
living, and comes in all earnestness to
the place the Lord will choose,
7he may minister in the name of the Lord
his God like all his fellow Levites who
serve there in the presence of the Lord .
8He is to share equally in their benefits,
even though he has received money
from the sale of family possessions.
9When you enter the land the Lord your
God is giving you, do not learn to imitate
the detestable ways of the nations there.
10Let no one be found among you who
sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire,
who practices divination or sorcery,
interprets omens, engages in witchcraft,
11or casts spells, or who is a medium or
spiritist or who consults the dead.
12Anyone who does these things is
detestable to the Lord , and because of
these detestable practices the Lord your
God will drive out those nations before
you.
13You must be blameless before the
Lord your God.
14The nations you will dispossess listen
to those who practice sorcery or
divination. But as for you, the Lord your
God has not permitted you to do so.
15The Lord your God will raise up for you
a prophet like me from among your own
brothers. You must listen to him.
16For this is what you asked of the Lord
your God at Horeb on the day of the
assembly when you said, "Let us not
hear the voice of the Lord our God nor
see this great fire anymore, or we will
die."
17The Lord said to me: "What they say is
good.
18I will raise up for them a prophet like
you from among their brothers; I will put
my words in his mouth, and he will tell
them everything I command him.
19If anyone does not listen to my words
that the prophet speaks in my name, I
myself will call him to account.
20But a prophet who presumes to speak
in my name anything I have not
commanded him to say, or a prophet
who speaks in the name of other gods,
must be put to death."
21You may say to yourselves, "How can
we know when a message has not been
spoken by the Lord ?"
22If what a prophet proclaims in the
name of the Lord does not take place or
come true, that is a message the Lord
has not spoken. That prophet has
spoken presumptuously. Do not be
afraid of him.
19When the Lord your God has
destroyed the nations whose land he is
giving you, and when you have driven
them out and settled in their towns and
houses,
2then set aside for yourselves three
cities centrally located in the land the
Lord your God is giving you to possess.
3Build roads to them and divide into
three parts the land the Lord your God is
giving you as an inheritance, so that
anyone who kills a man may flee there.
4This is the rule concerning the man
who kills another and flees there to save
his life-one who kills his neighbor
unintentionally, without malice
aforethought.
5For instance, a man may go into the
forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and
as he swings his ax to fell a tree, the
head may fly off and hit his neighbor
and kill him. That man may flee to one
of these cities and save his life.
6Otherwise, the avenger of blood might
pursue him in a rage, overtake him if the
distance is too great, and kill him even
though he is not deserving of death,
since he did it to his neighbor without
malice aforethought.
7This is why I command you to set aside
for yourselves three cities.
8If the Lord your God enlarges your
territory, as he promised on oath to your
forefathers, and gives you the whole
land he promised them,
9because you carefully follow all these
laws I command you today-to love the
Lord your God and to walk always in his
ways-then you are to set aside three
more cities.
10Do this so that innocent blood will not
be shed in your land, which the Lord
your God is giving you as your
inheritance, and so that you will not be
guilty of bloodshed.
11But if a man hates his neighbor and
lies in wait for him, assaults and kills him,
and then flees to one of these cities,
12the elders of his town shall send for
him, bring him back from the city, and
hand him over to the avenger of blood to
die.
13Show him no pity. You must purge
from Israel the guilt of shedding
innocent blood, so that it may go well
with you.
14Do not move your neighbor's boundary
stone set up by your predecessors in
the inheritance you receive in the land
the Lord your God is giving you to
possess.
15One witness is not enough to convict a
man accused of any crime or offense he
may have committed. A matter must be
established by the testimony of two or
three witnesses.
16If a malicious witness takes the stand
to accuse a man of a crime,
17the two men involved in the dispute
must stand in the presence of the Lord
before the priests and the judges who
are in office at the time.
18The judges must make a thorough
investigation, and if the witness proves
to be a liar, giving false testimony
against his brother,
19then do to him as he intended to do to
his brother. You must purge the evil
from among you.
20The rest of the people will hear of this
and be afraid, and never again will such
an evil thing be done among you.
21Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye,
tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for
foot.
20When you go to war against your
enemies and see horses and chariots
and an army greater than yours, do not
be afraid of them, because the Lord
your God, who brought you up out of
Egypt, will be with you.
2When you are about to go into battle,
the priest shall come forward and
address the army.
3He shall say: "Hear, O Israel, today you
are going into battle against your
enemies. Do not be fainthearted or
afraid; do not be terrified or give way to
panic before them.
4For the Lord your God is the one who
goes with you to fight for you against
your enemies to give you victory."
5The officers shall say to the army: "Has
anyone built a new house and not
dedicated it? Let him go home, or he
may die in battle and someone else may
dedicate it.
6Has anyone planted a vineyard and not
begun to enjoy it? Let him go home, or
he may die in battle and someone else
enjoy it.
7Has anyone become pledged to a
woman and not married her? Let him go
home, or he may die in battle and
someone else marry her."
8Then the officers shall add, "Is any man
afraid or fainthearted? Let him go home
so that his brothers will not become
disheartened too."
9When the officers have finished
speaking to the army, they shall appoint
commanders over it.
10When you march up to attack a city,
make its people an offer of peace.
11If they accept and open their gates, all
the people in it shall be subject to forced
labor and shall work for you.
12If they refuse to make peace and they
engage you in battle, lay siege to that
city.
13When the Lord your God delivers it
into your hand, put to the sword all the
men in it.
14As for the women, the children, the
livestock and everything else in the city,
you may take these as plunder for
yourselves. And you may use the
plunder the Lord your God gives you
from your enemies.
15This is how you are to treat all the
cities that are at a distance from you
and do not belong to the nations nearby.
16However, in the cities of the nations
the Lord your God is giving you as an
inheritance, do not leave alive anything
that breathes.
17Completely destroy them-the Hittites,
Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites,
Hivites and Jebusites-as the Lord your
God has commanded you.
18Otherwise, they will teach you to follow
all the detestable things they do in
worshiping their gods, and you will sin
against the Lord your God.
19When you lay siege to a city for a long
time, fighting against it to capture it, do
not destroy its trees by putting an ax to
them, because you can eat their fruit.
Do not cut them down. Are the trees of
the field people, that you should besiege
them?
20However, you may cut down trees that
you know are not fruit trees and use
them to build siege works until the city at
war with you falls.
21If a man is found slain, lying in a
field in the land the Lord your God is
giving you to possess, and it is not
known who killed him,
2your elders and judges shall go out and
measure the distance from the body to
the neighboring towns.
3Then the elders of the town nearest the
body shall take a heifer that has never
been worked and has never worn a
yoke
4and lead her down to a valley that has
not been plowed or planted and where
there is a flowing stream. There in the
valley they are to break the heifer's neck.
5The priests, the sons of Levi, shall step
forward, for the Lord your God has
chosen them to minister and to
pronounce blessings in the name of the
Lord and to decide all cases of dispute
and assault.
6Then all the elders of the town nearest
the body shall wash their hands over the
heifer whose neck was broken in the
valley,
7and they shall declare: "Our hands did
not shed this blood, nor did our eyes
see it done.
8Accept this atonement for your people
Israel, whom you have redeemed, O
Lord , and do not hold your people guilty
of the blood of an innocent man." And
the bloodshed will be atoned for.
9So you will purge from yourselves the
guilt of shedding innocent blood, since
you have done what is right in the eyes
of the Lord .
10When you go to war against your
enemies and the Lord your God delivers
them into your hands and you take
captives,
11if you notice among the captives a
beautiful woman and are attracted to her,
you may take her as your wife.
12Bring her into your home and have her
shave her head, trim her nails
13and put aside the clothes she was
wearing when captured. After she has
lived in your house and mourned her
father and mother for a full month, then
you may go to her and be her husband
and she shall be your wife.
14If you are not pleased with her, let her
go wherever she wishes. You must not
sell her or treat her as a slave, since you
have dishonored her.
15If a man has two wives, and he loves
one but not the other, and both bear him
sons but the firstborn is the son of the
wife he does not love,
16when he wills his property to his sons,
he must not give the rights of the
firstborn to the son of the wife he loves
in preference to his actual firstborn, the
son of the wife he does not love.
17He must acknowledge the son of his
unloved wife as the firstborn by giving
him a double share of all he has. That
son is the first sign of his father's
strength. The right of the firstborn
belongs to him.
18If a man has a stubborn and rebellious
son who does not obey his father and
mother and will not listen to them when
they discipline him,
19his father and mother shall take hold of
him and bring him to the elders at the
gate of his town.
20They shall say to the elders, "This son
of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He
will not obey us. He is a profligate and a
drunkard."
21Then all the men of his town shall
stone him to death. You must purge the
evil from among you. All Israel will hear
of it and be afraid.
22If a man guilty of a capital offense is
put to death and his body is hung on a
tree,
23you must not leave his body on the
tree overnight. Be sure to bury him that
same day, because anyone who is hung
on a tree is under God's curse. You
must not desecrate the land the Lord
your God is giving you as an inheritance.
22If you see your brother's ox or
sheep straying, do not ignore it but be
sure to take it back to him.
2If the brother does not live near you or
if you do not know who he is, take it
home with you and keep it until he
comes looking for it. Then give it back to
him.
3Do the same if you find your brother's
donkey or his cloak or anything he loses.
Do not ignore it.
4If you see your brother's donkey or his
ox fallen on the road, do not ignore it.
Help him get it to its feet.
5A woman must not wear men's clothing,
nor a man wear women's clothing, for
the Lord your God detests anyone who
does this.
6If you come across a bird's nest beside
the road, either in a tree or on the
ground, and the mother is sitting on the
young or on the eggs, do not take the
mother with the young.
7You may take the young, but be sure to
let the mother go, so that it may go well
with you and you may have a long life.
8When you build a new house, make a
parapet around your roof so that you
may not bring the guilt of bloodshed on
your house if someone falls from the
roof.
9Do not plant two kinds of seed in your
vineyard; if you do, not only the crops
you plant but also the fruit of the
vineyard will be defiled.
10Do not plow with an ox and a donkey
yoked together.
11Do not wear clothes of wool and linen
woven together.
12Make tassels on the four corners of
the cloak you wear.
13If a man takes a wife and, after lying
with her, dislikes her
14and slanders her and gives her a bad
name, saying, "I married this woman,
but when I approached her, I did not find
proof of her virginity,"
15then the girl's father and mother shall
bring proof that she was a virgin to the
town elders at the gate.
16The girl's father will say to the elders,
"I gave my daughter in marriage to this
man, but he dislikes her.
17Now he has slandered her and said, 'I
did not find your daughter to be a virgin.'
But here is the proof of my daughter's
virginity." Then her parents shall display
the cloth before the elders of the town,
18and the elders shall take the man and
punish him.
19They shall fine him a hundred shekels
of silver and give them to the girl's father,
because this man has given an Israelite
virgin a bad name. She shall continue to
be his wife; he must not divorce her as
long as he lives.
20If, however, the charge is true and no
proof of the girl's virginity can be found,
21she shall be brought to the door of her
father's house and there the men of her
town shall stone her to death. She has
done a disgraceful thing in Israel by
being promiscuous while still in her
father's house. You must purge the evil
from among you.
22If a man is found sleeping with another
man's wife, both the man who slept with
her and the woman must die. You must
purge the evil from Israel.
23If a man happens to meet in a town a
virgin pledged to be married and he
sleeps with her,
24you shall take both of them to the gate
of that town and stone them to death-the
girl because she was in a town and did
not scream for help, and the man
because he violated another man's wife.
You must purge the evil from among
you.
25But if out in the country a man
happens to meet a girl pledged to be
married and rapes her, only the man
who has done this shall die.
26Do nothing to the girl; she has
committed no sin deserving death. This
case is like that of someone who attacks
and murders his neighbor,
27for the man found the girl out in the
country, and though the betrothed girl
screamed, there was no one to rescue
her.
28If a man happens to meet a virgin who
is not pledged to be married and rapes
her and they are discovered,
29he shall pay the girl's father fifty
shekels of silver. He must marry the girl,
for he has violated her. He can never
divorce her as long as he lives.
30A man is not to marry his father's wife;
he must not dishonor his father's bed.
23No one who has been
emasculated by crushing or cutting may
enter the assembly of the Lord .
2No one born of a forbidden marriage
nor any of his descendants may enter
the assembly of the Lord , even down to
the tenth generation.
3No Ammonite or Moabite or any of his
descendants may enter the assembly of
the Lord , even down to the tenth
generation.
4For they did not come to meet you with
bread and water on your way when you
came out of Egypt, and they hired
Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in
Aram Naharaim to pronounce a curse
on you.
5However, the Lord your God would not
listen to Balaam but turned the curse
into a blessing for you, because the
Lord your God loves you.
6Do not seek a treaty of friendship with
them as long as you live.
7Do not abhor an Edomite, for he is your
brother. Do not abhor an Egyptian,
because you lived as an alien in his
country.
8The third generation of children born to
them may enter the assembly of the
Lord .
9When you are encamped against your
enemies, keep away from everything
impure.
10If one of your men is unclean because
of a nocturnal emission, he is to go
outside the camp and stay there.
11But as evening approaches he is to
wash himself, and at sunset he may
return to the camp.
12Designate a place outside the camp
where you can go to relieve yourself.
13As part of your equipment have
something to dig with, and when you
relieve yourself, dig a hole and cover up
your excrement.
14For the Lord your God moves about in
your camp to protect you and to deliver
your enemies to you. Your camp must
be holy, so that he will not see among
you anything indecent and turn away
from you.
15If a slave has taken refuge with you,
do not hand him over to his master.
16Let him live among you wherever he
likes and in whatever town he chooses.
Do not oppress him.
17No Israelite man or woman is to
become a shrine prostitute.
18You must not bring the earnings of a
female prostitute or of a male prostitute
into the house of the Lord your God to
pay any vow, because the Lord your
God detests them both.
19Do not charge your brother interest,
whether on money or food or anything
else that may earn interest.
20You may charge a foreigner interest,
but not a brother Israelite, so that the
Lord your God may bless you in
everything you put your hand to in the
land you are entering to possess.
21If you make a vow to the Lord your
God, do not be slow to pay it, for the
Lord your God will certainly demand it of
you and you will be guilty of sin.
22But if you refrain from making a vow,
you will not be guilty.
23Whatever your lips utter you must be
sure to do, because you made your vow
freely to the Lord your God with your
own mouth.
24If you enter your neighbor's vineyard,
you may eat all the grapes you want, but
do not put any in your basket.
25If you enter your neighbor's grainfield,
you may pick kernels with your hands,
but you must not put a sickle to his
standing grain.
24If a man marries a woman who
becomes displeasing to him because he
finds something indecent about her, and
he writes her a certificate of divorce,
gives it to her and sends her from his
house,
2and if after she leaves his house she
becomes the wife of another man,
3and her second husband dislikes her
and writes her a certificate of divorce,
gives it to her and sends her from his
house, or if he dies,
4then her first husband, who divorced
her, is not allowed to marry her again
after she has been defiled. That would
be detestable in the eyes of the Lord .
Do not bring sin upon the land the Lord
your God is giving you as an inheritance.
5If a man has recently married, he must
not be sent to war or have any other
duty laid on him. For one year he is to
be free to stay at home and bring
happiness to the wife he has married.
6Do not take a pair of millstones-not
even the upper one-as security for a
debt, because that would be taking a
man's livelihood as security.
7If a man is caught kidnapping one of his
brother Israelites and treats him as a
slave or sells him, the kidnapper must
die. You must purge the evil from
among you.
8In cases of leprous diseases be very
careful to do exactly as the priests, who
are Levites, instruct you. You must
follow carefully what I have commanded
them.
9Remember what the Lord your God did
to Miriam along the way after you came
out of Egypt.
10When you make a loan of any kind to
your neighbor, do not go into his house
to get what he is offering as a pledge.
11Stay outside and let the man to whom
you are making the loan bring the
pledge out to you.
12If the man is poor, do not go to sleep
with his pledge in your possession.
13Return his cloak to him by sunset so
that he may sleep in it. Then he will
thank you, and it will be regarded as a
righteous act in the sight of the Lord
your God.
14Do not take advantage of a hired man
who is poor and needy, whether he is a
brother Israelite or an alien living in one
of your towns.
15Pay him his wages each day before
sunset, because he is poor and is
counting on it. Otherwise he may cry to
the Lord against you, and you will be
guilty of sin.
16Fathers shall not be put to death for
their children, nor children put to death
for their fathers; each is to die for his
own sin.
17Do not deprive the alien or the
fatherless of justice, or take the cloak of
the widow as a pledge.
18Remember that you were slaves in
Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed
you from there. That is why I command
you to do this.
19When you are harvesting in your field
and you overlook a sheaf, do not go
back to get it. Leave it for the alien, the
fatherless and the widow, so that the
Lord your God may bless you in all the
work of your hands.
20When you beat the olives from your
trees, do not go over the branches a
second time. Leave what remains for
the alien, the fatherless and the widow.
21When you harvest the grapes in your
vineyard, do not go over the vines again.
Leave what remains for the alien, the
fatherless and the widow.
22Remember that you were slaves in
Egypt. That is why I command you to do
this.
25When men have a dispute, they
are to take it to court and the judges will
decide the case, acquitting the innocent
and condemning the guilty.
2If the guilty man deserves to be beaten,
the judge shall make him lie down and
have him flogged in his presence with
the number of lashes his crime deserves,
3but he must not give him more than
forty lashes. If he is flogged more than
that, your brother will be degraded in
your eyes.
4Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading
out the grain.
5If brothers are living together and one
of them dies without a son, his widow
must not marry outside the family. Her
husband's brother shall take her and
marry her and fulfill the duty of a
brother-in-law to her.
6The first son she bears shall carry on
the name of the dead brother so that his
name will not be blotted out from Israel.
7However, if a man does not want to
marry his brother's wife, she shall go to
the elders at the town gate and say, "My
husband's brother refuses to carry on
his brother's name in Israel. He will not
fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to me."
8Then the elders of his town shall
summon him and talk to him. If he
persists in saying, "I do not want to
marry her,"
9his brother's widow shall go up to him
in the presence of the elders, take off
one of his sandals, spit in his face and
say, "This is what is done to the man
who will not build up his brother's family
line."
10That man's line shall be known in
Israel as The Family of the Unsandaled.
11If two men are fighting and the wife of
one of them comes to rescue her
husband from his assailant, and she
reaches out and seizes him by his
private parts,
12you shall cut off her hand. Show her
no pity.
13Do not have two differing weights in
your bag-one heavy, one light.
14Do not have two differing measures in
your house-one large, one small.
15You must have accurate and honest
weights and measures, so that you may
live long in the land the Lord your God is
giving you.
16For the Lord your God detests anyone
who does these things, anyone who
deals dishonestly.
17Remember what the Amalekites did to
you along the way when you came out
of Egypt.
18When you were weary and worn out,
they met you on your journey and cut off
all who were lagging behind; they had
no fear of God.
19When the Lord your God gives you
rest from all the enemies around you in
the land he is giving you to possess as
an inheritance, you shall blot out the
memory of Amalek from under heaven.
Do not forget!
26When you have entered the land
the Lord your God is giving you as an
inheritance and have taken possession
of it and settled in it,
2take some of the firstfruits of all that
you produce from the soil of the land the
Lord your God is giving you and put
them in a basket. Then go to the place
the Lord your God will choose as a
dwelling for his Name
3and say to the priest in office at the
time, "I declare today to the Lord your
God that I have come to the land the
Lord swore to our forefathers to give
us."
4The priest shall take the basket from
your hands and set it down in front of
the altar of the Lord your God.
5Then you shall declare before the Lord
your God: "My father was a wandering
Aramean, and he went down into Egypt
with a few people and lived there and
became a great nation, powerful and
numerous.
6But the Egyptians mistreated us and
made us suffer, putting us to hard labor.
7Then we cried out to the Lord , the God
of our fathers, and the Lord heard our
voice and saw our misery, toil and
oppression.
8So the Lord brought us out of Egypt
with a mighty hand and an outstretched
arm, with great terror and with
miraculous signs and wonders.
9He brought us to this place and gave us
this land, a land flowing with milk and
honey;
10and now I bring the firstfruits of the soil
that you, O Lord , have given me." Place
the basket before the Lord your God
and bow down before him.
11And you and the Levites and the aliens
among you shall rejoice in all the good
things the Lord your God has given to
you and your household.
12When you have finished setting aside
a tenth of all your produce in the third
year, the year of the tithe, you shall give
it to the Levite, the alien, the fatherless
and the widow, so that they may eat in
your towns and be satisfied.
13Then say to the Lord your God: "I have
removed from my house the sacred
portion and have given it to the Levite,
the alien, the fatherless and the widow,
according to all you commanded. I have
not turned aside from your commands
nor have I forgotten any of them.
14I have not eaten any of the sacred
portion while I was in mourning, nor
have I removed any of it while I was
unclean, nor have I offered any of it to
the dead. I have obeyed the Lord my
God; I have done everything you
commanded me.
15Look down from heaven, your holy
dwelling place, and bless your people
Israel and the land you have given us as
you promised on oath to our forefathers,
a land flowing with milk and honey."
16The Lord your God commands you
this day to follow these decrees and
laws; carefully observe them with all
your heart and with all your soul.
17You have declared this day that the
Lord is your God and that you will walk
in his ways, that you will keep his
decrees, commands and laws, and that
you will obey him.
18And the Lord has declared this day
that you are his people, his treasured
possession as he promised, and that
you are to keep all his commands.
19He has declared that he will set you in
praise, fame and honor high above all
the nations he has made and that you
will be a people holy to the Lord your
God, as he promised.
27Moses and the elders of Israel
commanded the people: "Keep all these
commands that I give you today.
2When you have crossed the Jordan into
the land the Lord your God is giving you,
set up some large stones and coat them
with plaster.
3Write on them all the words of this law
when you have crossed over to enter
the land the Lord your God is giving you,
a land flowing with milk and honey, just
as the Lord , the God of your fathers,
promised you.
4And when you have crossed the Jordan,
set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I
command you today, and coat them with
plaster.
5Build there an altar to the Lord your
God, an altar of stones. Do not use any
iron tool upon them.
6Build the altar of the Lord your God with
fieldstones and offer burnt offerings on it
to the Lord your God.
7Sacrifice fellowship offerings there,
eating them and rejoicing in the
presence of the Lord your God.
8And you shall write very clearly all the
words of this law on these stones you
have set up."
9Then Moses and the priests, who are
Levites, said to all Israel, "Be silent, O
Israel, and listen! You have now
become the people of the Lord your God.
10Obey the Lord your God and follow his
commands and decrees that I give you
today."
11On the same day Moses commanded
the people:
12When you have crossed the Jordan,
these tribes shall stand on Mount
Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon,
Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph and
Benjamin.
13And these tribes shall stand on Mount
Ebal to pronounce curses: Reuben, Gad,
Asher, Zebulun, Dan and Naphtali.
14The Levites shall recite to all the
people of Israel in a loud voice:
15"Cursed is the man who carves an
image or casts an idol-a thing detestable
to the Lord , the work of the craftsman's
hands-and sets it up in secret." Then all
the people shall say, "Amen!"
16"Cursed is the man who dishonors his
father or his mother." Then all the
people shall say, "Amen!"
17"Cursed is the man who moves his
neighbor's boundary stone." Then all the
people shall say, "Amen!"
18"Cursed is the man who leads the
blind astray on the road." Then all the
people shall say, "Amen!"
19"Cursed is the man who withholds
justice from the alien, the fatherless or
the widow." Then all the people shall
say, "Amen!"
20"Cursed is the man who sleeps with
his father's wife, for he dishonors his
father's bed." Then all the people shall
say, "Amen!"
21"Cursed is the man who has sexual
relations with any animal." Then all the
people shall say, "Amen!"
22"Cursed is the man who sleeps with
his sister, the daughter of his father or
the daughter of his mother." Then all the
people shall say, "Amen!"
23"Cursed is the man who sleeps with
his mother-in-law." Then all the people
shall say, "Amen!"
24"Cursed is the man who kills his
neighbor secretly." Then all the people
shall say, "Amen!"
25"Cursed is the man who accepts a
bribe to kill an innocent person." Then
all the people shall say, "Amen!"
26"Cursed is the man who does not
uphold the words of this law by carrying
them out." Then all the people shall say,
"Amen!"
28If you fully obey the Lord your God
and carefully follow all his commands I
give you today, the Lord your God will
set you high above all the nations on
earth.
2All these blessings will come upon you
and accompany you if you obey the
Lord your God:
3You will be blessed in the city and
blessed in the country.
4The fruit of your womb will be blessed,
and the crops of your land and the
young of your livestock-the calves of
your herds and the lambs of your flocks.
5Your basket and your kneading trough
will be blessed.
6You will be blessed when you come in
and blessed when you go out.
7The Lord will grant that the enemies
who rise up against you will be defeated
before you. They will come at you from
one direction but flee from you in seven.
8The Lord will send a blessing on your
barns and on everything you put your
hand to. The Lord your God will bless
you in the land he is giving you.
9The Lord will establish you as his holy
people, as he promised you on oath, if
you keep the commands of the Lord
your God and walk in his ways.
10Then all the peoples on earth will see
that you are called by the name of the
Lord , and they will fear you.
11The Lord will grant you abundant
prosperity-in the fruit of your womb, the
young of your livestock and the crops of
your ground-in the land he swore to your
forefathers to give you.
12The Lord will open the heavens, the
storehouse of his bounty, to send rain
on your land in season and to bless all
the work of your hands. You will lend to
many nations but will borrow from none.
13The Lord will make you the head, not
the tail. If you pay attention to the
commands of the Lord your God that I
give you this day and carefully follow
them, you will always be at the top,
never at the bottom.
14Do not turn aside from any of the
commands I give you today, to the right
or to the left, following other gods and
serving them.
15However, if you do not obey the Lord
your God and do not carefully follow all
his commands and decrees I am giving
you today, all these curses will come
upon you and overtake you:
16You will be cursed in the city and
cursed in the country.
17Your basket and your kneading trough
will be cursed.
18The fruit of your womb will be cursed,
and the crops of your land, and the
calves of your herds and the lambs of
your flocks.
19You will be cursed when you come in
and cursed when you go out.
20The Lord will send on you curses,
confusion and rebuke in everything you
put your hand to, until you are destroyed
and come to sudden ruin because of the
evil you have done in forsaking him.
21The Lord will plague you with diseases
until he has destroyed you from the land
you are entering to possess.
22The Lord will strike you with wasting
disease, with fever and inflammation,
with scorching heat and drought, with
blight and mildew, which will plague you
until you perish.
23The sky over your head will be bronze,
the ground beneath you iron.
24The Lord will turn the rain of your
country into dust and powder; it will
come down from the skies until you are
destroyed.
25The Lord will cause you to be defeated
before your enemies. You will come at
them from one direction but flee from
them in seven, and you will become a
thing of horror to all the kingdoms on
earth.
26Your carcasses will be food for all the
birds of the air and the beasts of the
earth, and there will be no one to
frighten them away.
27The Lord will afflict you with the boils
of Egypt and with tumors, festering
sores and the itch, from which you
cannot be cured.
28The Lord will afflict you with madness,
blindness and confusion of mind.
29At midday you will grope about like a
blind man in the dark. You will be
unsuccessful in everything you do; day
after day you will be oppressed and
robbed, with no one to rescue you.
30You will be pledged to be married to a
woman, but another will take her and
ravish her. You will build a house, but
you will not live in it. You will plant a
vineyard, but you will not even begin to
enjoy its fruit.
31Your ox will be slaughtered before
your eyes, but you will eat none of it.
Your donkey will be forcibly taken from
you and will not be returned. Your sheep
will be given to your enemies, and no
one will rescue them.
32Your sons and daughters will be given
to another nation, and you will wear out
your eyes watching for them day after
day, powerless to lift a hand.
33A people that you do not know will eat
what your land and labor produce, and
you will have nothing but cruel
oppression all your days.
34The sights you see will drive you mad.
35The Lord will afflict your knees and
legs with painful boils that cannot be
cured, spreading from the soles of your
feet to the top of your head.
36The Lord will drive you and the king
you set over you to a nation unknown to
you or your fathers. There you will
worship other gods, gods of wood and
stone.
37You will become a thing of horror and
an object of scorn and ridicule to all the
nations where the Lord will drive you.
38You will sow much seed in the field but
you will harvest little, because locusts
will devour it.
39You will plant vineyards and cultivate
them but you will not drink the wine or
gather the grapes, because worms will
eat them.
40You will have olive trees throughout
your country but you will not use the oil,
because the olives will drop off.
41You will have sons and daughters but
you will not keep them, because they
will go into captivity.
42Swarms of locusts will take over all
your trees and the crops of your land.
43The alien who lives among you will
rise above you higher and higher, but
you will sink lower and lower.
44He will lend to you, but you will not
lend to him. He will be the head, but you
will be the tail.
45All these curses will come upon you.
They will pursue you and overtake you
until you are destroyed, because you did
not obey the Lord your God and observe
the commands and decrees he gave
you.
46They will be a sign and a wonder to
you and your descendants forever.
47Because you did not serve the Lord
your God joyfully and gladly in the time
of prosperity,
48therefore in hunger and thirst, in
nakedness and dire poverty, you will
serve the enemies the Lord sends
against you. He will put an iron yoke on
your neck until he has destroyed you.
49The Lord will bring a nation against
you from far away, from the ends of the
earth, like an eagle swooping down, a
nation whose language you will not
understand,
50a fierce-looking nation without respect
for the old or pity for the young.
51They will devour the young of your
livestock and the crops of your land until
you are destroyed. They will leave you
no grain, new wine or oil, nor any calves
of your herds or lambs of your flocks
until you are ruined.
52They will lay siege to all the cities
throughout your land until the high
fortified walls in which you trust fall
down. They will besiege all the cities
throughout the land the Lord your God is
giving you.
53Because of the suffering that your
enemy will inflict on you during the siege,
you will eat the fruit of the womb, the
flesh of the sons and daughters the Lord
your God has given you.
54Even the most gentle and sensitive
man among you will have no
compassion on his own brother or the
wife he loves or his surviving children,
55and he will not give to one of them any
of the flesh of his children that he is
eating. It will be all he has left because
of the suffering your enemy will inflict on
you during the siege of all your cities.
56The most gentle and sensitive woman
among you-so sensitive and gentle that
she would not venture to touch the
ground with the sole of her foot-will
begrudge the husband she loves and
her own son or daughter
57the afterbirth from her womb and the
children she bears. For she intends to
eat them secretly during the siege and
in the distress that your enemy will inflict
on you in your cities.
58If you do not carefully follow all the
words of this law, which are written in
this book, and do not revere this
glorious and awesome name-the Lord
your God-
59the Lord will send fearful plagues on
you and your descendants, harsh and
prolonged disasters, and severe and
lingering illnesses.
60He will bring upon you all the diseases
of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will
cling to you.
61The Lord will also bring on you every
kind of sickness and disaster not
recorded in this Book of the Law, until
you are destroyed.
62You who were as numerous as the
stars in the sky will be left but few in
number, because you did not obey the
Lord your God.
63Just as it pleased the Lord to make
you prosper and increase in number, so
it will please him to ruin and destroy you.
You will be uprooted from the land you
are entering to possess.
64Then the Lord will scatter you among
all nations, from one end of the earth to
the other. There you will worship other
gods-gods of wood and stone, which
neither you nor your fathers have known.
65Among those nations you will find no
repose, no resting place for the sole of
your foot. There the Lord will give you
an anxious mind, eyes weary with
longing, and a despairing heart.
66You will live in constant suspense,
filled with dread both night and day,
never sure of your life.
67In the morning you will say, "If only it
were evening!" and in the evening, "If
only it were morning!"-because of the
terror that will fill your hearts and the
sights that your eyes will see.
68The Lord will send you back in ships to
Egypt on a journey I said you should
never make again. There you will offer
yourselves for sale to your enemies as
male and female slaves, but no one will
buy you.
29These are the terms of the
covenant the Lord commanded Moses
to make with the Israelites in Moab, in
addition to the covenant he had made
with them at Horeb.
2Moses summoned all the Israelites and
said to them: Your eyes have seen all
that the Lord did in Egypt to Pharaoh, to
all his officials and to all his land.
3With your own eyes you saw those
great trials, those miraculous signs and
great wonders.
4But to this day the Lord has not given
you a mind that understands or eyes
that see or ears that hear.
5During the forty years that I led you
through the desert, your clothes did not
wear out, nor did the sandals on your
feet.
6You ate no bread and drank no wine or
other fermented drink. I did this so that
you might know that I am the Lord your
God.
7When you reached this place, Sihon
king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan
came out to fight against us, but we
defeated them.
8We took their land and gave it as an
inheritance to the Reubenites, the
Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
9Carefully follow the terms of this
covenant, so that you may prosper in
everything you do.
10All of you are standing today in the
presence of the Lord your God-your
leaders and chief men, your elders and
officials, and all the other men of Israel,
11together with your children and your
wives, and the aliens living in your
camps who chop your wood and carry
your water.
12You are standing here in order to enter
into a covenant with the Lord your God,
a covenant the Lord is making with you
this day and sealing with an oath,
13to confirm you this day as his people,
that he may be your God as he
promised you and as he swore to your
fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
14I am making this covenant, with its
oath, not only with you
15who are standing here with us today in
the presence of the Lord our God but
also with those who are not here today.
16You yourselves know how we lived in
Egypt and how we passed through the
countries on the way here.
17You saw among them their detestable
images and idols of wood and stone, of
silver and gold.
18Make sure there is no man or woman,
clan or tribe among you today whose
heart turns away from the Lord our God
to go and worship the gods of those
nations; make sure there is no root
among you that produces such bitter
poison.
19When such a person hears the words
of this oath, he invokes a blessing on
himself and therefore thinks, "I will be
safe, even though I persist in going my
own way." This will bring disaster on the
watered land as well as the dry.
20The Lord will never be willing to forgive
him; his wrath and zeal will burn against
that man. All the curses written in this
book will fall upon him, and the Lord will
blot out his name from under heaven.
21The Lord will single him out from all
the tribes of Israel for disaster,
according to all the curses of the
covenant written in this Book of the Law.
22Your children who follow you in later
generations and foreigners who come
from distant lands will see the calamities
that have fallen on the land and the
diseases with which the Lord has
afflicted it.
23The whole land will be a burning waste
of salt and sulfur-nothing planted,
nothing sprouting, no vegetation
growing on it. It will be like the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah,
Admah and Zeboiim, which the Lord
overthrew in fierce anger.
24All the nations will ask: "Why has the
Lord done this to this land? Why this
fierce, burning anger?"
25And the answer will be: "It is because
this people abandoned the covenant of
the Lord , the God of their fathers, the
covenant he made with them when he
brought them out of Egypt.
26They went off and worshiped other
gods and bowed down to them, gods
they did not know, gods he had not
given them.
27Therefore the Lord 's anger burned
against this land, so that he brought on
it all the curses written in this book.
28In furious anger and in great wrath the
Lord uprooted them from their land and
thrust them into another land, as it is
now."
29The secret things belong to the Lord
our God, but the things revealed belong
to us and to our children forever, that we
may follow all the words of this law.
30When all these blessings and
curses I have set before you come upon
you and you take them to heart
wherever the Lord your God disperses
you among the nations,
2and when you and your children return
to the Lord your God and obey him with
all your heart and with all your soul
according to everything I command you
today,
3then the Lord your God will restore your
fortunes and have compassion on you
and gather you again from all the
nations where he scattered you.
4Even if you have been banished to the
most distant land under the heavens,
from there the Lord your God will gather
you and bring you back.
5He will bring you to the land that
belonged to your fathers, and you will
take possession of it. He will make you
more prosperous and numerous than
your fathers.
6The Lord your God will circumcise your
hearts and the hearts of your
descendants, so that you may love him
with all your heart and with all your soul,
and live.
7The Lord your God will put all these
curses on your enemies who hate and
persecute you.
8You will again obey the Lord and follow
all his commands I am giving you today.
9Then the Lord your God will make you
most prosperous in all the work of your
hands and in the fruit of your womb, the
young of your livestock and the crops of
your land. The Lord will again delight in
you and make you prosperous, just as
he delighted in your fathers,
10if you obey the Lord your God and
keep his commands and decrees that
are written in this Book of the Law and
turn to the Lord your God with all your
heart and with all your soul. The Offer of
Life or Death
11Now what I am commanding you today
is not too difficult for you or beyond your
reach.
12It is not up in heaven, so that you have
to ask, "Who will ascend into heaven to
get it and proclaim it to us so we may
obey it?"
13Nor is it beyond the sea, so that you
have to ask, "Who will cross the sea to
get it and proclaim it to us so we may
obey it?"
14No, the word is very near you; it is in
your mouth and in your heart so you
may obey it.
15See, I set before you today life and
prosperity, death and destruction.
16For I command you today to love the
Lord your God, to walk in his ways, and
to keep his commands, decrees and
laws; then you will live and increase,
and the Lord your God will bless you in
the land you are entering to possess.
17But if your heart turns away and you
are not obedient, and if you are drawn
away to bow down to other gods and
worship them,
18I declare to you this day that you will
certainly be destroyed. You will not live
long in the land you are crossing the
Jordan to enter and possess.
19This day I call heaven and earth as
witnesses against you that I have set
before you life and death, blessings and
curses. Now choose life, so that you and
your children may live
20and that you may love the Lord your
God, listen to his voice, and hold fast to
him. For the Lord is your life, and he will
give you many years in the land he
swore to give to your fathers, Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob.
31Then Moses went out and spoke
these words to all Israel:
2"I am now a hundred and twenty years
old and I am no longer able to lead you.
The Lord has said to me, 'You shall not
cross the Jordan.'
3The Lord your God himself will cross
over ahead of you. He will destroy these
nations before you, and you will take
possession of their land. Joshua also
will cross over ahead of you, as the Lord
said.
4And the Lord will do to them what he
did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the
Amorites, whom he destroyed along
with their land.
5The Lord will deliver them to you, and
you must do to them all that I have
commanded you.
6Be strong and courageous. Do not be
afraid or terrified because of them, for
the Lord your God goes with you; he will
never leave you nor forsake you."
7Then Moses summoned Joshua and
said to him in the presence of all Israel,
"Be strong and courageous, for you
must go with this people into the land
that the Lord swore to their forefathers
to give them, and you must divide it
among them as their inheritance.
8The Lord himself goes before you and
will be with you; he will never leave you
nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not
be discouraged."
9So Moses wrote down this law and
gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi,
who carried the ark of the covenant of
the Lord , and to all the elders of Israel.
10Then Moses commanded them: "At
the end of every seven years, in the
year for canceling debts, during the
Feast of Tabernacles,
11when all Israel comes to appear before
the Lord your God at the place he will
choose, you shall read this law before
them in their hearing.
12Assemble the people-men, women
and children, and the aliens living in
your towns-so they can listen and learn
to fear the Lord your God and follow
carefully all the words of this law.
13Their children, who do not know this
law, must hear it and learn to fear the
Lord your God as long as you live in the
land you are crossing the Jordan to
possess."
14The Lord said to Moses, "Now the day
of your death is near. Call Joshua and
present yourselves at the Tent of
Meeting, where I will commission him."
So Moses and Joshua came and
presented themselves at the Tent of
Meeting.
15Then the Lord appeared at the Tent in
a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood
over the entrance to the Tent.
16And the Lord said to Moses: "You are
going to rest with your fathers, and
these people will soon prostitute
themselves to the foreign gods of the
land they are entering. They will forsake
me and break the covenant I made with
them.
17On that day I will become angry with
them and forsake them; I will hide my
face from them, and they will be
destroyed. Many disasters and
difficulties will come upon them, and on
that day they will ask, 'Have not these
disasters come upon us because our
God is not with us?'
18And I will certainly hide my face on
that day because of all their wickedness
in turning to other gods.
19"Now write down for yourselves this
song and teach it to the Israelites and
have them sing it, so that it may be a
witness for me against them.
20When I have brought them into the
land flowing with milk and honey, the
land I promised on oath to their
forefathers, and when they eat their fill
and thrive, they will turn to other gods
and worship them, rejecting me and
breaking my covenant.
21And when many disasters and
difficulties come upon them, this song
will testify against them, because it will
not be forgotten by their descendants. I
know what they are disposed to do,
even before I bring them into the land I
promised them on oath."
22So Moses wrote down this song that
day and taught it to the Israelites.
23The Lord gave this command to
Joshua son of Nun: "Be strong and
courageous, for you will bring the
Israelites into the land I promised them
on oath, and I myself will be with you."
24After Moses finished writing in a book
the words of this law from beginning to
end,
25he gave this command to the Levites
who carried the ark of the covenant of
the Lord :
26"Take this Book of the Law and place it
beside the ark of the covenant of the
Lord your God. There it will remain as a
witness against you.
27For I know how rebellious and stiffnecked
you are. If you have been
rebellious against the Lord while I am
still alive and with you, how much more
will you rebel after I die!
28Assemble before me all the elders of
your tribes and all your officials, so that I
can speak these words in their hearing
and call heaven and earth to testify
against them.
29For I know that after my death you are
sure to become utterly corrupt and to
turn from the way I have commanded
you. In days to come, disaster will fall
upon you because you will do evil in the
sight of the Lord and provoke him to
anger by what your hands have made."
30And Moses recited the words of this
song from beginning to end in the
hearing of the whole assembly of Israel:
32Listen, O heavens, and I will
speak; hear, O earth, the words of my
mouth.
2Let my teaching fall like rain and my
words descend like dew, like showers
on new grass, like abundant rain on
tender plants.
3I will proclaim the name of the Lord .
Oh, praise the greatness of our God!
4He is the Rock, his works are perfect,
and all his ways are just. A faithful God
who does no wrong, upright and just is
he.
5They have acted corruptly toward him;
to their shame they are no longer his
children, but a warped and crooked
generation.
6Is this the way you repay the Lord , O
foolish and unwise people? Is he not
your Father, your Creator, who made
you and formed you?
7Remember the days of old; consider
the generations long past. Ask your
father and he will tell you, your elders,
and they will explain to you.
8When the Most High gave the nations
their inheritance, when he divided all
mankind, he set up boundaries for the
peoples according to the number of the
sons of Israel.
9For the Lord 's portion is his people,
Jacob his allotted inheritance.
10In a desert land he found him, in a
barren and howling waste. He shielded
him and cared for him; he guarded him
as the apple of his eye,
11like an eagle that stirs up its nest and
hovers over its young, that spreads its
wings to catch them and carries them on
its pinions.
12The Lord alone led him; no foreign god
was with him.
13He made him ride on the heights of the
land and fed him with the fruit of the
fields. He nourished him with honey
from the rock, and with oil from the flinty
crag,
14with curds and milk from herd and
flock and with fattened lambs and goats,
with choice rams of Bashan and the
finest kernels of wheat. You drank the
foaming blood of the grape.
15Jeshurun grew fat and kicked; filled
with food, he became heavy and sleek.
He abandoned the God who made him
and rejected the Rock his Savior.
16They made him jealous with their
foreign gods and angered him with their
detestable idols.
17They sacrificed to demons, which are
not God- gods they had not known,
gods that recently appeared, gods your
fathers did not fear.
18You deserted the Rock, who fathered
you; you forgot the God who gave you
birth.
19The Lord saw this and rejected them
because he was angered by his sons
and daughters.
20"I will hide my face from them," he said,
"and see what their end will be; for they
are a perverse generation, children who
are unfaithful.
21They made me jealous by what is no
god and angered me with their
worthless idols. I will make them
envious by those who are not a people; I
will make them angry by a nation that
has no understanding.
22For a fire has been kindled by my
wrath, one that burns to the realm of
death below. It will devour the earth and
its harvests and set afire the foundations
of the mountains.
23"I will heap calamities upon them and
spend my arrows against them.
24I will send wasting famine against
them, consuming pestilence and deadly
plague; I will send against them the
fangs of wild beasts, the venom of
vipers that glide in the dust.
25In the street the sword will make them
childless; in their homes terror will reign.
Young men and young women will
perish, infants and gray-haired men.
26I said I would scatter them and blot out
their memory from mankind,
27but I dreaded the taunt of the enemy,
lest the adversary misunderstand and
say, 'Our hand has triumphed; the Lord
has not done all this.' "
28They are a nation without sense, there
is no discernment in them.
29If only they were wise and would
understand this and discern what their
end will be!
30How could one man chase a thousand,
or two put ten thousand to flight, unless
their Rock had sold them, unless the
Lord had given them up?
31For their rock is not like our Rock, as
even our enemies concede.
32Their vine comes from the vine of
Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah.
Their grapes are filled with poison, and
their clusters with bitterness.
33Their wine is the venom of serpents,
the deadly poison of cobras.
34"Have I not kept this in reserve and
sealed it in my vaults?
35It is mine to avenge; I will repay. In
due time their foot will slip; their day of
disaster is near and their doom rushes
upon them."
36The Lord will judge his people and
have compassion on his servants when
he sees their strength is gone and no
one is left, slave or free.
37He will say: "Now where are their gods,
the rock they took refuge in,
38the gods who ate the fat of their
sacrifices and drank the wine of their
drink offerings? Let them rise up to help
you! Let them give you shelter!
39"See now that I myself am He! There
is no god besides me. I put to death and
I bring to life, I have wounded and I will
heal, and no one can deliver out of my
hand.
40I lift my hand to heaven and declare:
As surely as I live forever,
41when I sharpen my flashing sword and
my hand grasps it in judgment, I will
take vengeance on my adversaries and
repay those who hate me.
42I will make my arrows drunk with blood,
while my sword devours flesh: the blood
of the slain and the captives, the heads
of the enemy leaders."
43Rejoice, O nations, with his people, ,
for he will avenge the blood of his
servants; he will take vengeance on his
enemies and make atonement for his
land and people.
44Moses came with Joshua son of Nun
and spoke all the words of this song in
the hearing of the people.
45When Moses finished reciting all these
words to all Israel,
46he said to them, "Take to heart all the
words I have solemnly declared to you
this day, so that you may command your
children to obey carefully all the words
of this law.
47They are not just idle words for youthey
are your life. By them you will live
long in the land you are crossing the
Jordan to possess."
48On that same day the Lord told Moses,
49"Go up into the Abarim Range to
Mount Nebo in Moab, across from
Jericho, and view Canaan, the land I am
giving the Israelites as their own
possession.
50There on the mountain that you have
climbed you will die and be gathered to
your people, just as your brother Aaron
died on Mount Hor and was gathered to
his people.
51This is because both of you broke faith
with me in the presence of the Israelites
at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the
Desert of Zin and because you did not
uphold my holiness among the Israelites.
52Therefore, you will see the land only
from a distance; you will not enter the
land I am giving to the people of Israel."
33This is the blessing that Moses
the man of God pronounced on the
Israelites before his death.
2He said: "The Lord came from Sinai
and dawned over them from Seir; he
shone forth from Mount Paran. He came
with myriads of holy ones from the south,
from his mountain slopes.
3Surely it is you who love the people; all
the holy ones are in your hand. At your
feet they all bow down, and from you
receive instruction,
4the law that Moses gave us, the
possession of the assembly of Jacob.
5He was king over Jeshurun when the
leaders of the people assembled, along
with the tribes of Israel.
6"Let Reuben live and not die, nor his
men be few."
7And this he said about Judah: "Hear, O
Lord , the cry of Judah; bring him to his
people. With his own hands he defends
his cause. Oh, be his help against his
foes!"
8About Levi he said: "Your Thummim
and Urim belong to the man you favored.
You tested him at Massah; you
contended with him at the waters of
Meribah.
9He said of his father and mother, 'I
have no regard for them.' He did not
recognize his brothers or acknowledge
his own children, but he watched over
your word and guarded your covenant.
10He teaches your precepts to Jacob
and your law to Israel. He offers incense
before you and whole burnt offerings on
your altar.
11Bless all his skills, O Lord , and be
pleased with the work of his hands.
Smite the loins of those who rise up
against him; strike his foes till they rise
no more."
12About Benjamin he said: "Let the
beloved of the Lord rest secure in him,
for he shields him all day long, and the
one the Lord loves rests between his
shoulders."
13About Joseph he said: "May the Lord
bless his land with the precious dew
from heaven above and with the deep
waters that lie below;
14with the best the sun brings forth and
the finest the moon can yield;
15with the choicest gifts of the ancient
mountains and the fruitfulness of the
everlasting hills;
16with the best gifts of the earth and its
fullness and the favor of him who dwelt
in the burning bush. Let all these rest on
the head of Joseph, on the brow of the
prince among his brothers.
17In majesty he is like a firstborn bull; his
horns are the horns of a wild ox. With
them he will gore the nations, even
those at the ends of the earth. Such are
the ten thousands of Ephraim; such are
the thousands of Manasseh."
18About Zebulun he said: "Rejoice,
Zebulun, in your going out, and you,
Issachar, in your tents.
19They will summon peoples to the
mountain and there offer sacrifices of
righteousness; they will feast on the
abundance of the seas, on the treasures
hidden in the sand."
20About Gad he said: "Blessed is he who
enlarges Gad's domain! Gad lives there
like a lion, tearing at arm or head.
21He chose the best land for himself; the
leader's portion was kept for him. When
the heads of the people assembled, he
carried out the Lord 's righteous will, and
his judgments concerning Israel."
22About Dan he said: "Dan is a lion's cub,
springing out of Bashan."
23About Naphtali he said: "Naphtali is
abounding with the favor of the Lord and
is full of his blessing; he will inherit
southward to the lake."
24About Asher he said: "Most blessed of
sons is Asher; let him be favored by his
brothers, and let him bathe his feet in oil.
25The bolts of your gates will be iron and
bronze, and your strength will equal
your days.
26"There is no one like the God of
Jeshurun, who rides on the heavens to
help you and on the clouds in his
majesty.
27The eternal God is your refuge, and
underneath are the everlasting arms. He
will drive out your enemy before you,
saying, 'Destroy him!'
28So Israel will live in safety alone;
Jacob's spring is secure in a land of
grain and new wine, where the heavens
drop dew.
29Blessed are you, O Israel! Who is like
you, a people saved by the Lord ? He is
your shield and helper and your glorious
sword. Your enemies will cower before
you, and you will trample down their
high places. "
34Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo
from the plains of Moab to the top of
Pisgah, across from Jericho. There the
Lord showed him the whole land-from
Gilead to Dan,
2all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim
and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as
far as the western sea,
3the Negev and the whole region from
the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms,
as far as Zoar.
4Then the Lord said to him, "This is the
land I promised on oath to Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob when I said, 'I will give
it to your descendants.' I have let you
see it with your eyes, but you will not
cross over into it."
5And Moses the servant of the Lord died
there in Moab, as the Lord had said.
6He buried him in Moab, in the valley
opposite Beth Peor, but to this day no
one knows where his grave is.
7Moses was a hundred and twenty years
old when he died, yet his eyes were not
weak nor his strength gone.
8The Israelites grieved for Moses in the
plains of Moab thirty days, until the time
of weeping and mourning was over.
9Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with
the spirit of wisdom because Moses had
laid his hands on him. So the Israelites
listened to him and did what the Lord
had commanded Moses.
10Since then, no prophet has risen in
Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew
face to face,
11who did all those miraculous signs and
wonders the Lord sent him to do in
Egypt-to Pharaoh and to all his officials
and to his whole land.
12For no one has ever shown the mighty
power or performed the awesome deeds
that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.
Joshua
1After the death of Moses the servant
of the Lord , the Lord said to Joshua son
of Nun, Moses' aide:
2"Moses my servant is dead. Now then,
you and all these people, get ready to
cross the Jordan River into the land I am
about to give to them-to the Israelites.
3I will give you every place where you
set your foot, as I promised Moses.
4Your territory will extend from the
desert to Lebanon, and from the great
river, the Euphrates-all the Hittite
country-to the Great Sea on the west.
5No one will be able to stand up against
you all the days of your life. As I was
with Moses, so I will be with you; I will
never leave you nor forsake you.
6"Be strong and courageous, because
you will lead these people to inherit the
land I swore to their forefathers to give
them.
7Be strong and very courageous. Be
careful to obey all the law my servant
Moses gave you; do not turn from it to
the right or to the left, that you may be
successful wherever you go.
8Do not let this Book of the Law depart
from your mouth; meditate on it day and
night, so that you may be careful to do
everything written in it. Then you will be
prosperous and successful.
9Have I not commanded you? Be strong
and courageous. Do not be terrified; do
not be discouraged, for the Lord your
God will be with you wherever you go."
10So Joshua ordered the officers of the
people:
11"Go through the camp and tell the
people, 'Get your supplies ready. Three
days from now you will cross the Jordan
here to go in and take possession of the
land the Lord your God is giving you for
your own.' "
12But to the Reubenites, the Gadites and
the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,
13"Remember the command that Moses
the servant of the Lord gave you: 'The
Lord your God is giving you rest and has
granted you this land.'
14Your wives, your children and your
livestock may stay in the land that
Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but
all your fighting men, fully armed, must
cross over ahead of your brothers. You
are to help your brothers
15until the Lord gives them rest, as he
has done for you, and until they too
have taken possession of the land that
the Lord your God is giving them. After
that, you may go back and occupy your
own land, which Moses the servant of
the Lord gave you east of the Jordan
toward the sunrise."
16Then they answered Joshua,
"Whatever you have commanded us we
will do, and wherever you send us we
will go.
17Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we
will obey you. Only may the Lord your
God be with you as he was with Moses.
18Whoever rebels against your word and
does not obey your words, whatever you
may command them, will be put to death.
Only be strong and courageous!"
2Then Joshua son of Nun secretly
sent two spies from Shittim. "Go, look
over the land," he said, "especially
Jericho." So they went and entered the
house of a prostitute named Rahab and
stayed there.
2The king of Jericho was told, "Look!
Some of the Israelites have come here
tonight to spy out the land."
3So the king of Jericho sent this
message to Rahab: "Bring out the men
who came to you and entered your
house, because they have come to spy
out the whole land."
4But the woman had taken the two men
and hidden them. She said, "Yes, the
men came to me, but I did not know
where they had come from.
5At dusk, when it was time to close the
city gate, the men left. I don't know
which way they went. Go after them
quickly. You may catch up with them."
6(But she had taken them up to the roof
and hidden them under the stalks of flax
she had laid out on the roof.)
7So the men set out in pursuit of the
spies on the road that leads to the fords
of the Jordan, and as soon as the
pursuers had gone out, the gate was
shut.
8Before the spies lay down for the night,
she went up on the roof
9and said to them, "I know that the Lord
has given this land to you and that a
great fear of you has fallen on us, so
that all who live in this country are
melting in fear because of you.
10We have heard how the Lord dried up
the water of the Red Sea for you when
you came out of Egypt, and what you
did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of
the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom
you completely destroyed.
11When we heard of it, our hearts melted
and everyone's courage failed because
of you, for the Lord your God is God in
heaven above and on the earth below.
12Now then, please swear to me by the
Lord that you will show kindness to my
family, because I have shown kindness
to you. Give me a sure sign
13that you will spare the lives of my
father and mother, my brothers and
sisters, and all who belong to them, and
that you will save us from death."
14"Our lives for your lives!" the men
assured her. "If you don't tell what we
are doing, we will treat you kindly and
faithfully when the Lord gives us the
land."
15So she let them down by a rope
through the window, for the house she
lived in was part of the city wall.
16Now she had said to them, "Go to the
hills so the pursuers will not find you.
Hide yourselves there three days until
they return, and then go on your way."
17The men said to her, "This oath you
made us swear will not be binding on us
18unless, when we enter the land, you
have tied this scarlet cord in the window
through which you let us down, and
unless you have brought your father and
mother, your brothers and all your family
into your house.
19If anyone goes outside your house into
the street, his blood will be on his own
head; we will not be responsible. As for
anyone who is in the house with you, his
blood will be on our head if a hand is
laid on him.
20But if you tell what we are doing, we
will be released from the oath you made
us swear."
21"Agreed," she replied. "Let it be as you
say." So she sent them away and they
departed. And she tied the scarlet cord
in the window.
22When they left, they went into the hills
and stayed there three days, until the
pursuers had searched all along the
road and returned without finding them.
23Then the two men started back. They
went down out of the hills, forded the
river and came to Joshua son of Nun
and told him everything that had
happened to them.
24They said to Joshua, "The Lord has
surely given the whole land into our
hands; all the people are melting in fear
because of us."
3Early in the morning Joshua and all
the Israelites set out from Shittim and
went to the Jordan, where they camped
before crossing over.
2After three days the officers went
throughout the camp,
3giving orders to the people: "When you
see the ark of the covenant of the Lord
your God, and the priests, who are
Levites, carrying it, you are to move out
from your positions and follow it.
4Then you will know which way to go,
since you have never been this way
before. But keep a distance of about a
thousand yards between you and the
ark; do not go near it."
5Joshua told the people, "Consecrate
yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do
amazing things among you."
6Joshua said to the priests, "Take up the
ark of the covenant and pass on ahead
of the people." So they took it up and
went ahead of them.
7And the Lord said to Joshua, "Today I
will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all
Israel, so they may know that I am with
you as I was with Moses.
8Tell the priests who carry the ark of the
covenant: 'When you reach the edge of
the Jordan's waters, go and stand in the
river.' "
9Joshua said to the Israelites, "Come
here and listen to the words of the Lord
your God.
10This is how you will know that the
living God is among you and that he will
certainly drive out before you the
Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites,
Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites.
11See, the ark of the covenant of the
Lord of all the earth will go into the
Jordan ahead of you.
12Now then, choose twelve men from
the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.
13And as soon as the priests who carry
the ark of the Lord -the Lord of all the
earth-set foot in the Jordan, its waters
flowing downstream will be cut off and
stand up in a heap."
14So when the people broke camp to
cross the Jordan, the priests carrying
the ark of the covenant went ahead of
them.
15Now the Jordan is at flood stage all
during harvest. Yet as soon as the
priests who carried the ark reached the
Jordan and their feet touched the
water's edge,
16the water from upstream stopped
flowing. It piled up in a heap a great
distance away, at a town called Adam in
the vicinity of Zarethan, while the water
flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah
(the Salt Sea ) was completely cut off.
So the people crossed over opposite
Jericho.
17The priests who carried the ark of the
covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry
ground in the middle of the Jordan,
while all Israel passed by until the whole
nation had completed the crossing on
dry ground.
4When the whole nation had finished
crossing the Jordan, the Lord said to
Joshua,
2"Choose twelve men from among the
people, one from each tribe,
3and tell them to take up twelve stones
from the middle of the Jordan from right
where the priests stood and to carry
them over with you and put them down
at the place where you stay tonight."
4So Joshua called together the twelve
men he had appointed from the
Israelites, one from each tribe,
5and said to them, "Go over before the
ark of the Lord your God into the middle
of the Jordan. Each of you is to take up
a stone on his shoulder, according to
the number of the tribes of the Israelites,
6to serve as a sign among you. In the
future, when your children ask you,
'What do these stones mean?'
7tell them that the flow of the Jordan was
cut off before the ark of the covenant of
the Lord . When it crossed the Jordan,
the waters of the Jordan were cut off.
These stones are to be a memorial to
the people of Israel forever."
8So the Israelites did as Joshua
commanded them. They took twelve
stones from the middle of the Jordan,
according to the number of the tribes of
the Israelites, as the Lord had told
Joshua; and they carried them over with
them to their camp, where they put them
down.
9Joshua set up the twelve stones that
had been in the middle of the Jordan at
the spot where the priests who carried
the ark of the covenant had stood. And
they are there to this day.
10Now the priests who carried the ark
remained standing in the middle of the
Jordan until everything the Lord had
commanded Joshua was done by the
people, just as Moses had directed
Joshua. The people hurried over,
11and as soon as all of them had
crossed, the ark of the Lord and the
priests came to the other side while the
people watched.
12The men of Reuben, Gad and the halftribe
of Manasseh crossed over, armed,
in front of the Israelites, as Moses had
directed them.
13About forty thousand armed for battle
crossed over before the Lord to the
plains of Jericho for war.
14That day the Lord exalted Joshua in
the sight of all Israel; and they revered
him all the days of his life, just as they
had revered Moses.
15Then the Lord said to Joshua,
16"Command the priests carrying the ark
of the Testimony to come up out of the
Jordan."
17So Joshua commanded the priests,
"Come up out of the Jordan."
18And the priests came up out of the
river carrying the ark of the covenant of
the Lord . No sooner had they set their
feet on the dry ground than the waters
of the Jordan returned to their place and
ran at flood stage as before.
19On the tenth day of the first month the
people went up from the Jordan and
camped at Gilgal on the eastern border
of Jericho.
20And Joshua set up at Gilgal the twelve
stones they had taken out of the Jordan.
21He said to the Israelites, "In the future
when your descendants ask their fathers,
'What do these stones mean?'
22tell them, 'Israel crossed the Jordan on
dry ground.'
23For the Lord your God dried up the
Jordan before you until you had crossed
over. The Lord your God did to the
Jordan just what he had done to the
Red Sea when he dried it up before us
until we had crossed over.
24He did this so that all the peoples of
the earth might know that the hand of
the Lord is powerful and so that you
might always fear the Lord your God."
5Now when all the Amorite kings west
of the Jordan and all the Canaanite
kings along the coast heard how the
Lord had dried up the Jordan before the
Israelites until we had crossed over,
their hearts melted and they no longer
had the courage to face the Israelites.
2At that time the Lord said to Joshua,
"Make flint knives and circumcise the
Israelites again."
3So Joshua made flint knives and
circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath
Haaraloth.
4Now this is why he did so: All those
who came out of Egypt-all the men of
military age-died in the desert on the
way after leaving Egypt.
5All the people that came out had been
circumcised, but all the people born in
the desert during the journey from Egypt
had not.
6The Israelites had moved about in the
desert forty years until all the men who
were of military age when they left Egypt
had died, since they had not obeyed the
Lord . For the Lord had sworn to them
that they would not see the land that he
had solemnly promised their fathers to
give us, a land flowing with milk and
honey.
7So he raised up their sons in their place,
and these were the ones Joshua
circumcised. They were still
uncircumcised because they had not
been circumcised on the way.
8And after the whole nation had been
circumcised, they remained where they
were in camp until they were healed.
9Then the Lord said to Joshua, "Today I
have rolled away the reproach of Egypt
from you." So the place has been called
Gilgal to this day.
10On the evening of the fourteenth day
of the month, while camped at Gilgal on
the plains of Jericho, the Israelites
celebrated the Passover.
11The day after the Passover, that very
day, they ate some of the produce of the
land: unleavened bread and roasted
grain.
12The manna stopped the day after they
ate this food from the land; there was no
longer any manna for the Israelites, but
that year they ate of the produce of
Canaan.
13Now when Joshua was near Jericho,
he looked up and saw a man standing in
front of him with a drawn sword in his
hand. Joshua went up to him and asked,
"Are you for us or for our enemies?"
14"Neither," he replied, "but as
commander of the army of the Lord I
have now come." Then Joshua fell
facedown to the ground in reverence,
and asked him, "What message does
my Lord have for his servant?"
15The commander of the Lord 's army
replied, "Take off your sandals, for the
place where you are standing is holy."
And Joshua did so.
6Now Jericho was tightly shut up
because of the Israelites. No one went
out and no one came in.
2Then the Lord said to Joshua, "See, I
have delivered Jericho into your hands,
along with its king and its fighting men.
3March around the city once with all the
armed men. Do this for six days.
4Have seven priests carry trumpets of
rams' horns in front of the ark. On the
seventh day, march around the city
seven times, with the priests blowing the
trumpets.
5When you hear them sound a long
blast on the trumpets, have all the
people give a loud shout; then the wall
of the city will collapse and the people
will go up, every man straight in."
6So Joshua son of Nun called the priests
and said to them, "Take up the ark of
the covenant of the Lord and have
seven priests carry trumpets in front of
it."
7And he ordered the people, "Advance!
March around the city, with the armed
guard going ahead of the ark of the
Lord ."
8When Joshua had spoken to the people,
the seven priests carrying the seven
trumpets before the Lord went forward,
blowing their trumpets, and the ark of
the Lord 's covenant followed them.
9The armed guard marched ahead of
the priests who blew the trumpets, and
the rear guard followed the ark. All this
time the trumpets were sounding.
10But Joshua had commanded the
people, "Do not give a war cry, do not
raise your voices, do not say a word
until the day I tell you to shout. Then
shout!"
11So he had the ark of the Lord carried
around the city, circling it once. Then the
people returned to camp and spent the
night there.
12Joshua got up early the next morning
and the priests took up the ark of the
Lord .
13The seven priests carrying the seven
trumpets went forward, marching before
the ark of the Lord and blowing the
trumpets. The armed men went ahead
of them and the rear guard followed the
ark of the Lord , while the trumpets kept
sounding.
14So on the second day they marched
around the city once and returned to the
camp. They did this for six days.
15On the seventh day, they got up at
daybreak and marched around the city
seven times in the same manner, except
that on that day they circled the city
seven times.
16The seventh time around, when the
priests sounded the trumpet blast,
Joshua commanded the people, "Shout!
For the Lord has given you the city!
17The city and all that is in it are to be
devoted to the Lord . Only Rahab the
prostitute and all who are with her in her
house shall be spared, because she hid
the spies we sent.
18But keep away from the devoted
things, so that you will not bring about
your own destruction by taking any of
them. Otherwise you will make the camp
of Israel liable to destruction and bring
trouble on it.
19All the silver and gold and the articles
of bronze and iron are sacred to the
Lord and must go into his treasury."
20When the trumpets sounded, the
people shouted, and at the sound of the
trumpet, when the people gave a loud
shout, the wall collapsed; so every man
charged straight in, and they took the
city.
21They devoted the city to the Lord and
destroyed with the sword every living
thing in it-men and women, young and
old, cattle, sheep and donkeys.
22Joshua said to the two men who had
spied out the land, "Go into the
prostitute's house and bring her out and
all who belong to her, in accordance
with your oath to her."
23So the young men who had done the
spying went in and brought out Rahab,
her father and mother and brothers and
all who belonged to her. They brought
out her entire family and put them in a
place outside the camp of Israel.
24Then they burned the whole city and
everything in it, but they put the silver
and gold and the articles of bronze and
iron into the treasury of the Lord 's
house.
25But Joshua spared Rahab the
prostitute, with her family and all who
belonged to her, because she hid the
men Joshua had sent as spies to
Jericho-and she lives among the
Israelites to this day.
26At that time Joshua pronounced this
solemn oath: "Cursed before the Lord is
the man who undertakes to rebuild this
city, Jericho: "At the cost of his firstborn
son will he lay its foundations; at the
cost of his youngest will he set up its
gates."
27So the Lord was with Joshua, and his
fame spread throughout the land.
7But the Israelites acted unfaithfully in
regard to the devoted things ; Achan
son of Carmi, the son of Zimri, the son
of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took
some of them. So the Lord 's anger
burned against Israel.
2Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to
Ai, which is near Beth Aven to the east
of Bethel, and told them, "Go up and spy
out the region." So the men went up and
spied out Ai.
3When they returned to Joshua, they
said, "Not all the people will have to go
up against Ai. Send two or three
thousand men to take it and do not
weary all the people, for only a few men
are there."
4So about three thousand men went up;
but they were routed by the men of Ai,
5who killed about thirty-six of them. They
chased the Israelites from the city gate
as far as the stone quarries and struck
them down on the slopes. At this the
hearts of the people melted and became
like water.
6Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell
facedown to the ground before the ark
of the Lord , remaining there till evening.
The elders of Israel did the same, and
sprinkled dust on their heads.
7And Joshua said, "Ah, Sovereign Lord ,
why did you ever bring this people
across the Jordan to deliver us into the
hands of the Amorites to destroy us? If
only we had been content to stay on the
other side of the Jordan!
8O Lord, what can I say, now that Israel
has been routed by its enemies?
9The Canaanites and the other people of
the country will hear about this and they
will surround us and wipe out our name
from the earth. What then will you do for
your own great name?"
10The Lord said to Joshua, "Stand up!
What are you doing down on your face?
11Israel has sinned; they have violated
my covenant, which I commanded them
to keep. They have taken some of the
devoted things; they have stolen, they
have lied, they have put them with their
own possessions.
12That is why the Israelites cannot stand
against their enemies; they turn their
backs and run because they have been
made liable to destruction. I will not be
with you anymore unless you destroy
whatever among you is devoted to
destruction.
13"Go, consecrate the people. Tell them,
'Consecrate yourselves in preparation
for tomorrow; for this is what the Lord ,
the God of Israel, says: That which is
devoted is among you, O Israel. You
cannot stand against your enemies until
you remove it.
14" 'In the morning, present yourselves
tribe by tribe. The tribe that the Lord
takes shall come forward clan by clan;
the clan that the Lord takes shall come
forward family by family; and the family
that the Lord takes shall come forward
man by man.
15He who is caught with the devoted
things shall be destroyed by fire, along
with all that belongs to him. He has
violated the covenant of the Lord and
has done a disgraceful thing in Israel!' "
16Early the next morning Joshua had
Israel come forward by tribes, and
Judah was taken.
17The clans of Judah came forward, and
he took the Zerahites. He had the clan
of the Zerahites come forward by
families, and Zimri was taken.
18Joshua had his family come forward
man by man, and Achan son of Carmi,
the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the
tribe of Judah, was taken.
19Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son,
give glory to the Lord , the God of Israel,
and give him the praise. Tell me what
you have done; do not hide it from me."
20Achan replied, "It is true! I have sinned
against the Lord , the God of Israel. This
is what I have done:
21When I saw in the plunder a beautiful
robe from Babylonia, two hundred
shekels of silver and a wedge of gold
weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them
and took them. They are hidden in the
ground inside my tent, with the silver
underneath."
22So Joshua sent messengers, and they
ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden
in his tent, with the silver underneath.
23They took the things from the tent,
brought them to Joshua and all the
Israelites and spread them out before
the Lord .
24Then Joshua, together with all Israel,
took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the
robe, the gold wedge, his sons and
daughters, his cattle, donkeys and
sheep, his tent and all that he had, to
the Valley of Achor.
25Joshua said, "Why have you brought
this trouble on us? The Lord will bring
trouble on you today." Then all Israel
stoned him, and after they had stoned
the rest, they burned them.
26Over Achan they heaped up a large
pile of rocks, which remains to this day.
Then the Lord turned from his fierce
anger. Therefore that place has been
called the Valley of Achor ever since.
8Then the Lord said to Joshua, "Do
not be afraid; do not be discouraged.
Take the whole army with you, and go
up and attack Ai. For I have delivered
into your hands the king of Ai, his
people, his city and his land.
2You shall do to Ai and its king as you
did to Jericho and its king, except that
you may carry off their plunder and
livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush
behind the city."
3So Joshua and the whole army moved
out to attack Ai. He chose thirty
thousand of his best fighting men and
sent them out at night
4with these orders: "Listen carefully. You
are to set an ambush behind the city.
Don't go very far from it. All of you be on
the alert.
5I and all those with me will advance on
the city, and when the men come out
against us, as they did before, we will
flee from them.
6They will pursue us until we have lured
them away from the city, for they will say,
'They are running away from us as they
did before.' So when we flee from them,
7you are to rise up from ambush and
take the city. The Lord your God will
give it into your hand.
8When you have taken the city, set it on
fire. Do what the Lord has commanded.
See to it; you have my orders."
9Then Joshua sent them off, and they
went to the place of ambush and lay in
wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west
of Ai-but Joshua spent that night with
the people.
10Early the next morning Joshua
mustered his men, and he and the
leaders of Israel marched before them
to Ai.
11The entire force that was with him
marched up and approached the city
and arrived in front of it. They set up
camp north of Ai, with the valley
between them and the city.
12Joshua had taken about five thousand
men and set them in ambush between
Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.
13They had the soldiers take up their
positions-all those in the camp to the
north of the city and the ambush to the
west of it. That night Joshua went into
the valley.
14When the king of Ai saw this, he and
all the men of the city hurried out early
in the morning to meet Israel in battle at
a certain place overlooking the Arabah.
But he did not know that an ambush had
been set against him behind the city.
15Joshua and all Israel let themselves be
driven back before them, and they fled
toward the desert.
16All the men of Ai were called to pursue
them, and they pursued Joshua and
were lured away from the city.
17Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel
who did not go after Israel. They left the
city open and went in pursuit of Israel.
18Then the Lord said to Joshua, "Hold
out toward Ai the javelin that is in your
hand, for into your hand I will deliver the
city." So Joshua held out his javelin
toward Ai.
19As soon as he did this, the men in the
ambush rose quickly from their position
and rushed forward. They entered the
city and captured it and quickly set it on
fire.
20The men of Ai looked back and saw
the smoke of the city rising against the
sky, but they had no chance to escape
in any direction, for the Israelites who
had been fleeing toward the desert had
turned back against their pursuers.
21For when Joshua and all Israel saw
that the ambush had taken the city and
that smoke was going up from the city,
they turned around and attacked the
men of Ai.
22The men of the ambush also came out
of the city against them, so that they
were caught in the middle, with
Israelites on both sides. Israel cut them
down, leaving them neither survivors nor
fugitives.
23But they took the king of Ai alive and
brought him to Joshua.
24When Israel had finished killing all the
men of Ai in the fields and in the desert
where they had chased them, and when
every one of them had been put to the
sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai
and killed those who were in it.
25Twelve thousand men and women fell
that day-all the people of Ai.
26For Joshua did not draw back the
hand that held out his javelin until he
had destroyed all who lived in Ai.
27But Israel did carry off for themselves
the livestock and plunder of this city, as
the Lord had instructed Joshua.
28So Joshua burned Ai and made it a
permanent heap of ruins, a desolate
place to this day.
29He hung the king of Ai on a tree and
left him there until evening. At sunset,
Joshua ordered them to take his body
from the tree and throw it down at the
entrance of the city gate. And they
raised a large pile of rocks over it, which
remains to this day.
30Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an
altar to the Lord , the God of Israel,
31as Moses the servant of the Lord had
commanded the Israelites. He built it
according to what is written in the Book
of the Law of Moses-an altar of uncut
stones, on which no iron tool had been
used. On it they offered to the Lord
burnt offerings and sacrificed fellowship
offerings.
32There, in the presence of the Israelites,
Joshua copied on stones the law of
Moses, which he had written.
33All Israel, aliens and citizens alike, with
their elders, officials and judges, were
standing on both sides of the ark of the
covenant of the Lord , facing those who
carried it-the priests, who were Levites.
Half of the people stood in front of
Mount Gerizim and half of them in front
of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of
the Lord had formerly commanded when
he gave instructions to bless the people
of Israel.
34Afterward, Joshua read all the words
of the law-the blessings and the cursesjust
as it is written in the Book of the
Law.
35There was not a word of all that Moses
had commanded that Joshua did not
read to the whole assembly of Israel,
including the women and children, and
the aliens who lived among them.
9Now when all the kings west of the
Jordan heard about these things-those
in the hill country, in the western foothills,
and along the entire coast of the Great
Sea as far as Lebanon (the kings of the
Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites,
Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites)-
2they came together to make war
against Joshua and Israel.
3However, when the people of Gibeon
heard what Joshua had done to Jericho
and Ai,
4they resorted to a ruse: They went as a
delegation whose donkeys were loaded
with worn-out sacks and old wineskins,
cracked and mended.
5The men put worn and patched sandals
on their feet and wore old clothes. All
the bread of their food supply was dry
and moldy.
6Then they went to Joshua in the camp
at Gilgal and said to him and the men of
Israel, "We have come from a distant
country; make a treaty with us."
7The men of Israel said to the Hivites,
"But perhaps you live near us. How then
can we make a treaty with you?"
8"We are your servants," they said to
Joshua. But Joshua asked, "Who are
you and where do you come from?"
9They answered: "Your servants have
come from a very distant country
because of the fame of the Lord your
God. For we have heard reports of him:
all that he did in Egypt,
10and all that he did to the two kings of
the Amorites east of the Jordan-Sihon
king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan,
who reigned in Ashtaroth.
11And our elders and all those living in
our country said to us, 'Take provisions
for your journey; go and meet them and
say to them, "We are your servants;
make a treaty with us." '
12This bread of ours was warm when we
packed it at home on the day we left to
come to you. But now see how dry and
moldy it is.
13And these wineskins that we filled
were new, but see how cracked they are.
And our clothes and sandals are worn
out by the very long journey."
14The men of Israel sampled their
provisions but did not inquire of the
Lord .
15Then Joshua made a treaty of peace
with them to let them live, and the
leaders of the assembly ratified it by
oath.
16Three days after they made the treaty
with the Gibeonites, the Israelites heard
that they were neighbors, living near
them.
17So the Israelites set out and on the
third day came to their cities: Gibeon,
Kephirah, Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim.
18But the Israelites did not attack them,
because the leaders of the assembly
had sworn an oath to them by the Lord ,
the God of Israel. The whole assembly
grumbled against the leaders,
19but all the leaders answered, "We
have given them our oath by the Lord ,
the God of Israel, and we cannot touch
them now.
20This is what we will do to them: We will
let them live, so that wrath will not fall on
us for breaking the oath we swore to
them."
21They continued, "Let them live, but let
them be woodcutters and water carriers
for the entire community." So the
leaders' promise to them was kept.
22Then Joshua summoned the
Gibeonites and said, "Why did you
deceive us by saying, 'We live a long
way from you,' while actually you live
near us?
23You are now under a curse: You will
never cease to serve as woodcutters
and water carriers for the house of my
God."
24They answered Joshua, "Your
servants were clearly told how the Lord
your God had commanded his servant
Moses to give you the whole land and to
wipe out all its inhabitants from before
you. So we feared for our lives because
of you, and that is why we did this.
25We are now in your hands. Do to us
whatever seems good and right to you."
26So Joshua saved them from the
Israelites, and they did not kill them.
27That day he made the Gibeonites
woodcutters and water carriers for the
community and for the altar of the Lord
at the place the Lord would choose. And
that is what they are to this day.
10Now Adoni-Zedek king of
Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken
Ai and totally destroyed it, doing to Ai
and its king as he had done to Jericho
and its king, and that the people of
Gibeon had made a treaty of peace with
Israel and were living near them.
2He and his people were very much
alarmed at this, because Gibeon was an
important city, like one of the royal
cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its
men were good fighters.
3So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem
appealed to Hoham king of Hebron,
Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of
Lachish and Debir king of Eglon.
4"Come up and help me attack Gibeon,"
he said, "because it has made peace
with Joshua and the Israelites."
5Then the five kings of the Amorites-the
kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth,
Lachish and Eglon-joined forces. They
moved up with all their troops and took
up positions against Gibeon and
attacked it.
6The Gibeonites then sent word to
Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: "Do not
abandon your servants. Come up to us
quickly and save us! Help us, because
all the Amorite kings from the hill
country have joined forces against us."
7So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with
his entire army, including all the best
fighting men.
8The Lord said to Joshua, "Do not be
afraid of them; I have given them into
your hand. Not one of them will be able
to withstand you."
9After an all-night march from Gilgal,
Joshua took them by surprise.
10The Lord threw them into confusion
before Israel, who defeated them in a
great victory at Gibeon. Israel pursued
them along the road going up to Beth
Horon and cut them down all the way to
Azekah and Makkedah.
11As they fled before Israel on the road
down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the
Lord hurled large hailstones down on
them from the sky, and more of them
died from the hailstones than were killed
by the swords of the Israelites.
12On the day the Lord gave the Amorites
over to Israel, Joshua said to the Lord in
the presence of Israel: "O sun, stand still
over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of
Aijalon."
13So the sun stood still, and the moon
stopped, till the nation avenged itself on
its enemies, as it is written in the Book
of Jashar. The sun stopped in the
middle of the sky and delayed going
down about a full day.
14There has never been a day like it
before or since, a day when the Lord
listened to a man. Surely the Lord was
fighting for Israel!
15Then Joshua returned with all Israel to
the camp at Gilgal.
16Now the five kings had fled and hidden
in the cave at Makkedah.
17When Joshua was told that the five
kings had been found hiding in the cave
at Makkedah,
18he said, "Roll large rocks up to the
mouth of the cave, and post some men
there to guard it.
19But don't stop! Pursue your enemies,
attack them from the rear and don't let
them reach their cities, for the Lord your
God has given them into your hand."
20So Joshua and the Israelites
destroyed them completely-almost to a
man-but the few who were left reached
their fortified cities.
21The whole army then returned safely
to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah,
and no one uttered a word against the
Israelites.
22Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the
cave and bring those five kings out to
me."
23So they brought the five kings out of
the cave-the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron,
Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon.
24When they had brought these kings to
Joshua, he summoned all the men of
Israel and said to the army commanders
who had come with him, "Come here
and put your feet on the necks of these
kings." So they came forward and
placed their feet on their necks.
25Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid;
do not be discouraged. Be strong and
courageous. This is what the Lord will
do to all the enemies you are going to
fight."
26Then Joshua struck and killed the
kings and hung them on five trees, and
they were left hanging on the trees until
evening.
27At sunset Joshua gave the order and
they took them down from the trees and
threw them into the cave where they
had been hiding. At the mouth of the
cave they placed large rocks, which are
there to this day.
28That day Joshua took Makkedah. He
put the city and its king to the sword and
totally destroyed everyone in it. He left
no survivors. And he did to the king of
Makkedah as he had done to the king of
Jericho.
29Then Joshua and all Israel with him
moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and
attacked it.
30The Lord also gave that city and its
king into Israel's hand. The city and
everyone in it Joshua put to the sword.
He left no survivors there. And he did to
its king as he had done to the king of
Jericho.
31Then Joshua and all Israel with him
moved on from Libnah to Lachish; he
took up positions against it and attacked
it.
32The Lord handed Lachish over to
Israel, and Joshua took it on the second
day. The city and everyone in it he put
to the sword, just as he had done to
Libnah.
33Meanwhile, Horam king of Gezer had
come up to help Lachish, but Joshua
defeated him and his army-until no
survivors were left.
34Then Joshua and all Israel with him
moved on from Lachish to Eglon; they
took up positions against it and attacked
it.
35They captured it that same day and
put it to the sword and totally destroyed
everyone in it, just as they had done to
Lachish.
36Then Joshua and all Israel with him
went up from Eglon to Hebron and
attacked it.
37They took the city and put it to the
sword, together with its king, its villages
and everyone in it. They left no survivors.
Just as at Eglon, they totally destroyed it
and everyone in it.
38Then Joshua and all Israel with him
turned around and attacked Debir.
39They took the city, its king and its
villages, and put them to the sword.
Everyone in it they totally destroyed.
They left no survivors. They did to Debir
and its king as they had done to Libnah
and its king and to Hebron.
40So Joshua subdued the whole region,
including the hill country, the Negev, the
western foothills and the mountain
slopes, together with all their kings. He
left no survivors. He totally destroyed all
who breathed, just as the Lord , the God
of Israel, had commanded.
41Joshua subdued them from Kadesh
Barnea to Gaza and from the whole
region of Goshen to Gibeon.
42All these kings and their lands Joshua
conquered in one campaign, because
the Lord , the God of Israel, fought for
Israel.
43Then Joshua returned with all Israel to
the camp at Gilgal.
11When Jabin king of Hazor heard
of this, he sent word to Jobab king of
Madon, to the kings of Shimron and
Acshaph,
2and to the northern kings who were in
the mountains, in the Arabah south of
Kinnereth, in the western foothills and in
Naphoth Dor on the west;
3to the Canaanites in the east and west;
to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites and
Jebusites in the hill country; and to the
Hivites below Hermon in the region of
Mizpah.
4They came out with all their troops and
a large number of horses and chariots-a
huge army, as numerous as the sand on
the seashore.
5All these kings joined forces and made
camp together at the Waters of Merom,
to fight against Israel.
6The Lord said to Joshua, "Do not be
afraid of them, because by this time
tomorrow I will hand all of them over to
Israel, slain. You are to hamstring their
horses and burn their chariots."
7So Joshua and his whole army came
against them suddenly at the Waters of
Merom and attacked them,
8and the Lord gave them into the hand
of Israel. They defeated them and
pursued them all the way to Greater
Sidon, to Misrephoth Maim, and to the
Valley of Mizpah on the east, until no
survivors were left.
9Joshua did to them as the Lord had
directed: He hamstrung their horses and
burned their chariots.
10At that time Joshua turned back and
captured Hazor and put its king to the
sword. (Hazor had been the head of all
these kingdoms.)
11Everyone in it they put to the sword.
They totally destroyed them, not sparing
anything that breathed, and he burned
up Hazor itself.
12Joshua took all these royal cities and
their kings and put them to the sword.
He totally destroyed them, as Moses the
servant of the Lord had commanded.
13Yet Israel did not burn any of the cities
built on their mounds-except Hazor,
which Joshua burned.
14The Israelites carried off for
themselves all the plunder and livestock
of these cities, but all the people they
put to the sword until they completely
destroyed them, not sparing anyone that
breathed.
15As the Lord commanded his servant
Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua,
and Joshua did it; he left nothing
undone of all that the Lord commanded
Moses.
16So Joshua took this entire land: the hill
country, all the Negev, the whole region
of Goshen, the western foothills, the
Arabah and the mountains of Israel with
their foothills,
17from Mount Halak, which rises toward
Seir, to Baal Gad in the Valley of
Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He
captured all their kings and struck them
down, putting them to death.
18Joshua waged war against all these
kings for a long time.
19Except for the Hivites living in Gibeon,
not one city made a treaty of peace with
the Israelites, who took them all in battle.
20For it was the Lord himself who
hardened their hearts to wage war
against Israel, so that he might destroy
them totally, exterminating them without
mercy, as the Lord had commanded
Moses.
21At that time Joshua went and
destroyed the Anakites from the hill
country: from Hebron, Debir and Anab,
from all the hill country of Judah, and
from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua
totally destroyed them and their towns.
22No Anakites were left in Israelite
territory; only in Gaza, Gath and Ashdod
did any survive.
23So Joshua took the entire land, just as
the Lord had directed Moses, and he
gave it as an inheritance to Israel
according to their tribal divisions. Then
the land had rest from war.
12These are the kings of the land
whom the Israelites had defeated and
whose territory they took over east of
the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge to
Mount Hermon, including all the eastern
side of the Arabah:
2Sihon king of the Amorites, who
reigned in Heshbon. He ruled from
Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorgefrom
the middle of the gorge-to the
Jabbok River, which is the border of the
Ammonites. This included half of Gilead.
3He also ruled over the eastern Arabah
from the Sea of Kinnereth to the Sea of
the Arabah (the Salt Sea ), to Beth
Jeshimoth, and then southward below
the slopes of Pisgah.
4And the territory of Og king of Bashan,
one of the last of the Rephaites, who
reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei.
5He ruled over Mount Hermon, Salecah,
all of Bashan to the border of the people
of Geshur and Maacah, and half of
Gilead to the border of Sihon king of
Heshbon.
6Moses, the servant of the Lord , and
the Israelites conquered them. And
Moses the servant of the Lord gave their
land to the Reubenites, the Gadites and
the half-tribe of Manasseh to be their
possession.
7These are the kings of the land that
Joshua and the Israelites conquered on
the west side of the Jordan, from Baal
Gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount
Halak, which rises toward Seir (their
lands Joshua gave as an inheritance to
the tribes of Israel according to their
tribal divisions-
8the hill country, the western foothills,
the Arabah, the mountain slopes, the
desert and the Negev-the lands of the
Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites,
Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites):
9the king of Jericho one the king of Ai
(near Bethel) one
10the king of Jerusalem one the king of
Hebronp one
11the king of Jarmuth one the king of
Lachish one
12the king of Eglon one the king of
Gezer one
13the king of Debir one the king of Geder
one
14the king of Hormah one the king of
Arad one
15the king of Libnah one the king of
Adullam one
16the king of Makkedah one the king of
Bethel one
17the king of Tappuah one the king of
Hepher one
18the king of Aphek one the king of
Lasharon one
19the king of Madon one the king of
Hazor one
20the king of Shimron Meron one the
king of Acshaph one
21the king of Taanach one the king of
Megiddo one
22the king of Kedesh one the king of
Jokneam in Carmel one
23the king of Dor (in Naphoth Dor ) one
the king of Goyim in Gilgal one
24the king of Tirzah one thirty-one kings
in all.
13When Joshua was old and well
advanced in years, the Lord said to him,
"You are very old, and there are still
very large areas of land to be taken over.
2"This is the land that remains: all the
regions of the Philistines and
Geshurites:
3from the Shihor River on the east of
Egypt to the territory of Ekron on the
north, all of it counted as Canaanite (the
territory of the five Philistine rulers in
Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath and
Ekron-that of the Avvites);
4from the south, all the land of the
Canaanites, from Arah of the Sidonians
as far as Aphek, the region of the
Amorites,
5the area of the Gebalites ; and all
Lebanon to the east, from Baal Gad
below Mount Hermon to Lebo Hamath.
6"As for all the inhabitants of the
mountain regions from Lebanon to
Misrephoth Maim, that is, all the
Sidonians, I myself will drive them out
before the Israelites. Be sure to allocate
this land to Israel for an inheritance, as I
have instructed you,
7and divide it as an inheritance among
the nine tribes and half of the tribe of
Manasseh."
8The other half of Manasseh, the
Reubenites and the Gadites had
received the inheritance that Moses had
given them east of the Jordan, as he,
the servant of the Lord , had assigned it
to them.
9It extended from Aroer on the rim of the
Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the
middle of the gorge, and included the
whole plateau of Medeba as far as
Dibon,
10and all the towns of Sihon king of the
Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, out to
the border of the Ammonites.
11It also included Gilead, the territory of
the people of Geshur and Maacah, all of
Mount Hermon and all Bashan as far as
Salecah-
12that is, the whole kingdom of Og in
Bashan, who had reigned in Ashtaroth
and Edrei and had survived as one of
the last of the Rephaites. Moses had
defeated them and taken over their land.
13But the Israelites did not drive out the
people of Geshur and Maacah, so they
continue to live among the Israelites to
this day.
14But to the tribe of Levi he gave no
inheritance, since the offerings made by
fire to the Lord , the God of Israel, are
their inheritance, as he promised them.
15This is what Moses had given to the
tribe of Reuben, clan by clan:
16The territory from Aroer on the rim of
the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in
the middle of the gorge, and the whole
plateau past Medeba
17to Heshbon and all its towns on the
plateau, including Dibon, Bamoth Baal,
Beth Baal Meon,
18Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,
19Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar on
the hill in the valley,
20Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and
Beth Jeshimoth
21-all the towns on the plateau and the
entire realm of Sihon king of the
Amorites, who ruled at Heshbon. Moses
had defeated him and the Midianite
chiefs, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Rebaprinces
allied with Sihon-who lived in
that country.
22In addition to those slain in battle, the
Israelites had put to the sword Balaam
son of Beor, who practiced divination.
23The boundary of the Reubenites was
the bank of the Jordan. These towns
and their villages were the inheritance of
the Reubenites, clan by clan.
24This is what Moses had given to the
tribe of Gad, clan by clan:
25The territory of Jazer, all the towns of
Gilead and half the Ammonite country
as far as Aroer, near Rabbah;
26and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah
and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the
territory of Debir;
27and in the valley, Beth Haram, Beth
Nimrah, Succoth and Zaphon with the
rest of the realm of Sihon king of
Heshbon (the east side of the Jordan,
the territory up to the end of the Sea of
Kinnereth ).
28These towns and their villages were
the inheritance of the Gadites, clan by
clan.
29This is what Moses had given to the
half-tribe of Manasseh, that is, to half
the family of the descendants of
Manasseh, clan by clan:
30The territory extending from Mahanaim
and including all of Bashan, the entire
realm of Og king of Bashan-all the
settlements of Jair in Bashan, sixty
towns,
31half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei
(the royal cities of Og in Bashan). This
was for the descendants of Makir son of
Manasseh-for half of the sons of Makir,
clan by clan.
32This is the inheritance Moses had
given when he was in the plains of
Moab across the Jordan east of Jericho.
33But to the tribe of Levi, Moses had
given no inheritance; the Lord , the God
of Israel, is their inheritance, as he
promised them.
14Now these are the areas the
Israelites received as an inheritance in
the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the
priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads
of the tribal clans of Israel allotted to
them.
2Their inheritances were assigned by lot
to the nine-and-a-half tribes, as the Lord
had commanded through Moses.
3Moses had granted the two-and-a-half
tribes their inheritance east of the
Jordan but had not granted the Levites
an inheritance among the rest,
4for the sons of Joseph had become two
tribes-Manasseh and Ephraim. The
Levites received no share of the land
but only towns to live in, with
pasturelands for their flocks and herds.
5So the Israelites divided the land, just
as the Lord had commanded Moses.
6Now the men of Judah approached
Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of
Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him,
"You know what the Lord said to Moses
the man of God at Kadesh Barnea about
you and me.
7I was forty years old when Moses the
servant of the Lord sent me from
Kadesh Barnea to explore the land. And
I brought him back a report according to
my convictions,
8but my brothers who went up with me
made the hearts of the people melt with
fear. I, however, followed the Lord my
God wholeheartedly.
9So on that day Moses swore to me,
'The land on which your feet have
walked will be your inheritance and that
of your children forever, because you
have followed the Lord my God
wholeheartedly.'
10"Now then, just as the Lord promised,
he has kept me alive for forty-five years
since the time he said this to Moses,
while Israel moved about in the desert.
So here I am today, eighty-five years
old!
11I am still as strong today as the day
Moses sent me out; I'm just as vigorous
to go out to battle now as I was then.
12Now give me this hill country that the
Lord promised me that day. You
yourself heard then that the Anakites
were there and their cities were large
and fortified, but, the Lord helping me, I
will drive them out just as he said."
13Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of
Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his
inheritance.
14So Hebron has belonged to Caleb son
of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since,
because he followed the Lord , the God
of Israel, wholeheartedly.
15(Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba
after Arba, who was the greatest man
among the Anakites.) Then the land had
rest from war.
15The allotment for the tribe of
Judah, clan by clan, extended down to
the territory of Edom, to the Desert of
Zin in the extreme south.
2Their southern boundary started from
the bay at the southern end of the Salt
Sea,
3crossed south of Scorpion Pass,
continued on to Zin and went over to the
south of Kadesh Barnea. Then it ran
past Hezron up to Addar and curved
around to Karka.
4It then passed along to Azmon and
joined the Wadi of Egypt, ending at the
sea. This is their southern boundary.
5The eastern boundary is the Salt Sea
as far as the mouth of the Jordan. The
northern boundary started from the bay
of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan,
6went up to Beth Hoglah and continued
north of Beth Arabah to the Stone of
Bohan son of Reuben.
7The boundary then went up to Debir
from the Valley of Achor and turned
north to Gilgal, which faces the Pass of
Adummim south of the gorge. It
continued along to the waters of En
Shemesh and came out at En Rogel.
8Then it ran up the Valley of Ben
Hinnom along the southern slope of the
Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem). From
there it climbed to the top of the hill west
of the Hinnom Valley at the northern end
of the Valley of Rephaim.
9From the hilltop the boundary headed
toward the spring of the waters of
Nephtoah, came out at the towns of
Mount Ephron and went down toward
Baalah (that is, Kiriath Jearim).
10Then it curved westward from Baalah
to Mount Seir, ran along the northern
slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Kesalon),
continued down to Beth Shemesh and
crossed to Timnah.
11It went to the northern slope of Ekron,
turned toward Shikkeron, passed along
to Mount Baalah and reached Jabneel.
The boundary ended at the sea.
12The western boundary is the coastline
of the Great Sea. These are the
boundaries around the people of Judah
by their clans.
13In accordance with the Lord 's
command to him, Joshua gave to Caleb
son of Jephunneh a portion in Judah-
Kiriath Arba, that is, Hebron. (Arba was
the forefather of Anak.)
14From Hebron Caleb drove out the
three Anakites-Sheshai, Ahiman and
Talmai-descendants of Anak.
15From there he marched against the
people living in Debir (formerly called
Kiriath Sepher).
16And Caleb said, "I will give my
daughter Acsah in marriage to the man
who attacks and captures Kiriath
Sepher."
17Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's brother,
took it; so Caleb gave his daughter
Acsah to him in marriage.
18One day when she came to Othniel,
she urged him to ask her father for a
field. When she got off her donkey,
Caleb asked her, "What can I do for
you?"
19She replied, "Do me a special favor.
Since you have given me land in the
Negev, give me also springs of water."
So Caleb gave her the upper and lower
springs.
20This is the inheritance of the tribe of
Judah, clan by clan:
21The southernmost towns of the tribe of
Judah in the Negev toward the
boundary of Edom were: Kabzeel, Eder,
Jagur,
22Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,
23Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,
24Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,

towns and their villages.
63Judah could not dislodge the Jebusites,
who were living in Jerusalem; to this day
the Jebusites live there with the people
of Judah.
16The allotment for Joseph began at
the Jordan of Jericho, east of the waters
of Jericho, and went up from there
through the desert into the hill country of
Bethel.
2It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz),
crossed over to the territory of the
Arkites in Ataroth,
3descended westward to the territory of
the Japhletites as far as the region of
Lower Beth Horon and on to Gezer,
ending at the sea.
4So Manasseh and Ephraim, the
descendants of Joseph, received their
inheritance.
5This was the territory of Ephraim, clan
by clan: The boundary of their
inheritance went from Ataroth Addar in
the east to Upper Beth Horon
6and continued to the sea. From
Micmethath on the north it curved
eastward to Taanath Shiloh, passing by
it to Janoah on the east.
7Then it went down from Janoah to
Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho
and came out at the Jordan.
8From Tappuah the border went west to
the Kanah Ravine and ended at the sea.
This was the inheritance of the tribe of
the Ephraimites, clan by clan.
9It also included all the towns and their
villages that were set aside for the
Ephraimites within the inheritance of the
Manassites.
10They did not dislodge the Canaanites
living in Gezer; to this day the
Canaanites live among the people of
Ephraim but are required to do forced
labor.
17This was the allotment for the tribe
of Manasseh as Joseph's firstborn, that
is, for Makir, Manasseh's firstborn. Makir
was the ancestor of the Gileadites, who
had received Gilead and Bashan
because the Makirites were great
soldiers.
2So this allotment was for the rest of the
people of Manasseh-the clans of
Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem,
Hepher and Shemida. These are the
other male descendants of Manasseh
son of Joseph by their clans.
3Now Zelophehad son of Hepher, the
son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son
of Manasseh, had no sons but only
daughters, whose names were Mahlah,
Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah.
4They went to Eleazar the priest, Joshua
son of Nun, and the leaders and said,
"The Lord commanded Moses to give us
an inheritance among our brothers." So
Joshua gave them an inheritance along
with the brothers of their father,
according to the Lord 's command.
5Manasseh's share consisted of ten
tracts of land besides Gilead and
Bashan east of the Jordan,
6because the daughters of the tribe of
Manasseh received an inheritance
among the sons. The land of Gilead
belonged to the rest of the descendants
of Manasseh.
7The territory of Manasseh extended
from Asher to Micmethath east of
Shechem. The boundary ran southward
from there to include the people living at
En Tappuah.
8(Manasseh had the land of Tappuah,
but Tappuah itself, on the boundary of
Manasseh, belonged to the
Ephraimites.)
9Then the boundary continued south to
the Kanah Ravine. There were towns
belonging to Ephraim lying among the
towns of Manasseh, but the boundary of
Manasseh was the northern side of the
ravine and ended at the sea.
10On the south the land belonged to
Ephraim, on the north to Manasseh. The
territory of Manasseh reached the sea
and bordered Asher on the north and
Issachar on the east.
11Within Issachar and Asher, Manasseh
also had Beth Shan, Ibleam and the
people of Dor, Endor, Taanach and
Megiddo, together with their surrounding
settlements (the third in the list is
Naphoth ).
12Yet the Manassites were not able to
occupy these towns, for the Canaanites
were determined to live in that region.
13However, when the Israelites grew
stronger, they subjected the Canaanites
to forced labor but did not drive them out
completely.
14The people of Joseph said to Joshua,
"Why have you given us only one
allotment and one portion for an
inheritance? We are a numerous people
and the Lord has blessed us
abundantly."
15"If you are so numerous," Joshua
answered, "and if the hill country of
Ephraim is too small for you, go up into
the forest and clear land for yourselves
there in the land of the Perizzites and
Rephaites."
16The people of Joseph replied, "The hill
country is not enough for us, and all the
Canaanites who live in the plain have
iron chariots, both those in Beth Shan
and its settlements and those in the
Valley of Jezreel."
17But Joshua said to the house of
Joseph-to Ephraim and Manasseh-"You
are numerous and very powerful. You
will have not only one allotment
18but the forested hill country as well.
Clear it, and its farthest limits will be
yours; though the Canaanites have iron
chariots and though they are strong, you
can drive them out."
18The whole assembly of the
Israelites gathered at Shiloh and set up
the Tent of Meeting there. The country
was brought under their control,
2but there were still seven Israelite tribes
who had not yet received their
inheritance.
3So Joshua said to the Israelites: "How
long will you wait before you begin to
take possession of the land that the
Lord , the God of your fathers, has given
you?
4Appoint three men from each tribe. I will
send them out to make a survey of the
land and to write a description of it,
according to the inheritance of each.
Then they will return to me.
5You are to divide the land into seven
parts. Judah is to remain in its territory
on the south and the house of Joseph in
its territory on the north.
6After you have written descriptions of
the seven parts of the land, bring them
here to me and I will cast lots for you in
the presence of the Lord our God.
7The Levites, however, do not get a
portion among you, because the priestly
service of the Lord is their inheritance.
And Gad, Reuben and the half-tribe of
Manasseh have already received their
inheritance on the east side of the
Jordan. Moses the servant of the Lord
gave it to them."
8As the men started on their way to map
out the land, Joshua instructed them,
"Go and make a survey of the land and
write a description of it. Then return to
me, and I will cast lots for you here at
Shiloh in the presence of the Lord ."
9So the men left and went through the
land. They wrote its description on a
scroll, town by town, in seven parts, and
returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh.
10Joshua then cast lots for them in
Shiloh in the presence of the Lord , and
there he distributed the land to the
Israelites according to their tribal
divisions.
11The lot came up for the tribe of
Benjamin, clan by clan. Their allotted
territory lay between the tribes of Judah
and Joseph:
12On the north side their boundary
began at the Jordan, passed the
northern slope of Jericho and headed
west into the hill country, coming out at
the desert of Beth Aven.
13From there it crossed to the south
slope of Luz (that is, Bethel) and went
down to Ataroth Addar on the hill south
of Lower Beth Horon.
14From the hill facing Beth Horon on the
south the boundary turned south along
the western side and came out at Kiriath
Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim), a town of
the people of Judah. This was the
western side.
15The southern side began at the
outskirts of Kiriath Jearim on the west,
and the boundary came out at the spring
of the waters of Nephtoah.
16The boundary went down to the foot of
the hill facing the Valley of Ben Hinnom,
north of the Valley of Rephaim. It
continued down the Hinnom Valley
along the southern slope of the Jebusite
city and so to En Rogel.
17It then curved north, went to En
Shemesh, continued to Geliloth, which
faces the Pass of Adummim, and ran
down to the Stone of Bohan son of
Reuben.
18It continued to the northern slope of
Beth Arabah and on down into the
Arabah.
19It then went to the northern slope of
Beth Hoglah and came out at the
northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the
mouth of the Jordan in the south. This
was the southern boundary.
20The Jordan formed the boundary on
the eastern side. These were the
boundaries that marked out the
inheritance of the clans of Benjamin on
all sides.
21The tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan,
had the following cities: Jericho, Beth
Hoglah, Emek Keziz,
22Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,
23Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,
24Kephar Ammoni, Ophni and Gebatwelve
towns and their villages.
25Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,
26Mizpah, Kephirah, Mozah,
27Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,
28Zelah, Haeleph, the Jebusite city (that
is, Jerusalem), Gibeah and Kiriathfourteen
towns and their villages. This
was the inheritance of Benjamin for its
clans.
19The second lot came out for the
tribe of Simeon, clan by clan. Their
inheritance lay within the territory of
Judah.
2It included: Beersheba (or Sheba),
Moladah,
3Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem,
4Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah,
5Ziklag, Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susah,
6Beth Lebaoth and Sharuhen-thirteen
towns and their villages;
7Ain, Rimmon, Ether and Ashan-four
towns and their villages8and
all the villages around these towns
as far as Baalath Beer (Ramah in the
Negev). This was the inheritance of the
tribe of the Simeonites, clan by clan.
9The inheritance of the Simeonites was
taken from the share of Judah, because
Judah's portion was more than they
needed. So the Simeonites received
their inheritance within the territory of
Judah.
10The third lot came up for Zebulun, clan
by clan: The boundary of their
inheritance went as far as Sarid.
11Going west it ran to Maralah, touched
Dabbesheth, and extended to the ravine
near Jokneam.
12It turned east from Sarid toward the
sunrise to the territory of Kisloth Tabor
and went on to Daberath and up to
Japhia.
13Then it continued eastward to Gath
Hepher and Eth Kazin; it came out at
Rimmon and turned toward Neah.
14There the boundary went around on
the north to Hannathon and ended at
the Valley of Iphtah El.
15Included were Kattath, Nahalal,
Shimron, Idalah and Bethlehem. There
were twelve towns and their villages.
16These towns and their villages were
the inheritance of Zebulun, clan by clan.
17The fourth lot came out for Issachar,
clan by clan.
18Their territory included: Jezreel,
Kesulloth, Shunem,
19Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath,
20Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez,
21Remeth, En Gannim, En Haddah and
Beth Pazzez.
22The boundary touched Tabor,
Shahazumah and Beth Shemesh, and
ended at the Jordan. There were sixteen
towns and their villages.
23These towns and their villages were
the inheritance of the tribe of Issachar,
clan by clan.
24The fifth lot came out for the tribe of
Asher, clan by clan.
25Their territory included: Helkath, Hali,
Beten, Acshaph,
26Allammelech, Amad and Mishal. On
the west the boundary touched Carmel
and Shihor Libnath.
27It then turned east toward Beth Dagon,
touched Zebulun and the Valley of
Iphtah El, and went north to Beth Emek
and Neiel, passing Cabul on the left.
28It went to Abdon, Rehob, Hammon
and Kanah, as far as Greater Sidon.
29The boundary then turned back toward
Ramah and went to the fortified city of
Tyre, turned toward Hosah and came
out at the sea in the region of Aczib,
30Ummah, Aphek and Rehob. There
were twenty-two towns and their villages.
31These towns and their villages were
the inheritance of the tribe of Asher, clan
by clan.
32The sixth lot came out for Naphtali,
clan by clan:
33Their boundary went from Heleph and
the large tree in Zaanannim, passing
Adami Nekeb and Jabneel to Lakkum
and ending at the Jordan.
34The boundary ran west through
Aznoth Tabor and came out at Hukkok.
It touched Zebulun on the south, Asher
on the west and the Jordan on the east.
35The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer,
Hammath, Rakkath, Kinnereth,
36Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,
37Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor,
38Iron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath
and Beth Shemesh. There were
nineteen towns and their villages.
39These towns and their villages were
the inheritance of the tribe of Naphtali,
clan by clan.
40The seventh lot came out for the tribe
of Dan, clan by clan.
41The territory of their inheritance
included: Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir Shemesh,
42Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah,
43Elon, Timnah, Ekron,
44Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,
45Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon,
46Me Jarkon and Rakkon, with the area
facing Joppa.
47(But the Danites had difficulty taking
possession of their territory, so they
went up and attacked Leshem, took it,
put it to the sword and occupied it. They
settled in Leshem and named it Dan
after their forefather.)
48These towns and their villages were
the inheritance of the tribe of Dan, clan
by clan.
49When they had finished dividing the
land into its allotted portions, the
Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun an
inheritance among them,
50as the Lord had commanded. They
gave him the town he asked for-Timnath
Serah in the hill country of Ephraim. And
he built up the town and settled there.
51These are the territories that Eleazar
the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the
heads of the tribal clans of Israel
assigned by lot at Shiloh in the presence
of the Lord at the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting. And so they finished dividing
the land.
20Then the Lord said to Joshua:
2"Tell the Israelites to designate the
cities of refuge, as I instructed you
through Moses,
3so that anyone who kills a person
accidentally and unintentionally may flee
there and find protection from the
avenger of blood.
4"When he flees to one of these cities,
he is to stand in the entrance of the city
gate and state his case before the
elders of that city. Then they are to
admit him into their city and give him a
place to live with them.
5If the avenger of blood pursues him,
they must not surrender the one
accused, because he killed his neighbor
unintentionally and without malice
aforethought.
6He is to stay in that city until he has
stood trial before the assembly and until
the death of the high priest who is
serving at that time. Then he may go
back to his own home in the town from
which he fled."
7So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in
the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in
the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath
Arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country
of Judah.
8On the east side of the Jordan of
Jericho they designated Bezer in the
desert on the plateau in the tribe of
Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead in the tribe of
Gad, and Golan in Bashan in the tribe of
Manasseh.
9Any of the Israelites or any alien living
among them who killed someone
accidentally could flee to these
designated cities and not be killed by
the avenger of blood prior to standing
trial before the assembly.
21Now the family heads of the
Levites approached Eleazar the priest,
Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of
the other tribal families of Israel
2at Shiloh in Canaan and said to them,
"The Lord commanded through Moses
that you give us towns to live in, with
pasturelands for our livestock."
3So, as the Lord had commanded, the
Israelites gave the Levites the following
towns and pasturelands out of their own
inheritance:
4The first lot came out for the Kohathites,
clan by clan. The Levites who were
descendants of Aaron the priest were
allotted thirteen towns from the tribes of
Judah, Simeon and Benjamin.
5The rest of Kohath's descendants were
allotted ten towns from the clans of the
tribes of Ephraim, Dan and half of
Manasseh.
6The descendants of Gershon were
allotted thirteen towns from the clans of
the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali
and the half-tribe of Manasseh in
Bashan.
7The descendants of Merari, clan by
clan, received twelve towns from the
tribes of Reuben, Gad and Zebulun.
8So the Israelites allotted to the Levites
these towns and their pasturelands, as
the Lord had commanded through
Moses.
9From the tribes of Judah and Simeon
they allotted the following towns by
name
10(these towns were assigned to the
descendants of Aaron who were from
the Kohathite clans of the Levites,
because the first lot fell to them):
11They gave them Kiriath Arba (that is,
Hebron), with its surrounding
pastureland, in the hill country of Judah.
(Arba was the forefather of Anak.)
12But the fields and villages around the
city they had given to Caleb son of
Jephunneh as his possession.
13So to the descendants of Aaron the
priest they gave Hebron (a city of refuge
for one accused of murder), Libnah,
14Jattir, Eshtemoa,
15Holon, Debir,
16Ain, Juttah and Beth Shemesh,
together with their pasturelands-nine
towns from these two tribes.
17And from the tribe of Benjamin they
gave them Gibeon, Geba,
18Anathoth and Almon, together with
their pasturelands-four towns.
19All the towns for the priests, the
descendants of Aaron, were thirteen,
together with their pasturelands.
20The rest of the Kohathite clans of the
Levites were allotted towns from the
tribe of Ephraim:
21In the hill country of Ephraim they
were given Shechem (a city of refuge for
one accused of murder) and Gezer,
22Kibzaim and Beth Horon, together with
their pasturelands-four towns.
23Also from the tribe of Dan they
received Eltekeh, Gibbethon,
24Aijalon and Gath Rimmon, together
with their pasturelands-four towns.
25From half the tribe of Manasseh they
received Taanach and Gath Rimmon,
together with their pasturelands-two
towns.
26All these ten towns and their
pasturelands were given to the rest of
the Kohathite clans.
27The Levite clans of the Gershonites
were given: from the half-tribe of
Manasseh, Golan in Bashan (a city of
refuge for one accused of murder) and
Be Eshtarah, together with their
pasturelands-two towns;
28from the tribe of Issachar, Kishion,
Daberath,
29Jarmuth and En Gannim, together with
their pasturelands-four towns;
30from the tribe of Asher, Mishal, Abdon,
31Helkath and Rehob, together with their
pasturelands-four towns;
32from the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in
Galilee (a city of refuge for one accused
of murder), Hammoth Dor and Kartan,
together with their pasturelands-three
towns.
33All the towns of the Gershonite clans
were thirteen, together with their
pasturelands.
34The Merarite clans (the rest of the
Levites) were given: from the tribe of
Zebulun, Jokneam, Kartah,
35Dimnah and Nahalal, together with
their pasturelands-four towns;
36from the tribe of Reuben, Bezer, Jahaz,
37Kedemoth and Mephaath, together
with their pasturelands-four towns;
38from the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in
Gilead (a city of refuge for one accused
of murder), Mahanaim,
39Heshbon and Jazer, together with their
pasturelands-four towns in all.
40All the towns allotted to the Merarite
clans, who were the rest of the Levites,
were twelve.
41The towns of the Levites in the territory
held by the Israelites were forty-eight in
all, together with their pasturelands.
42Each of these towns had pasturelands
surrounding it; this was true for all these
towns.
43So the Lord gave Israel all the land he
had sworn to give their forefathers, and
they took possession of it and settled
there.
44The Lord gave them rest on every side,
just as he had sworn to their forefathers.
Not one of their enemies withstood
them; the Lord handed all their enemies
over to them.
45Not one of all the Lord 's good
promises to the house of Israel failed;
every one was fulfilled.
22Then Joshua summoned the
Reubenites, the Gadites and the halftribe
of Manasseh
2and said to them, "You have done all
that Moses the servant of the Lord
commanded, and you have obeyed me
in everything I commanded.
3For a long time now-to this very dayyou
have not deserted your brothers but
have carried out the mission the Lord
your God gave you.
4Now that the Lord your God has given
your brothers rest as he promised,
return to your homes in the land that
Moses the servant of the Lord gave you
on the other side of the Jordan.
5But be very careful to keep the
commandment and the law that Moses
the servant of the Lord gave you: to love
the Lord your God, to walk in all his
ways, to obey his commands, to hold
fast to him and to serve him with all your
heart and all your soul."
6Then Joshua blessed them and sent
them away, and they went to their
homes.
7(To the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses
had given land in Bashan, and to the
other half of the tribe Joshua gave land
on the west side of the Jordan with their
brothers.) When Joshua sent them
home, he blessed them,
8saying, "Return to your homes with
your great wealth-with large herds of
livestock, with silver, gold, bronze and
iron, and a great quantity of clothing-and
divide with your brothers the plunder
from your enemies."
9So the Reubenites, the Gadites and the
half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites
at Shiloh in Canaan to return to Gilead,
their own land, which they had acquired
in accordance with the command of the
Lord through Moses.
10When they came to Geliloth near the
Jordan in the land of Canaan, the
Reubenites, the Gadites and the halftribe
of Manasseh built an imposing altar
there by the Jordan.
11And when the Israelites heard that
they had built the altar on the border of
Canaan at Geliloth near the Jordan on
the Israelite side,
12the whole assembly of Israel gathered
at Shiloh to go to war against them.
13So the Israelites sent Phinehas son of
Eleazar, the priest, to the land of Gileadto
Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of
Manasseh.
14With him they sent ten of the chief
men, one for each of the tribes of Israel,
each the head of a family division
among the Israelite clans.
15When they went to Gilead-to Reuben,
Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh-they
said to them:
16"The whole assembly of the Lord says:
'How could you break faith with the God
of Israel like this? How could you turn
away from the Lord and build yourselves
an altar in rebellion against him now?
17Was not the sin of Peor enough for
us? Up to this very day we have not
cleansed ourselves from that sin, even
though a plague fell on the community
of the Lord !
18And are you now turning away from
the Lord ? " 'If you rebel against the
Lord today, tomorrow he will be angry
with the whole community of Israel.
19If the land you possess is defiled,
come over to the Lord 's land, where the
Lord 's tabernacle stands, and share the
land with us. But do not rebel against
the Lord or against us by building an
altar for yourselves, other than the altar
of the Lord our God.
20When Achan son of Zerah acted
unfaithfully regarding the devoted things,
did not wrath come upon the whole
community of Israel? He was not the
only one who died for his sin.' "
21Then Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe
of Manasseh replied to the heads of the
clans of Israel:
22"The Mighty One, God, the Lord ! The
Mighty One, God, the Lord ! He knows!
And let Israel know! If this has been in
rebellion or disobedience to the Lord ,
do not spare us this day.
23If we have built our own altar to turn
away from the Lord and to offer burnt
offerings and grain offerings, or to
sacrifice fellowship offerings on it, may
the Lord himself call us to account.
24"No! We did it for fear that some day
your descendants might say to ours,
'What do you have to do with the Lord ,
the God of Israel?
25The Lord has made the Jordan a
boundary between us and you-you
Reubenites and Gadites! You have no
share in the Lord .' So your descendants
might cause ours to stop fearing the
Lord .
26"That is why we said, 'Let us get ready
and build an altar-but not for burnt
offerings or sacrifices.'
27On the contrary, it is to be a witness
between us and you and the
generations that follow, that we will
worship the Lord at his sanctuary with
our burnt offerings, sacrifices and
fellowship offerings. Then in the future
your descendants will not be able to say
to ours, 'You have no share in the Lord .'
28"And we said, 'If they ever say this to
us, or to our descendants, we will
answer: Look at the replica of the Lord 's
altar, which our fathers built, not for
burnt offerings and sacrifices, but as a
witness between us and you.'
29"Far be it from us to rebel against the
Lord and turn away from him today by
building an altar for burnt offerings, grain
offerings and sacrifices, other than the
altar of the Lord our God that stands
before his tabernacle."
30When Phinehas the priest and the
leaders of the community-the heads of
the clans of the Israelites-heard what
Reuben, Gad and Manasseh had to say,
they were pleased.
31And Phinehas son of Eleazar, the
priest, said to Reuben, Gad and
Manasseh, "Today we know that the
Lord is with us, because you have not
acted unfaithfully toward the Lord in this
matter. Now you have rescued the
Israelites from the Lord 's hand."
32Then Phinehas son of Eleazar, the
priest, and the leaders returned to
Canaan from their meeting with the
Reubenites and Gadites in Gilead and
reported to the Israelites.
33They were glad to hear the report and
praised God. And they talked no more
about going to war against them to
devastate the country where the
Reubenites and the Gadites lived.
34And the Reubenites and the Gadites
gave the altar this name: A Witness
Between Us that the Lord is God.
23After a long time had passed and
the Lord had given Israel rest from all
their enemies around them, Joshua, by
then old and well advanced in years,
2summoned all Israel-their elders,
leaders, judges and officials-and said to
them: "I am old and well advanced in
years.
3You yourselves have seen everything
the Lord your God has done to all these
nations for your sake; it was the Lord
your God who fought for you.
4Remember how I have allotted as an
inheritance for your tribes all the land of
the nations that remain-the nations I
conquered-between the Jordan and the
Great Sea in the west.
5The Lord your God himself will drive
them out of your way. He will push them
out before you, and you will take
possession of their land, as the Lord
your God promised you.
6"Be very strong; be careful to obey all
that is written in the Book of the Law of
Moses, without turning aside to the right
or to the left.
7Do not associate with these nations
that remain among you; do not invoke
the names of their gods or swear by
them. You must not serve them or bow
down to them.
8But you are to hold fast to the Lord your
God, as you have until now.
9"The Lord has driven out before you
great and powerful nations; to this day
no one has been able to withstand you.
10One of you routs a thousand, because
the Lord your God fights for you, just as
he promised.
11So be very careful to love the Lord
your God.
12"But if you turn away and ally
yourselves with the survivors of these
nations that remain among you and if
you intermarry with them and associate
with them,
13then you may be sure that the Lord
your God will no longer drive out these
nations before you. Instead, they will
become snares and traps for you, whips
on your backs and thorns in your eyes,
until you perish from this good land,
which the Lord your God has given you.
14"Now I am about to go the way of all
the earth. You know with all your heart
and soul that not one of all the good
promises the Lord your God gave you
has failed. Every promise has been
fulfilled; not one has failed.
15But just as every good promise of the
Lord your God has come true, so the
Lord will bring on you all the evil he has
threatened, until he has destroyed you
from this good land he has given you.
16If you violate the covenant of the Lord
your God, which he commanded you,
and go and serve other gods and bow
down to them, the Lord 's anger will burn
against you, and you will quickly perish
from the good land he has given you."
24Then Joshua assembled all the
tribes of Israel at Shechem. He
summoned the elders, leaders, judges
and officials of Israel, and they
presented themselves before God.
2Joshua said to all the people, "This is
what the Lord , the God of Israel, says:
'Long ago your forefathers, including
Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor,
lived beyond the River and worshiped
other gods.
3But I took your father Abraham from the
land beyond the River and led him
throughout Canaan and gave him many
descendants. I gave him Isaac,
4and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I
assigned the hill country of Seir to Esau,
but Jacob and his sons went down to
Egypt.
5" 'Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I
afflicted the Egyptians by what I did
there, and I brought you out.
6When I brought your fathers out of
Egypt, you came to the sea, and the
Egyptians pursued them with chariots
and horsemen as far as the Red Sea.
7But they cried to the Lord for help, and
he put darkness between you and the
Egyptians; he brought the sea over
them and covered them. You saw with
your own eyes what I did to the
Egyptians. Then you lived in the desert
for a long time.
8" 'I brought you to the land of the
Amorites who lived east of the Jordan.
They fought against you, but I gave
them into your hands. I destroyed them
from before you, and you took
possession of their land.
9When Balak son of Zippor, the king of
Moab, prepared to fight against Israel,
he sent for Balaam son of Beor to put a
curse on you.
10But I would not listen to Balaam, so he
blessed you again and again, and I
delivered you out of his hand.
11" 'Then you crossed the Jordan and
came to Jericho. The citizens of Jericho
fought against you, as did also the
Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites,
Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and
Jebusites, but I gave them into your
hands.
12I sent the hornet ahead of you, which
drove them out before you-also the two
Amorite kings. You did not do it with
your own sword and bow.
13So I gave you a land on which you did
not toil and cities you did not build; and
you live in them and eat from vineyards
and olive groves that you did not plant.'
14"Now fear the Lord and serve him with
all faithfulness. Throw away the gods
your forefathers worshiped beyond the
River and in Egypt, and serve the Lord .
15But if serving the Lord seems
undesirable to you, then choose for
yourselves this day whom you will serve,
whether the gods your forefathers
served beyond the River, or the gods of
the Amorites, in whose land you are
living. But as for me and my household,
we will serve the Lord ."
16Then the people answered, "Far be it
from us to forsake the Lord to serve
other gods!
17It was the Lord our God himself who
brought us and our fathers up out of
Egypt, from that land of slavery, and
performed those great signs before our
eyes. He protected us on our entire
journey and among all the nations
through which we traveled.
18And the Lord drove out before us all
the nations, including the Amorites, who
lived in the land. We too will serve the
Lord , because he is our God."
19Joshua said to the people, "You are
not able to serve the Lord . He is a holy
God; he is a jealous God. He will not
forgive your rebellion and your sins.
20If you forsake the Lord and serve
foreign gods, he will turn and bring
disaster on you and make an end of you,
after he has been good to you."
21But the people said to Joshua, "No!
We will serve the Lord ."
22Then Joshua said, "You are witnesses
against yourselves that you have
chosen to serve the Lord ." "Yes, we are
witnesses," they replied.
23"Now then," said Joshua, "throw away
the foreign gods that are among you
and yield your hearts to the Lord , the
God of Israel."
24And the people said to Joshua, "We
will serve the Lord our God and obey
him."
25On that day Joshua made a covenant
for the people, and there at Shechem he
drew up for them decrees and laws.
26And Joshua recorded these things in
the Book of the Law of God. Then he
took a large stone and set it up there
under the oak near the holy place of the
Lord .
27"See!" he said to all the people. "This
stone will be a witness against us. It has
heard all the words the Lord has said to
us. It will be a witness against you if you
are untrue to your God."
28Then Joshua sent the people away,
each to his own inheritance.
29After these things, Joshua son of Nun,
the servant of the Lord , died at the age
of a hundred and ten.
30And they buried him in the land of his
inheritance, at Timnath Serah in the hill
country of Ephraim, north of Mount
Gaash.
31Israel served the Lord throughout the
lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who
outlived him and who had experienced
everything the Lord had done for Israel.
32And Joseph's bones, which the
Israelites had brought up from Egypt,
were buried at Shechem in the tract of
land that Jacob bought for a hundred
pieces of silver from the sons of Hamor,
the father of Shechem. This became the
inheritance of Joseph's descendants.
33And Eleazar son of Aaron died and
was buried at Gibeah, which had been
allotted to his son Phinehas in the hill
country of Ephraim.
Judges
1After the death of Joshua, the
Israelites asked the LORD , "Who will be
the first to go up and fight for us against
the Canaanites?"
2The LORD answered, "Judah is to go; I
have given the land into their hands."
3Then the men of Judah said to the
Simeonites their brothers, "Come up
with us into the territory allotted to us, to
fight against the Canaanites. We in turn
will go with you into yours." So the
Simeonites went with them.
4When Judah attacked, the LORD gave
the Canaanites and Perizzites into their
hands and they struck down ten
thousand men at Bezek.
5It was there that they found Adoni-
Bezek and fought against him, putting to
rout the Canaanites and Perizzites.
6Adoni-Bezek fled, but they chased him
and caught him, and cut off his thumbs
and big toes.
7Then Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy kings
with their thumbs and big toes cut off
have picked up scraps under my table.
Now God has paid me back for what I
did to them." They brought him to
Jerusalem, and he died there.
8The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem
also and took it. They put the city to the
sword and set it on fire.
9After that, the men of Judah went down
to fight against the Canaanites living in
the hill country, the Negev and the
western foothills.
10They advanced against the
Canaanites living in Hebron (formerly
called Kiriath Arba) and defeated
Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai.
11From there they advanced against the
people living in Debir (formerly called
Kiriath Sepher).
12And Caleb said, "I will give my
daughter Acsah in marriage to the man
who attacks and captures Kiriath
Sepher."
13Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger
brother, took it; so Caleb gave his
daughter Acsah to him in marriage.
14One day when she came to Othniel,
she urged him to ask her father for a
field. When she got off her donkey,
Caleb asked her, "What can I do for
you?"
15She replied, "Do me a special favor.
Since you have given me land in the
Negev, give me also springs of water."
Then Caleb gave her the upper and
lower springs.
16The descendants of Moses' father-inlaw,
the Kenite, went up from the City of
Palms with the men of Judah to live
among the people of the Desert of
Judah in the Negev near Arad.
17Then the men of Judah went with the
Simeonites their brothers and attacked
the Canaanites living in Zephath, and
they totally destroyed the city. Therefore
it was called Hormah.
18The men of Judah also took Gaza,
Ashkelon and Ekron-each city with its
territory.
19The LORD was with the men of Judah.
They took possession of the hill country,
but they were unable to drive the people
from the plains, because they had iron
chariots.
20As Moses had promised, Hebron was
given to Caleb, who drove from it the
three sons of Anak.
21The Benjamites, however, failed to
dislodge the Jebusites, who were living
in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites
live there with the Benjamites.
22Now the house of Joseph attacked
Bethel, and the LORD was with them.
23When they sent men to spy out Bethel
(formerly called Luz),
24the spies saw a man coming out of the
city and they said to him, "Show us how
to get into the city and we will see that
you are treated well."
25So he showed them, and they put the
city to the sword but spared the man
and his whole family.
26He then went to the land of the Hittites,
where he built a city and called it Luz,
which is its name to this day.
27But Manasseh did not drive out the
people of Beth Shan or Taanach or Dor
or Ibleam or Megiddo and their
surrounding settlements, for the
Canaanites were determined to live in
that land.
28When Israel became strong, they
pressed the Canaanites into forced
labor but never drove them out
completely.
29Nor did Ephraim drive out the
Canaanites living in Gezer, but the
Canaanites continued to live there
among them.
30Neither did Zebulun drive out the
Canaanites living in Kitron or Nahalol,
who remained among them; but they did
subject them to forced labor.
31Nor did Asher drive out those living in
Acco or Sidon or Ahlab or Aczib or
Helbah or Aphek or Rehob,
32and because of this the people of
Asher lived among the Canaanite
inhabitants of the land.
33Neither did Naphtali drive out those
living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath;
but the Naphtalites too lived among the
Canaanite inhabitants of the land, and
those living in Beth Shemesh and Beth
Anath became forced laborers for them.
34The Amorites confined the Danites to
the hill country, not allowing them to
come down into the plain.
35And the Amorites were determined
also to hold out in Mount Heres, Aijalon
and Shaalbim, but when the power of
the house of Joseph increased, they too
were pressed into forced labor.
36The boundary of the Amorites was
from Scorpion Pass to Sela and beyond.
2The angel of the LORD went up from
Gilgal to Bokim and said, "I brought you
up out of Egypt and led you into the land
that I swore to give to your forefathers. I
said, 'I will never break my covenant
with you,
2and you shall not make a covenant with
the people of this land, but you shall
break down their altars.' Yet you have
disobeyed me. Why have you done
this?
3Now therefore I tell you that I will not
drive them out before you; they will be
thorns in your sides and their gods will
be a snare to you."
4When the angel of the LORD had
spoken these things to all the Israelites,
the people wept aloud,
5and they called that place Bokim. There
they offered sacrifices to the LORD .
6After Joshua had dismissed the
Israelites, they went to take possession
of the land, each to his own inheritance.
7The people served the LORD
throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of
the elders who outlived him and who
had seen all the great things the LORD
had done for Israel.
8Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the
LORD , died at the age of a hundred
and ten.
9And they buried him in the land of his
inheritance, at Timnath Heres in the hill
country of Ephraim, north of Mount
Gaash.
10After that whole generation had been
gathered to their fathers, another
generation grew up, who knew neither
the LORD nor what he had done for
Israel.
11Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes
of the LORD and served the Baals.
12They forsook the LORD , the God of
their fathers, who had brought them out
of Egypt. They followed and worshiped
various gods of the peoples around
them. They provoked the LORD to
anger
13because they forsook him and served
Baal and the Ashtoreths.
14In his anger against Israel the LORD
handed them over to raiders who
plundered them. He sold them to their
enemies all around, whom they were no
longer able to resist.
15Whenever Israel went out to fight, the
hand of the LORD was against them to
defeat them, just as he had sworn to
them. They were in great distress.
16Then the LORD raised up judges, who
saved them out of the hands of these
raiders.
17Yet they would not listen to their
judges but prostituted themselves to
other gods and worshiped them. Unlike
their fathers, they quickly turned from
the way in which their fathers had
walked, the way of obedience to the
LORD 's commands.
18Whenever the LORD raised up a judge
for them, he was with the judge and
saved them out of the hands of their
enemies as long as the judge lived; for
the LORD had compassion on them as
they groaned under those who
oppressed and afflicted them.
19But when the judge died, the people
returned to ways even more corrupt
than those of their fathers, following
other gods and serving and worshiping
them. They refused to give up their evil
practices and stubborn ways.
20Therefore the LORD was very angry
with Israel and said, "Because this
nation has violated the covenant that I
laid down for their forefathers and has
not listened to me,
21I will no longer drive out before them
any of the nations Joshua left when he
died.
22I will use them to test Israel and see
whether they will keep the way of the
LORD and walk in it as their forefathers
did."
23The LORD had allowed those nations
to remain; he did not drive them out at
once by giving them into the hands of
Joshua.
3These are the nations the LORD left
to test all those Israelites who had not
experienced any of the wars in Canaan
2(he did this only to teach warfare to the
descendants of the Israelites who had
not had previous battle experience):
3the five rulers of the Philistines, all the
Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the
Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains
from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo
Hamath.
4They were left to test the Israelites to
see whether they would obey the LORD
's commands, which he had given their
forefathers through Moses.
5The Israelites lived among the
Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites,
Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
6They took their daughters in marriage
and gave their own daughters to their
sons, and served their gods.
7The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the
LORD ; they forgot the LORD their God
and served the Baals and the Asherahs.
8The anger of the LORD burned against
Israel so that he sold them into the
hands of Cushan-Rishathaim king of
Aram Naharaim, to whom the Israelites
were subject for eight years.
9But when they cried out to the LORD ,
he raised up for them a deliverer,
Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger
brother, who saved them.
10The Spirit of the LORD came upon him,
so that he became Israel's judge and
went to war. The LORD gave Cushan-
Rishathaim king of Aram into the hands
of Othniel, who overpowered him.
11So the land had peace for forty years,
until Othniel son of Kenaz died.
12Once again the Israelites did evil in the
eyes of the LORD , and because they
did this evil the LORD gave Eglon king
of Moab power over Israel.
13Getting the Ammonites and
Amalekites to join him, Eglon came and
attacked Israel, and they took
possession of the City of Palms.
14The Israelites were subject to Eglon
king of Moab for eighteen years.
15Again the Israelites cried out to the
LORD , and he gave them a deliverer-
Ehud, a left-handed man, the son of
Gera the Benjamite. The Israelites sent
him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab.
16Now Ehud had made a double-edged
sword about a foot and a half long,
which he strapped to his right thigh
under his clothing.
17He presented the tribute to Eglon king
of Moab, who was a very fat man.
18After Ehud had presented the tribute,
he sent on their way the men who had
carried it.
19At the idols near Gilgal he himself
turned back and said, "I have a secret
message for you, O king." The king said,
"Quiet!" And all his attendants left him.
20Ehud then approached him while he
was sitting alone in the upper room of
his summer palace and said, "I have a
message from God for you." As the king
rose from his seat,
21Ehud reached with his left hand, drew
the sword from his right thigh and
plunged it into the king's belly.
22Even the handle sank in after the
blade, which came out his back. Ehud
did not pull the sword out, and the fat
closed in over it.
23Then Ehud went out to the porch ; he
shut the doors of the upper room behind
him and locked them.
24After he had gone, the servants came
and found the doors of the upper room
locked. They said, "He must be relieving
himself in the inner room of the house."
25They waited to the point of
embarrassment, but when he did not
open the doors of the room, they took a
key and unlocked them. There they saw
their Lord fallen to the floor, dead.
26While they waited, Ehud got away. He
passed by the idols and escaped to
Seirah.
27When he arrived there, he blew a
trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim,
and the Israelites went down with him
from the hills, with him leading them.
28"Follow me," he ordered, "for the
LORD has given Moab, your enemy,
into your hands." So they followed him
down and, taking possession of the
fords of the Jordan that led to Moab,
they allowed no one to cross over.
29At that time they struck down about
ten thousand Moabites, all vigorous and
strong; not a man escaped.
30That day Moab was made subject to
Israel, and the land had peace for eighty
years.
31After Ehud came Shamgar son of
Anath, who struck down six hundred
Philistines with an oxgoad. He too saved
Israel.
4After Ehud died, the Israelites once
again did evil in the eyes of the LORD .
2So the LORD sold them into the hands
of Jabin, a king of Canaan, who reigned
in Hazor. The commander of his army
was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth
Haggoyim.
3Because he had nine hundred iron
chariots and had cruelly oppressed the
Israelites for twenty years, they cried to
the LORD for help.
4Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of
Lappidoth, was leading Israel at that
time.
5She held court under the Palm of
Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in
the hill country of Ephraim, and the
Israelites came to her to have their
disputes decided.
6She sent for Barak son of Abinoam
from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him,
"The LORD , the God of Israel,
commands you: 'Go, take with you ten
thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun
and lead the way to Mount Tabor.
7I will lure Sisera, the commander of
Jabin's army, with his chariots and his
troops to the Kishon River and give him
into your hands.' "
8Barak said to her, "If you go with me, I
will go; but if you don't go with me, I
won't go."
9"Very well," Deborah said, "I will go with
you. But because of the way you are
going about this, the honor will not be
yours, for the LORD will hand Sisera
over to a woman." So Deborah went
with Barak to Kedesh,
10where he summoned Zebulun and
Naphtali. Ten thousand men followed
him, and Deborah also went with him.
11Now Heber the Kenite had left the
other Kenites, the descendants of
Hobab, Moses' brother-in-law, and
pitched his tent by the great tree in
Zaanannim near Kedesh.
12When they told Sisera that Barak son
of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,
13Sisera gathered together his nine
hundred iron chariots and all the men
with him, from Harosheth Haggoyim to
the Kishon River.
14Then Deborah said to Barak, "Go! This
is the day the LORD has given Sisera
into your hands. Has not the LORD
gone ahead of you?" So Barak went
down Mount Tabor, followed by ten
thousand men.
15At Barak's advance, the LORD routed
Sisera and all his chariots and army by
the sword, and Sisera abandoned his
chariot and fled on foot.
16But Barak pursued the chariots and
army as far as Harosheth Haggoyim. All
the troops of Sisera fell by the sword;
not a man was left.
17Sisera, however, fled on foot to the
tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite,
because there were friendly relations
between Jabin king of Hazor and the
clan of Heber the Kenite.
18Jael went out to meet Sisera and said
to him, "Come, my Lord , come right in.
Don't be afraid." So he entered her tent,
and she put a covering over him.
19"I'm thirsty," he said. "Please give me
some water." She opened a skin of milk,
gave him a drink, and covered him up.
20"Stand in the doorway of the tent," he
told her. "If someone comes by and
asks you, 'Is anyone here?' say 'No.' "
21But Jael, Heber's wife, picked up a tent
peg and a hammer and went quietly to
him while he lay fast asleep, exhausted.
She drove the peg through his temple
into the ground, and he died.
22Barak came by in pursuit of Sisera,
and Jael went out to meet him. "Come,"
she said, "I will show you the man you're
looking for." So he went in with her, and
there lay Sisera with the tent peg
through his temple-dead.
23On that day God subdued Jabin, the
Canaanite king, before the Israelites.
24And the hand of the Israelites grew
stronger and stronger against Jabin, the
Canaanite king, until they destroyed him.
5On that day Deborah and Barak son
of Abinoam sang this song:
2"When the princes in Israel take the
lead, when the people willingly offer
themselves- praise the LORD !
3"Hear this, you kings! Listen, you rulers!
I will sing to the LORD , I will sing; I will
make music to the LORD , the God of
Israel.
4"O LORD , when you went out from
Seir, when you marched from the land
of Edom, the earth shook, the heavens
poured, the clouds poured down water.
5The mountains quaked before the
LORD , the One of Sinai, before the
LORD , the God of Israel.
6"In the days of Shamgar son of Anath,
in the days of Jael, the roads were
abandoned; travelers took to winding
paths.
7Village life in Israel ceased, ceased
until I, Deborah, arose, arose a mother
in Israel.
8When they chose new gods, war came
to the city gates, and not a shield or
spear was seen among forty thousand
in Israel.
9My heart is with Israel's princes, with
the willing volunteers among the people.
Praise the LORD !
10"You who ride on white donkeys,
sitting on your saddle blankets, and you
who walk along the road, consider
11the voice of the singers at the watering
places. They recite the righteous acts of
the LORD , the righteous acts of his
warriors in Israel. "Then the people of
the LORD went down to the city gates.
12'Wake up, wake up, Deborah! Wake
up, wake up, break out in song! Arise, O
Barak! Take captive your captives, O
son of Abinoam.'
13"Then the men who were left came
down to the nobles; the people of the
LORD came to me with the mighty.
14Some came from Ephraim, whose
roots were in Amalek; Benjamin was
with the people who followed you. From
Makir captains came down, from
Zebulun those who bear a commander's
staff.
15The princes of Issachar were with
Deborah; yes, Issachar was with Barak,
rushing after him into the valley. In the
districts of Reuben there was much
searching of heart.
16Why did you stay among the campfires
to hear the whistling for the flocks? In
the districts of Reuben there was much
searching of heart.
17Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan. And
Dan, why did he linger by the ships?
Asher remained on the coast and stayed
in his coves.
18The people of Zebulun risked their
very lives; so did Naphtali on the heights
of the field.
19"Kings came, they fought; the kings of
Canaan fought at Taanach by the
waters of Megiddo, but they carried off
no silver, no plunder.
20From the heavens the stars fought,
from their courses they fought against
Sisera.
21The river Kishon swept them away, the
age-old river, the river Kishon. March on,
my soul; be strong!
22Then thundered the horses' hoofsgalloping,
galloping go his mighty steeds.
23'Curse Meroz,' said the angel of the
LORD . 'Curse its people bitterly,
because they did not come to help the
LORD , to help the LORD against the
mighty.'
24"Most blessed of women be Jael, the
wife of Heber the Kenite, most blessed
of tent-dwelling women.
25He asked for water, and she gave him
milk; in a bowl fit for nobles she brought
him curdled milk.
26Her hand reached for the tent peg, her
right hand for the workman's hammer.
She struck Sisera, she crushed his head,
she shattered and pierced his temple.
27At her feet he sank, he fell; there he
lay. At her feet he sank, he fell; where
he sank, there he fell-dead.
28"Through the window peered Sisera's
mother; behind the lattice she cried out,
'Why is his chariot so long in coming?
Why is the clatter of his chariots
delayed?'
29The wisest of her ladies answer her;
indeed, she keeps saying to herself,
30'Are they not finding and dividing the
spoils: a girl or two for each man,
colorful garments as plunder for Sisera,
colorful garments embroidered, highly
embroidered garments for my neck- all
this as plunder?'
31"So may all your enemies perish, O
LORD ! But may they who love you be
like the sun when it rises in its strength."
Then the land had peace forty years.
6Again the Israelites did evil in the
eyes of the LORD , and for seven years
he gave them into the hands of the
Midianites.
2Because the power of Midian was so
oppressive, the Israelites prepared
shelters for themselves in mountain
clefts, caves and strongholds.
3Whenever the Israelites planted their
crops, the Midianites, Amalekites and
other eastern peoples invaded the
country.
4They camped on the land and ruined
the crops all the way to Gaza and did
not spare a living thing for Israel, neither
sheep nor cattle nor donkeys.
5They came up with their livestock and
their tents like swarms of locusts. It was
impossible to count the men and their
camels; they invaded the land to ravage
it.
6Midian so impoverished the Israelites
that they cried out to the LORD for help.
7When the Israelites cried to the LORD
because of Midian,
8he sent them a prophet, who said, "This
is what the LORD , the God of Israel,
says: I brought you up out of Egypt, out
of the land of slavery.
9I snatched you from the power of Egypt
and from the hand of all your oppressors.
I drove them from before you and gave
you their land.
10I said to you, 'I am the LORD your
God; do not worship the gods of the
Amorites, in whose land you live.' But
you have not listened to me."
11The angel of the LORD came and sat
down under the oak in Ophrah that
belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where
his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a
winepress to keep it from the Midianites.
12When the angel of the LORD
appeared to Gideon, he said, "The
LORD is with you, mighty warrior."
13"But sir," Gideon replied, "if the LORD
is with us, why has all this happened to
us? Where are all his wonders that our
fathers told us about when they said,
'Did not the LORD bring us up out of
Egypt?' But now the LORD has
abandoned us and put us into the hand
of Midian."
14The LORD turned to him and said, "Go
in the strength you have and save Israel
out of Midian's hand. Am I not sending
you?"
15"But Lord , " Gideon asked, "how can I
save Israel? My clan is the weakest in
Manasseh, and I am the least in my
family."
16The LORD answered, "I will be with
you, and you will strike down all the
Midianites together."
17Gideon replied, "If now I have found
favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it
is really you talking to me.
18Please do not go away until I come
back and bring my offering and set it
before you." And the LORD said, "I will
wait until you return."
19Gideon went in, prepared a young
goat, and from an ephah of flour he
made bread without yeast. Putting the
meat in a basket and its broth in a pot,
he brought them out and offered them to
him under the oak.
20The angel of God said to him, "Take
the meat and the unleavened bread,
place them on this rock, and pour out
the broth." And Gideon did so.
21With the tip of the staff that was in his
hand, the angel of the LORD touched
the meat and the unleavened bread.
Fire flared from the rock, consuming the
meat and the bread. And the angel of
the LORD disappeared.
22When Gideon realized that it was the
angel of the LORD , he exclaimed, "Ah,
Sovereign LORD ! I have seen the angel
of the LORD face to face!"
23But the LORD said to him, "Peace! Do
not be afraid. You are not going to die."
24So Gideon built an altar to the LORD
there and called it The LORD is Peace.
To this day it stands in Ophrah of the
Abiezrites.
25That same night the LORD said to him,
"Take the second bull from your father's
herd, the one seven years old. Tear
down your father's altar to Baal and cut
down the Asherah pole beside it.
26Then build a proper kind of altar to the
LORD your God on the top of this height.
Using the wood of the Asherah pole that
you cut down, offer the second bull as a
burnt offering."
27So Gideon took ten of his servants and
did as the LORD told him. But because
he was afraid of his family and the men
of the town, he did it at night rather than
in the daytime.
28In the morning when the men of the
town got up, there was Baal's altar,
demolished, with the Asherah pole
beside it cut down and the second bull
sacrificed on the newly built altar!
29They asked each other, "Who did
this?" When they carefully investigated,
they were told, "Gideon son of Joash did
it."
30The men of the town demanded of
Joash, "Bring out your son. He must die,
because he has broken down Baal's
altar and cut down the Asherah pole
beside it."
31But Joash replied to the hostile crowd
around him, "Are you going to plead
Baal's cause? Are you trying to save
him? Whoever fights for him shall be put
to death by morning! If Baal really is a
god, he can defend himself when
someone breaks down his altar."
32So that day they called Gideon "Jerub-
Baal, " saying, "Let Baal contend with
him," because he broke down Baal's
altar.
33Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and
other eastern peoples joined forces and
crossed over the Jordan and camped in
the Valley of Jezreel.
34Then the Spirit of the LORD came
upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet,
summoning the Abiezrites to follow him.
35He sent messengers throughout
Manasseh, calling them to arms, and
also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali,
so that they too went up to meet them.
36Gideon said to God, "If you will save
Israel by my hand as you have
promised-
37look, I will place a wool fleece on the
threshing floor. If there is dew only on
the fleece and all the ground is dry, then
I will know that you will save Israel by
my hand, as you said."
38And that is what happened. Gideon
rose early the next day; he squeezed
the fleece and wrung out the dew-a
bowlful of water.
39Then Gideon said to God, "Do not be
angry with me. Let me make just one
more request. Allow me one more test
with the fleece. This time make the
fleece dry and the ground covered with
dew."
40That night God did so. Only the fleece
was dry; all the ground was covered
with dew.
7Early in the morning, Jerub-Baal (that
is, Gideon) and all his men camped at
the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian
was north of them in the valley near the
hill of Moreh.
2The LORD said to Gideon, "You have
too many men for me to deliver Midian
into their hands. In order that Israel may
not boast against me that her own
strength has saved her,
3announce now to the people, 'Anyone
who trembles with fear may turn back
and leave Mount Gilead.' " So twentytwo
thousand men left, while ten
thousand remained.
4But the LORD said to Gideon, "There
are still too many men. Take them down
to the water, and I will sift them for you
there. If I say, 'This one shall go with
you,' he shall go; but if I say, 'This one
shall not go with you,' he shall not go."
5So Gideon took the men down to the
water. There the LORD told him,
"Separate those who lap the water with
their tongues like a dog from those who
kneel down to drink."
6Three hundred men lapped with their
hands to their mouths. All the rest got
down on their knees to drink.
7The LORD said to Gideon, "With the
three hundred men that lapped I will
save you and give the Midianites into
your hands. Let all the other men go,
each to his own place."
8So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites
to their tents but kept the three hundred,
who took over the provisions and
trumpets of the others. Now the camp of
Midian lay below him in the valley.
9During that night the LORD said to
Gideon, "Get up, go down against the
camp, because I am going to give it into
your hands.
10If you are afraid to attack, go down to
the camp with your servant Purah
11and listen to what they are saying.
Afterward, you will be encouraged to
attack the camp." So he and Purah his
servant went down to the outposts of the
camp.
12The Midianites, the Amalekites and all
the other eastern peoples had settled in
the valley, thick as locusts. Their camels
could no more be counted than the sand
on the seashore.
13Gideon arrived just as a man was
telling a friend his dream. "I had a
dream," he was saying. "A round loaf of
barley bread came tumbling into the
Midianite camp. It struck the tent with
such force that the tent overturned and
collapsed."
14His friend responded, "This can be
nothing other than the sword of Gideon
son of Joash, the Israelite. God has
given the Midianites and the whole
camp into his hands."
15When Gideon heard the dream and its
interpretation, he worshiped God. He
returned to the camp of Israel and called
out, "Get up! The LORD has given the
Midianite camp into your hands."
16Dividing the three hundred men into
three companies, he placed trumpets
and empty jars in the hands of all of
them, with torches inside.
17"Watch me," he told them. "Follow my
lead. When I get to the edge of the
camp, do exactly as I do.
18When I and all who are with me blow
our trumpets, then from all around the
camp blow yours and shout, 'For the
LORD and for Gideon.' "
19Gideon and the hundred men with him
reached the edge of the camp at the
beginning of the middle watch, just after
they had changed the guard. They blew
their trumpets and broke the jars that
were in their hands.
20The three companies blew the
trumpets and smashed the jars.
Grasping the torches in their left hands
and holding in their right hands the
trumpets they were to blow, they
shouted, "A sword for the LORD and for
Gideon!"
21While each man held his position
around the camp, all the Midianites ran,
crying out as they fled.
22When the three hundred trumpets
sounded, the LORD caused the men
throughout the camp to turn on each
other with their swords. The army fled to
Beth Shittah toward Zererah as far as
the border of Abel Meholah near
Tabbath.
23Israelites from Naphtali, Asher and all
Manasseh were called out, and they
pursued the Midianites.
24Gideon sent messengers throughout
the hill country of Ephraim, saying,
"Come down against the Midianites and
seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of
them as far as Beth Barah." So all the
men of Ephraim were called out and
they took the waters of the Jordan as far
as Beth Barah.
25They also captured two of the
Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. They
killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and
Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They
pursued the Midianites and brought the
heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who
was by the Jordan.
8Now the Ephraimites asked Gideon,
"Why have you treated us like this? Why
didn't you call us when you went to fight
Midian?" And they criticized him sharply.
2But he answered them, "What have I
accomplished compared to you? Aren't
the gleanings of Ephraim's grapes better
than the full grape harvest of Abiezer?
3God gave Oreb and Zeeb, the Midianite
leaders, into your hands. What was I
able to do compared to you?" At this,
their resentment against him subsided.
4Gideon and his three hundred men,
exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit,
came to the Jordan and crossed it.
5He said to the men of Succoth, "Give
my troops some bread; they are worn
out, and I am still pursuing Zebah and
Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
6But the officials of Succoth said, "Do
you already have the hands of Zebah
and Zalmunna in your possession? Why
should we give bread to your troops?"
7Then Gideon replied, "Just for that,
when the LORD has given Zebah and
Zalmunna into my hand, I will tear your
flesh with desert thorns and briers."
8From there he went up to Peniel and
made the same request of them, but
they answered as the men of Succoth
had.
9So he said to the men of Peniel, "When
I return in triumph, I will tear down this
tower."
10Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in
Karkor with a force of about fifteen
thousand men, all that were left of the
armies of the eastern peoples; a
hundred and twenty thousand
swordsmen had fallen.
11Gideon went up by the route of the
nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah
and fell upon the unsuspecting army.
12Zebah and Zalmunna, the two kings of
Midian, fled, but he pursued them and
captured them, routing their entire army.
13Gideon son of Joash then returned
from the battle by the Pass of Heres.
14He caught a young man of Succoth
and questioned him, and the young man
wrote down for him the names of the
seventy-seven officials of Succoth, the
elders of the town.
15Then Gideon came and said to the
men of Succoth, "Here are Zebah and
Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me
by saying, 'Do you already have the
hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your
possession? Why should we give bread
to your exhausted men?' "
16He took the elders of the town and
taught the men of Succoth a lesson by
punishing them with desert thorns and
briers.
17He also pulled down the tower of
Peniel and killed the men of the town.
18Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna,
"What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?"
"Men like you," they answered, "each
one with the bearing of a prince."
19Gideon replied, "Those were my
brothers, the sons of my own mother. As
surely as the LORD lives, if you had
spared their lives, I would not kill you."
20Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he
said, "Kill them!" But Jether did not draw
his sword, because he was only a boy
and was afraid.
21Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Come, do
it yourself. 'As is the man, so is his
strength.' " So Gideon stepped forward
and killed them, and took the ornaments
off their camels' necks.
22The Israelites said to Gideon, "Rule
over us-you, your son and your
grandson-because you have saved us
out of the hand of Midian."
23But Gideon told them, "I will not rule
over you, nor will my son rule over you.
The LORD will rule over you."
24And he said, "I do have one request,
that each of you give me an earring from
your share of the plunder." (It was the
custom of the Ishmaelites to wear gold
earrings.)
25They answered, "We'll be glad to give
them." So they spread out a garment,
and each man threw a ring from his
plunder onto it.
26The weight of the gold rings he asked
for came to seventeen hundred shekels,
not counting the ornaments, the
pendants and the purple garments worn
by the kings of Midian or the chains that
were on their camels' necks.
27Gideon made the gold into an ephod,
which he placed in Ophrah, his town. All
Israel prostituted themselves by
worshiping it there, and it became a
snare to Gideon and his family.
28Thus Midian was subdued before the
Israelites and did not raise its head
again. During Gideon's lifetime, the land
enjoyed peace forty years.
29Jerub-Baal son of Joash went back
home to live.
30He had seventy sons of his own, for he
had many wives.
31His concubine, who lived in Shechem,
also bore him a son, whom he named
Abimelech.
32Gideon son of Joash died at a good
old age and was buried in the tomb of
his father Joash in Ophrah of the
Abiezrites.
33No sooner had Gideon died than the
Israelites again prostituted themselves
to the Baals. They set up Baal-Berith as
their god and
34did not remember the LORD their God,
who had rescued them from the hands
of all their enemies on every side.
35They also failed to show kindness to
the family of Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon)
for all the good things he had done for
them.
9Abimelech son of Jerub-Baal went to
his mother's brothers in Shechem and
said to them and to all his mother's clan,
2"Ask all the citizens of Shechem,
'Which is better for you: to have all
seventy of Jerub-Baal's sons rule over
you, or just one man?' Remember, I am
your flesh and blood."
3When the brothers repeated all this to
the citizens of Shechem, they were
inclined to follow Abimelech, for they
said, "He is our brother."
4They gave him seventy shekels of
silver from the temple of Baal-Berith,
and Abimelech used it to hire reckless
adventurers, who became his followers.
5He went to his father's home in Ophrah
and on one stone murdered his seventy
brothers, the sons of Jerub-Baal. But
Jotham, the youngest son of Jerub-Baal,
escaped by hiding.
6Then all the citizens of Shechem and
Beth Millo gathered beside the great
tree at the pillar in Shechem to crown
Abimelech king.
7When Jotham was told about this, he
climbed up on the top of Mount Gerizim
and shouted to them, "Listen to me,
citizens of Shechem, so that God may
listen to you.
8One day the trees went out to anoint a
king for themselves. They said to the
olive tree, 'Be our king.'
9"But the olive tree answered, 'Should I
give up my oil, by which both gods and
men are honored, to hold sway over the
trees?'
10"Next, the trees said to the fig tree,
'Come and be our king.'
11"But the fig tree replied, 'Should I give
up my fruit, so good and sweet, to hold
sway over the trees?'
12"Then the trees said to the vine, 'Come
and be our king.'
13"But the vine answered, 'Should I give
up my wine, which cheers both gods
and men, to hold sway over the trees?'
14"Finally all the trees said to the
thornbush, 'Come and be our king.'
15"The thornbush said to the trees, 'If
you really want to anoint me king over
you, come and take refuge in my shade;
but if not, then let fire come out of the
thornbush and consume the cedars of
Lebanon!'
16"Now if you have acted honorably and
in good faith when you made Abimelech
king, and if you have been fair to Jerub-
Baal and his family, and if you have
treated him as he deserves-
17and to think that my father fought for
you, risked his life to rescue you from
the hand of Midian
18(but today you have revolted against
my father's family, murdered his seventy
sons on a single stone, and made
Abimelech, the son of his slave girl, king
over the citizens of Shechem because
he is your brother)-
19if then you have acted honorably and
in good faith toward Jerub-Baal and his
family today, may Abimelech be your joy,
and may you be his, too!
20But if you have not, let fire come out
from Abimelech and consume you,
citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and
let fire come out from you, citizens of
Shechem and Beth Millo, and consume
Abimelech!"
21Then Jotham fled, escaping to Beer,
and he lived there because he was
afraid of his brother Abimelech.
22After Abimelech had governed Israel
three years,
23God sent an evil spirit between
Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem,
who acted treacherously against
Abimelech.
24God did this in order that the crime
against Jerub-Baal's seventy sons, the
shedding of their blood, might be
avenged on their brother Abimelech and
on the citizens of Shechem, who had
helped him murder his brothers.
25In opposition to him these citizens of
Shechem set men on the hilltops to
ambush and rob everyone who passed
by, and this was reported to Abimelech.
26Now Gaal son of Ebed moved with his
brothers into Shechem, and its citizens
put their confidence in him.
27After they had gone out into the fields
and gathered the grapes and trodden
them, they held a festival in the temple
of their god. While they were eating and
drinking, they cursed Abimelech.
28Then Gaal son of Ebed said, "Who is
Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that
we should be subject to him? Isn't he
Jerub-Baal's son, and isn't Zebul his
deputy? Serve the men of Hamor,
Shechem's father! Why should we serve
Abimelech?
29If only this people were under my
command! Then I would get rid of him. I
would say to Abimelech, 'Call out your
whole army!' "
30When Zebul the governor of the city
heard what Gaal son of Ebed said, he
was very angry.
31Under cover he sent messengers to
Abimelech, saying, "Gaal son of Ebed
and his brothers have come to Shechem
and are stirring up the city against you.
32Now then, during the night you and
your men should come and lie in wait in
the fields.
33In the morning at sunrise, advance
against the city. When Gaal and his men
come out against you, do whatever your
hand finds to do."
34So Abimelech and all his troops set
out by night and took up concealed
positions near Shechem in four
companies.
35Now Gaal son of Ebed had gone out
and was standing at the entrance to the
city gate just as Abimelech and his
soldiers came out from their hiding place.
36When Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul,
"Look, people are coming down from the
tops of the mountains!" Zebul replied,
"You mistake the shadows of the
mountains for men."
37But Gaal spoke up again: "Look,
people are coming down from the center
of the land, and a company is coming
from the direction of the soothsayers'
tree."
38Then Zebul said to him, "Where is your
big talk now, you who said, 'Who is
Abimelech that we should be subject to
him?' Aren't these the men you
ridiculed? Go out and fight them!"
39So Gaal led out the citizens of
Shechem and fought Abimelech.
40Abimelech chased him, and many fell
wounded in the flight-all the way to the
entrance to the gate.
41Abimelech stayed in Arumah, and
Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of
Shechem.
42The next day the people of Shechem
went out to the fields, and this was
reported to Abimelech.
43So he took his men, divided them into
three companies and set an ambush in
the fields. When he saw the people
coming out of the city, he rose to attack
them.
44Abimelech and the companies with
him rushed forward to a position at the
entrance to the city gate. Then two
companies rushed upon those in the
fields and struck them down.
45All that day Abimelech pressed his
attack against the city until he had
captured it and killed its people. Then he
destroyed the city and scattered salt
over it.
46On hearing this, the citizens in the
tower of Shechem went into the
stronghold of the temple of El-Berith.
47When Abimelech heard that they had
assembled there,
48he and all his men went up Mount
Zalmon. He took an ax and cut off some
branches, which he lifted to his
shoulders. He ordered the men with him,
"Quick! Do what you have seen me do!"
49So all the men cut branches and
followed Abimelech. They piled them
against the stronghold and set it on fire
over the people inside. So all the people
in the tower of Shechem, about a
thousand men and women, also died.
50Next Abimelech went to Thebez and
besieged it and captured it.
51Inside the city, however, was a strong
tower, to which all the men and womenall
the people of the city-fled. They
locked themselves in and climbed up on
the tower roof.
52Abimelech went to the tower and
stormed it. But as he approached the
entrance to the tower to set it on fire,
53a woman dropped an upper millstone
on his head and cracked his skull.
54Hurriedly he called to his armor-bearer,
"Draw your sword and kill me, so that
they can't say, 'A woman killed him.' "
So his servant ran him through, and he
died.
55When the Israelites saw that
Abimelech was dead, they went home.
56Thus God repaid the wickedness that
Abimelech had done to his father by
murdering his seventy brothers.
57God also made the men of Shechem
pay for all their wickedness. The curse
of Jotham son of Jerub-Baal came on
them.
10After the time of Abimelech a man
of Issachar, Tola son of Puah, the son of
Dodo, rose to save Israel. He lived in
Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim.
2He led Israel twenty-three years; then
he died, and was buried in Shamir.
3He was followed by Jair of Gilead, who
led Israel twenty-two years.
4He had thirty sons, who rode thirty
donkeys. They controlled thirty towns in
Gilead, which to this day are called
Havvoth Jair.
5When Jair died, he was buried in
Kamon.
6Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes
of the LORD . They served the Baals
and the Ashtoreths, and the gods of
Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of
Moab, the gods of the Ammonites and
the gods of the Philistines. And because
the Israelites forsook the LORD and no
longer served him,
7he became angry with them. He sold
them into the hands of the Philistines
and the Ammonites,
8who that year shattered and crushed
them. For eighteen years they
oppressed all the Israelites on the east
side of the Jordan in Gilead, the land of
the Amorites.
9The Ammonites also crossed the
Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin
and the house of Ephraim; and Israel
was in great distress.
10Then the Israelites cried out to the
LORD , "We have sinned against you,
forsaking our God and serving the
Baals."
11The LORD replied, "When the
Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites,
the Philistines,
12the Sidonians, the Amalekites and the
Maonites oppressed you and you cried
to me for help, did I not save you from
their hands?
13But you have forsaken me and served
other gods, so I will no longer save you.
14Go and cry out to the gods you have
chosen. Let them save you when you
are in trouble!"
15But the Israelites said to the LORD ,
"We have sinned. Do with us whatever
you think best, but please rescue us
now."
16Then they got rid of the foreign gods
among them and served the LORD .
And he could bear Israel's misery no
longer.
17When the Ammonites were called to
arms and camped in Gilead, the
Israelites assembled and camped at
Mizpah.
18The leaders of the people of Gilead
said to each other, "Whoever will launch
the attack against the Ammonites will be
the head of all those living in Gilead."
11Jephthah the Gileadite was a
mighty warrior. His father was Gilead;
his mother was a prostitute.
2Gilead's wife also bore him sons, and
when they were grown up, they drove
Jephthah away. "You are not going to
get any inheritance in our family," they
said, "because you are the son of
another woman."
3So Jephthah fled from his brothers and
settled in the land of Tob, where a group
of adventurers gathered around him and
followed him.
4Some time later, when the Ammonites
made war on Israel,
5the elders of Gilead went to get
Jephthah from the land of Tob.
6"Come," they said, "be our commander,
so we can fight the Ammonites."
7Jephthah said to them, "Didn't you hate
me and drive me from my father's
house? Why do you come to me now,
when you're in trouble?"
8The elders of Gilead said to him,
"Nevertheless, we are turning to you
now; come with us to fight the
Ammonites, and you will be our head
over all who live in Gilead."
9Jephthah answered, "Suppose you
take me back to fight the Ammonites
and the LORD gives them to me-will I
really be your head?"
10The elders of Gilead replied, "The
LORD is our witness; we will certainly
do as you say."
11So Jephthah went with the elders of
Gilead, and the people made him head
and commander over them. And he
repeated all his words before the LORD
in Mizpah.
12Then Jephthah sent messengers to
the Ammonite king with the question:
"What do you have against us that you
have attacked our country?"
13The king of the Ammonites answered
Jephthah's messengers, "When Israel
came up out of Egypt, they took away
my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok,
all the way to the Jordan. Now give it
back peaceably."
14Jephthah sent back messengers to the
Ammonite king,
15saying: "This is what Jephthah says:
Israel did not take the land of Moab or
the land of the Ammonites.
16But when they came up out of Egypt,
Israel went through the desert to the
Red Sea and on to Kadesh.
17Then Israel sent messengers to the
king of Edom, saying, 'Give us
permission to go through your country,'
but the king of Edom would not listen.
They sent also to the king of Moab, and
he refused. So Israel stayed at Kadesh.
18"Next they traveled through the desert,
skirted the lands of Edom and Moab,
passed along the eastern side of the
country of Moab, and camped on the
other side of the Arnon. They did not
enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon
was its border.
19"Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon
king of the Amorites, who ruled in
Heshbon, and said to him, 'Let us pass
through your country to our own place.'
20Sihon, however, did not trust Israel to
pass through his territory. He mustered
all his men and encamped at Jahaz and
fought with Israel.
21"Then the LORD , the God of Israel,
gave Sihon and all his men into Israel's
hands, and they defeated them. Israel
took over all the land of the Amorites
who lived in that country,
22capturing all of it from the Arnon to the
Jabbok and from the desert to the
Jordan.
23"Now since the LORD , the God of
Israel, has driven the Amorites out
before his people Israel, what right have
you to take it over?
24Will you not take what your god
Chemosh gives you? Likewise,
whatever the LORD our God has given
us, we will possess.
25Are you better than Balak son of
Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever
quarrel with Israel or fight with them?
26For three hundred years Israel
occupied Heshbon, Aroer, the
surrounding settlements and all the
towns along the Arnon. Why didn't you
retake them during that time?
27I have not wronged you, but you are
doing me wrong by waging war against
me. Let the LORD , the Judge, decide
the dispute this day between the
Israelites and the Ammonites."
28The king of Ammon, however, paid no
attention to the message Jephthah sent
him.
29Then the Spirit of the LORD came
upon Jephthah. He crossed Gilead and
Manasseh, passed through Mizpah of
Gilead, and from there he advanced
against the Ammonites.
30And Jephthah made a vow to the
LORD : "If you give the Ammonites into
my hands,
31whatever comes out of the door of my
house to meet me when I return in
triumph from the Ammonites will be the
LORD 's, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt
offering."
32Then Jephthah went over to fight the
Ammonites, and the LORD gave them
into his hands.
33He devastated twenty towns from
Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as
Abel Keramim. Thus Israel subdued
Ammon.
34When Jephthah returned to his home
in Mizpah, who should come out to meet
him but his daughter, dancing to the
sound of tambourines! She was an only
child. Except for her he had neither son
nor daughter.
35When he saw her, he tore his clothes
and cried, "Oh! My daughter! You have
made me miserable and wretched,
because I have made a vow to the
LORD that I cannot break."
36"My father," she replied, "you have
given your word to the LORD . Do to me
just as you promised, now that the
LORD has avenged you of your
enemies, the Ammonites.
37But grant me this one request," she
said. "Give me two months to roam the
hills and weep with my friends, because
I will never marry."
38"You may go," he said. And he let her
go for two months. She and the girls
went into the hills and wept because she
would never marry.
39After the two months, she returned to
her father and he did to her as he had
vowed. And she was a virgin. From this
comes the Israelite custom
40that each year the young women of
Israel go out for four days to
commemorate the daughter of Jephthah
the Gileadite.
12The men of Ephraim called out
their forces, crossed over to Zaphon and
said to Jephthah, "Why did you go to
fight the Ammonites without calling us to
go with you? We're going to burn down
your house over your head."
2Jephthah answered, "I and my people
were engaged in a great struggle with
the Ammonites, and although I called,
you didn't save me out of their hands.
3When I saw that you wouldn't help, I
took my life in my hands and crossed
over to fight the Ammonites, and the
LORD gave me the victory over them.
Now why have you come up today to
fight me?"
4Jephthah then called together the men
of Gilead and fought against Ephraim.
The Gileadites struck them down
because the Ephraimites had said, "You
Gileadites are renegades from Ephraim
and Manasseh."
5The Gileadites captured the fords of the
Jordan leading to Ephraim, and
whenever a survivor of Ephraim said,
"Let me cross over," the men of Gilead
asked him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" If
he replied, "No,"
6they said, "All right, say 'Shibboleth.' " If
he said, "Sibboleth," because he could
not pronounce the word correctly, they
seized him and killed him at the fords of
the Jordan. Forty-two thousand
Ephraimites were killed at that time.
7Jephthah led Israel six years. Then
Jephthah the Gileadite died, and was
buried in a town in Gilead.
8After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem led Israel.
9He had thirty sons and thirty daughters.
He gave his daughters away in marriage
to those outside his clan, and for his
sons he brought in thirty young women
as wives from outside his clan. Ibzan led
Israel seven years.
10Then Ibzan died, and was buried in
Bethlehem.
11After him, Elon the Zebulunite led
Israel ten years.
12Then Elon died, and was buried in
Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
13After him, Abdon son of Hillel, from
Pirathon, led Israel.
14He had forty sons and thirty grandsons,
who rode on seventy donkeys. He led
Israel eight years.
15Then Abdon son of Hillel died, and
was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim, in
the hill country of the Amalekites.
13Again the Israelites did evil in the
eyes of the LORD , so the LORD
delivered them into the hands of the
Philistines for forty years.
2A certain man of Zorah, named
Manoah, from the clan of the Danites,
had a wife who was sterile and
remained childless.
3The angel of the LORD appeared to her
and said, "You are sterile and childless,
but you are going to conceive and have
a son.
4Now see to it that you drink no wine or
other fermented drink and that you do
not eat anything unclean,
5because you will conceive and give
birth to a son. No razor may be used on
his head, because the boy is to be a
Nazirite, set apart to God from birth, and
he will begin the deliverance of Israel
from the hands of the Philistines."
6Then the woman went to her husband
and told him, "A man of God came to
me. He looked like an angel of God,
very awesome. I didn't ask him where
he came from, and he didn't tell me his
name.
7But he said to me, 'You will conceive
and give birth to a son. Now then, drink
no wine or other fermented drink and do
not eat anything unclean, because the
boy will be a Nazirite of God from birth
until the day of his death.' "
8Then Manoah prayed to the LORD : "O
Lord , I beg you, let the man of God you
sent to us come again to teach us how
to bring up the boy who is to be born."
9God heard Manoah, and the angel of
God came again to the woman while
she was out in the field; but her husband
Manoah was not with her.
10The woman hurried to tell her husband,
"He's here! The man who appeared to
me the other day!"
11Manoah got up and followed his wife.
When he came to the man, he said, "Are
you the one who talked to my wife?" "I
am," he said.
12So Manoah asked him, "When your
words are fulfilled, what is to be the rule
for the boy's life and work?"
13The angel of the LORD answered,
"Your wife must do all that I have told
her.
14She must not eat anything that comes
from the grapevine, nor drink any wine
or other fermented drink nor eat
anything unclean. She must do
everything I have commanded her."
15Manoah said to the angel of the
LORD , "We would like you to stay until
we prepare a young goat for you."
16The angel of the LORD replied, "Even
though you detain me, I will not eat any
of your food. But if you prepare a burnt
offering, offer it to the LORD ." (Manoah
did not realize that it was the angel of
the LORD .)
17Then Manoah inquired of the angel of
the LORD , "What is your name, so that
we may honor you when your word
comes true?"
18He replied, "Why do you ask my
name? It is beyond understanding. "
19Then Manoah took a young goat,
together with the grain offering, and
sacrificed it on a rock to the LORD . And
the LORD did an amazing thing while
Manoah and his wife watched:
20As the flame blazed up from the altar
toward heaven, the angel of the LORD
ascended in the flame. Seeing this,
Manoah and his wife fell with their faces
to the ground.
21When the angel of the LORD did not
show himself again to Manoah and his
wife, Manoah realized that it was the
angel of the LORD .
22"We are doomed to die!" he said to his
wife. "We have seen God!"
23But his wife answered, "If the LORD
had meant to kill us, he would not have
accepted a burnt offering and grain
offering from our hands, nor shown us
all these things or now told us this."
24The woman gave birth to a boy and
named him Samson. He grew and the
LORD blessed him,
25and the Spirit of the LORD began to
stir him while he was in Mahaneh Dan,
between Zorah and Eshtaol.
14Samson went down to Timnah
and saw there a young Philistine woman.
2When he returned, he said to his father
and mother, "I have seen a Philistine
woman in Timnah; now get her for me
as my wife."
3His father and mother replied, "Isn't
there an acceptable woman among your
relatives or among all our people? Must
you go to the uncircumcised Philistines
to get a wife?" But Samson said to his
father, "Get her for me. She's the right
one for me."
4(His parents did not know that this was
from the LORD , who was seeking an
occasion to confront the Philistines; for
at that time they were ruling over Israel.)
5Samson went down to Timnah together
with his father and mother. As they
approached the vineyards of Timnah,
suddenly a young lion came roaring
toward him.
6The Spirit of the LORD came upon him
in power so that he tore the lion apart
with his bare hands as he might have
torn a young goat. But he told neither
his father nor his mother what he had
done.
7Then he went down and talked with the
woman, and he liked her.
8Some time later, when he went back to
marry her, he turned aside to look at the
lion's carcass. In it was a swarm of bees
and some honey,
9which he scooped out with his hands
and ate as he went along. When he
rejoined his parents, he gave them
some, and they too ate it. But he did not
tell them that he had taken the honey
from the lion's carcass.
10Now his father went down to see the
woman. And Samson made a feast
there, as was customary for
bridegrooms.
11When he appeared, he was given
thirty companions.
12"Let me tell you a riddle," Samson said
to them. "If you can give me the answer
within the seven days of the feast, I will
give you thirty linen garments and thirty
sets of clothes.
13If you can't tell me the answer, you
must give me thirty linen garments and
thirty sets of clothes." "Tell us your
riddle," they said. "Let's hear it."
14He replied, "Out of the eater,
something to eat; out of the strong,
something sweet." For three days they
could not give the answer.
15On the fourth day, they said to
Samson's wife, "Coax your husband into
explaining the riddle for us, or we will
burn you and your father's household to
death. Did you invite us here to rob us?"
16Then Samson's wife threw herself on
him, sobbing, "You hate me! You don't
really love me. You've given my people
a riddle, but you haven't told me the
answer." "I haven't even explained it to
my father or mother," he replied, "so
why should I explain it to you?"
17She cried the whole seven days of the
feast. So on the seventh day he finally
told her, because she continued to
press him. She in turn explained the
riddle to her people.
18Before sunset on the seventh day the
men of the town said to him, "What is
sweeter than honey? What is stronger
than a lion?" Samson said to them, "If
you had not plowed with my heifer, you
would not have solved my riddle."
19Then the Spirit of the LORD came
upon him in power. He went down to
Ashkelon, struck down thirty of their
men, stripped them of their belongings
and gave their clothes to those who had
explained the riddle. Burning with anger,
he went up to his father's house.
20And Samson's wife was given to the
friend who had attended him at his
wedding.
15Later on, at the time of wheat
harvest, Samson took a young goat and
went to visit his wife. He said, "I'm going
to my wife's room." But her father would
not let him go in.
2"I was so sure you thoroughly hated
her," he said, "that I gave her to your
friend. Isn't her younger sister more
attractive? Take her instead."
3Samson said to them, "This time I have
a right to get even with the Philistines; I
will really harm them."
4So he went out and caught three
hundred foxes and tied them tail to tail in
pairs. He then fastened a torch to every
pair of tails,
5lit the torches and let the foxes loose in
the standing grain of the Philistines. He
burned up the shocks and standing
grain, together with the vineyards and
olive groves.
6When the Philistines asked, "Who did
this?" they were told, "Samson, the
Timnite's son-in-law, because his wife
was given to his friend." So the
Philistines went up and burned her and
her father to death.
7Samson said to them, "Since you've
acted like this, I won't stop until I get my
revenge on you."
8He attacked them viciously and
slaughtered many of them. Then he
went down and stayed in a cave in the
rock of Etam.
9The Philistines went up and camped in
Judah, spreading out near Lehi.
10The men of Judah asked, "Why have
you come to fight us?" "We have come
to take Samson prisoner," they
answered, "to do to him as he did to us."
11Then three thousand men from Judah
went down to the cave in the rock of
Etam and said to Samson, "Don't you
realize that the Philistines are rulers
over us? What have you done to us?"
He answered, "I merely did to them what
they did to me."
12They said to him, "We've come to tie
you up and hand you over to the
Philistines." Samson said, "Swear to me
that you won't kill me yourselves."
13"Agreed," they answered. "We will only
tie you up and hand you over to them.
We will not kill you." So they bound him
with two new ropes and led him up from
the rock.
14As he approached Lehi, the Philistines
came toward him shouting. The Spirit of
the LORD came upon him in power. The
ropes on his arms became like charred
flax, and the bindings dropped from his
hands.
15Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey,
he grabbed it and struck down a
thousand men.
16Then Samson said, "With a donkey's
jawbone I have made donkeys of them.
With a donkey's jawbone I have killed a
thousand men."
17When he finished speaking, he threw
away the jawbone; and the place was
called Ramath Lehi.
18Because he was very thirsty, he cried
out to the LORD , "You have given your
servant this great victory. Must I now die
of thirst and fall into the hands of the
uncircumcised?"
19Then God opened up the hollow place
in Lehi, and water came out of it. When
Samson drank, his strength returned
and he revived. So the spring was called
En Hakkore, and it is still there in Lehi.
20Samson led Israel for twenty years in
the days of the Philistines.
16One day Samson went to Gaza,
where he saw a prostitute. He went in to
spend the night with her.
2The people of Gaza were told,
"Samson is here!" So they surrounded
the place and lay in wait for him all night
at the city gate. They made no move
during the night, saying, "At dawn we'll
kill him."
3But Samson lay there only until the
middle of the night. Then he got up and
took hold of the doors of the city gate,
together with the two posts, and tore
them loose, bar and all. He lifted them to
his shoulders and carried them to the
top of the hill that faces Hebron.
4Some time later, he fell in love with a
woman in the Valley of Sorek whose
name was Delilah.
5The rulers of the Philistines went to her
and said, "See if you can lure him into
showing you the secret of his great
strength and how we can overpower him
so we may tie him up and subdue him.
Each one of us will give you eleven
hundred shekels of silver."
6So Delilah said to Samson, "Tell me the
secret of your great strength and how
you can be tied up and subdued."
7Samson answered her, "If anyone ties
me with seven fresh thongs that have
not been dried, I'll become as weak as
any other man."
8Then the rulers of the Philistines
brought her seven fresh thongs that had
not been dried, and she tied him with
them.
9With men hidden in the room, she
called to him, "Samson, the Philistines
are upon you!" But he snapped the
thongs as easily as a piece of string
snaps when it comes close to a flame.
So the secret of his strength was not
discovered.
10Then Delilah said to Samson, "You
have made a fool of me; you lied to me.
Come now, tell me how you can be
tied."
11He said, "If anyone ties me securely
with new ropes that have never been
used, I'll become as weak as any other
man."
12So Delilah took new ropes and tied
him with them. Then, with men hidden in
the room, she called to him, "Samson,
the Philistines are upon you!" But he
snapped the ropes off his arms as if
they were threads.
13Delilah then said to Samson, "Until
now, you have been making a fool of me
and lying to me. Tell me how you can be
tied." He replied, "If you weave the
seven braids of my head into the fabric
on the loom and tighten it with the pin,
I'll become as weak as any other man."
So while he was sleeping, Delilah took
the seven braids of his head, wove them
into the fabric
14and tightened it with the pin. Again she
called to him, "Samson, the Philistines
are upon you!" He awoke from his sleep
and pulled up the pin and the loom, with
the fabric.
15Then she said to him, "How can you
say, 'I love you,' when you won't confide
in me? This is the third time you have
made a fool of me and haven't told me
the secret of your great strength."
16With such nagging she prodded him
day after day until he was tired to death.
17So he told her everything. "No razor
has ever been used on my head," he
said, "because I have been a Nazirite
set apart to God since birth. If my head
were shaved, my strength would leave
me, and I would become as weak as
any other man."
18When Delilah saw that he had told her
everything, she sent word to the rulers
of the Philistines, "Come back once
more; he has told me everything." So
the rulers of the Philistines returned with
the silver in their hands.
19Having put him to sleep on her lap,
she called a man to shave off the seven
braids of his hair, and so began to
subdue him. And his strength left him.
20Then she called, "Samson, the
Philistines are upon you!" He awoke
from his sleep and thought, "I'll go out
as before and shake myself free." But
he did not know that the LORD had left
him.
21Then the Philistines seized him,
gouged out his eyes and took him down
to Gaza. Binding him with bronze
shackles, they set him to grinding in the
prison.
22But the hair on his head began to grow
again after it had been shaved.
23Now the rulers of the Philistines
assembled to offer a great sacrifice to
Dagon their god and to celebrate,
saying, "Our god has delivered Samson,
our enemy, into our hands."
24When the people saw him, they
praised their god, saying, "Our god has
delivered our enemy into our hands, the
one who laid waste our land and
multiplied our slain."
25While they were in high spirits, they
shouted, "Bring out Samson to entertain
us." So they called Samson out of the
prison, and he performed for them.
When they stood him among the pillars,
26Samson said to the servant who held
his hand, "Put me where I can feel the
pillars that support the temple, so that I
may lean against them."
27Now the temple was crowded with
men and women; all the rulers of the
Philistines were there, and on the roof
were about three thousand men and
women watching Samson perform.
28Then Samson prayed to the LORD ,
"O Sovereign LORD , remember me. O
God, please strengthen me just once
more, and let me with one blow get
revenge on the Philistines for my two
eyes."
29Then Samson reached toward the two
central pillars on which the temple stood.
Bracing himself against them, his right
hand on the one and his left hand on the
other,
30Samson said, "Let me die with the
Philistines!" Then he pushed with all his
might, and down came the temple on
the rulers and all the people in it. Thus
he killed many more when he died than
while he lived.
31Then his brothers and his father's
whole family went down to get him.
They brought him back and buried him
between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb
of Manoah his father. He had led Israel
twenty years.
17Now a man named Micah from the
hill country of Ephraim
2said to his mother, "The eleven
hundred shekels of silver that were
taken from you and about which I heard
you utter a curse-I have that silver with
me; I took it." Then his mother said,
"The LORD bless you, my son!"
3When he returned the eleven hundred
shekels of silver to his mother, she said,
"I solemnly consecrate my silver to the
LORD for my son to make a carved
image and a cast idol. I will give it back
to you."
4So he returned the silver to his mother,
and she took two hundred shekels of
silver and gave them to a silversmith,
who made them into the image and the
idol. And they were put in Micah's house.
5Now this man Micah had a shrine, and
he made an ephod and some idols and
installed one of his sons as his priest.
6In those days Israel had no king;
everyone did as he saw fit.
7A young Levite from Bethlehem in
Judah, who had been living within the
clan of Judah,
8left that town in search of some other
place to stay. On his way he came to
Micah's house in the hill country of
Ephraim.
9Micah asked him, "Where are you
from?" "I'm a Levite from Bethlehem in
Judah," he said, "and I'm looking for a
place to stay."
10Then Micah said to him, "Live with me
and be my father and priest, and I'll give
you ten shekels of silver a year, your
clothes and your food."
11So the Levite agreed to live with him,
and the young man was to him like one
of his sons.
12Then Micah installed the Levite, and
the young man became his priest and
lived in his house.
13And Micah said, "Now I know that the
LORD will be good to me, since this
Levite has become my priest."
18In those days Israel had no king.
And in those days the tribe of the
Danites was seeking a place of their
own where they might settle, because
they had not yet come into an
inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
2So the Danites sent five warriors from
Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land
and explore it. These men represented
all their clans. They told them, "Go,
explore the land." The men entered the
hill country of Ephraim and came to the
house of Micah, where they spent the
night.
3When they were near Micah's house,
they recognized the voice of the young
Levite; so they turned in there and
asked him, "Who brought you here?
What are you doing in this place? Why
are you here?"
4He told them what Micah had done for
him, and said, "He has hired me and I
am his priest."
5Then they said to him, "Please inquire
of God to learn whether our journey will
be successful."
6The priest answered them, "Go in
peace. Your journey has the LORD 's
approval."
7So the five men left and came to Laish,
where they saw that the people were
living in safety, like the Sidonians,
unsuspecting and secure. And since
their land lacked nothing, they were
prosperous. Also, they lived a long way
from the Sidonians and had no
relationship with anyone else.
8When they returned to Zorah and
Eshtaol, their brothers asked them,
"How did you find things?"
9They answered, "Come on, let's attack
them! We have seen that the land is
very good. Aren't you going to do
something? Don't hesitate to go there
and take it over.
10When you get there, you will find an
unsuspecting people and a spacious
land that God has put into your hands, a
land that lacks nothing whatever."
11Then six hundred men from the clan of
the Danites, armed for battle, set out
from Zorah and Eshtaol.
12On their way they set up camp near
Kiriath Jearim in Judah. This is why the
place west of Kiriath Jearim is called
Mahaneh Dan to this day.
13From there they went on to the hill
country of Ephraim and came to Micah's
house.
14Then the five men who had spied out
the land of Laish said to their brothers,
"Do you know that one of these houses
has an ephod, other household gods, a
carved image and a cast idol? Now you
know what to do."
15So they turned in there and went to the
house of the young Levite at Micah's
place and greeted him.
16The six hundred Danites, armed for
battle, stood at the entrance to the gate.
17The five men who had spied out the
land went inside and took the carved
image, the ephod, the other household
gods and the cast idol while the priest
and the six hundred armed men stood at
the entrance to the gate.
18When these men went into Micah's
house and took the carved image, the
ephod, the other household gods and
the cast idol, the priest said to them,
"What are you doing?"
19They answered him, "Be quiet! Don't
say a word. Come with us, and be our
father and priest. Isn't it better that you
serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest
rather than just one man's household?"
20Then the priest was glad. He took the
ephod, the other household gods and
the carved image and went along with
the people.
21Putting their little children, their
livestock and their possessions in front
of them, they turned away and left.
22When they had gone some distance
from Micah's house, the men who lived
near Micah were called together and
overtook the Danites.
23As they shouted after them, the
Danites turned and said to Micah,
"What's the matter with you that you
called out your men to fight?"
24He replied, "You took the gods I made,
and my priest, and went away. What
else do I have? How can you ask,
'What's the matter with you?' "
25The Danites answered, "Don't argue
with us, or some hot-tempered men will
attack you, and you and your family will
lose your lives."
26So the Danites went their way, and
Micah, seeing that they were too strong
for him, turned around and went back
home.
27Then they took what Micah had made,
and his priest, and went on to Laish,
against a peaceful and unsuspecting
people. They attacked them with the
sword and burned down their city.
28There was no one to rescue them
because they lived a long way from
Sidon and had no relationship with
anyone else. The city was in a valley
near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt
the city and settled there.
29They named it Dan after their
forefather Dan, who was born to Israelthough
the city used to be called Laish.
30There the Danites set up for
themselves the idols, and Jonathan son
of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his
sons were priests for the tribe of Dan
until the time of the captivity of the land.
31They continued to use the idols Micah
had made, all the time the house of God
was in Shiloh.
19In those days Israel had no king.
Now a Levite who lived in a remote area
in the hill country of Ephraim took a
concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.
2But she was unfaithful to him. She left
him and went back to her father's house
in Bethlehem, Judah. After she had
been there four months,
3her husband went to her to persuade
her to return. He had with him his
servant and two donkeys. She took him
into her father's house, and when her
father saw him, he gladly welcomed him.
4His father-in-law, the girl's father,
prevailed upon him to stay; so he
remained with him three days, eating
and drinking, and sleeping there.
5On the fourth day they got up early and
he prepared to leave, but the girl's father
said to his son-in-law, "Refresh yourself
with something to eat; then you can go."
6So the two of them sat down to eat and
drink together. Afterward the girl's father
said, "Please stay tonight and enjoy
yourself."
7And when the man got up to go, his
father-in-law persuaded him, so he
stayed there that night.
8On the morning of the fifth day, when
he rose to go, the girl's father said,
"Refresh yourself. Wait till afternoon!"
So the two of them ate together.
9Then when the man, with his concubine
and his servant, got up to leave, his
father-in-law, the girl's father, said, "Now
look, it's almost evening. Spend the
night here; the day is nearly over. Stay
and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow
morning you can get up and be on your
way home."
10But, unwilling to stay another night, the
man left and went toward Jebus (that is,
Jerusalem), with his two saddled
donkeys and his concubine.
11When they were near Jebus and the
day was almost gone, the servant said
to his master, "Come, let's stop at this
city of the Jebusites and spend the
night."
12His master replied, "No. We won't go
into an alien city, whose people are not
Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah."
13He added, "Come, let's try to reach
Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night
in one of those places."
14So they went on, and the sun set as
they neared Gibeah in Benjamin.
15There they stopped to spend the night.
They went and sat in the city square, but
no one took them into his home for the
night.
16That evening an old man from the hill
country of Ephraim, who was living in
Gibeah (the men of the place were
Benjamites), came in from his work in
the fields.
17When he looked and saw the traveler
in the city square, the old man asked,
"Where are you going? Where did you
come from?"
18He answered, "We are on our way
from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote
area in the hill country of Ephraim where
I live. I have been to Bethlehem in
Judah and now I am going to the house
of the LORD . No one has taken me into
his house.
19We have both straw and fodder for our
donkeys and bread and wine for
ourselves your servants-me, your
maidservant, and the young man with us.
We don't need anything."
20"You are welcome at my house," the
old man said. "Let me supply whatever
you need. Only don't spend the night in
the square."
21So he took him into his house and fed
his donkeys. After they had washed
their feet, they had something to eat and
drink.
22While they were enjoying themselves,
some of the wicked men of the city
surrounded the house. Pounding on the
door, they shouted to the old man who
owned the house, "Bring out the man
who came to your house so we can
have sex with him."
23The owner of the house went outside
and said to them, "No, my friends, don't
be so vile. Since this man is my guest,
don't do this disgraceful thing.
24Look, here is my virgin daughter, and
his concubine. I will bring them out to
you now, and you can use them and do
to them whatever you wish. But to this
man, don't do such a disgraceful thing."
25But the men would not listen to him.
So the man took his concubine and sent
her outside to them, and they raped her
and abused her throughout the night,
and at dawn they let her go.
26At daybreak the woman went back to
the house where her master was staying,
fell down at the door and lay there until
daylight.
27When her master got up in the
morning and opened the door of the
house and stepped out to continue on
his way, there lay his concubine, fallen
in the doorway of the house, with her
hands on the threshold.
28He said to her, "Get up; let's go." But
there was no answer. Then the man put
her on his donkey and set out for home.
29When he reached home, he took a
knife and cut up his concubine, limb by
limb, into twelve parts and sent them
into all the areas of Israel.
30Everyone who saw it said, "Such a
thing has never been seen or done, not
since the day the Israelites came up out
of Egypt. Think about it! Consider it! Tell
us what to do!"
20Then all the Israelites from Dan to
Beersheba and from the land of Gilead
came out as one man and assembled
before the LORD in Mizpah.
2The leaders of all the people of the
tribes of Israel took their places in the
assembly of the people of God, four
hundred thousand soldiers armed with
swords.
3(The Benjamites heard that the
Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.) Then
the Israelites said, "Tell us how this
awful thing happened."
4So the Levite, the husband of the
murdered woman, said, "I and my
concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin
to spend the night.
5During the night the men of Gibeah
came after me and surrounded the
house, intending to kill me. They raped
my concubine, and she died.
6I took my concubine, cut her into pieces
and sent one piece to each region of
Israel's inheritance, because they
committed this lewd and disgraceful act
in Israel.
7Now, all you Israelites, speak up and
give your verdict."
8All the people rose as one man, saying,
"None of us will go home. No, not one of
us will return to his house.
9But now this is what we'll do to Gibeah:
We'll go up against it as the lot directs.
10We'll take ten men out of every
hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and
a hundred from a thousand, and a
thousand from ten thousand, to get
provisions for the army. Then, when the
army arrives at Gibeah in Benjamin, it
can give them what they deserve for all
this vileness done in Israel."
11So all the men of Israel got together
and united as one man against the city.
12The tribes of Israel sent men
throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying,
"What about this awful crime that was
committed among you?
13Now surrender those wicked men of
Gibeah so that we may put them to
death and purge the evil from Israel."
But the Benjamites would not listen to
their fellow Israelites.
14From their towns they came together
at Gibeah to fight against the Israelites.
15At once the Benjamites mobilized
twenty-six thousand swordsmen from
their towns, in addition to seven hundred
chosen men from those living in Gibeah.
16Among all these soldiers there were
seven hundred chosen men who were
left-handed, each of whom could sling a
stone at a hair and not miss.
17Israel, apart from Benjamin, mustered
four hundred thousand swordsmen, all
of them fighting men.
18The Israelites went up to Bethel and
inquired of God. They said, "Who of us
shall go first to fight against the
Benjamites?" The LORD replied, "Judah
shall go first."
19The next morning the Israelites got up
and pitched camp near Gibeah.
20The men of Israel went out to fight the
Benjamites and took up battle positions
against them at Gibeah.
21The Benjamites came out of Gibeah
and cut down twenty-two thousand
Israelites on the battlefield that day.
22But the men of Israel encouraged one
another and again took up their
positions where they had stationed
themselves the first day.
23The Israelites went up and wept before
the LORD until evening, and they
inquired of the LORD . They said, "Shall
we go up again to battle against the
Benjamites, our brothers?" The LORD
answered, "Go up against them."
24Then the Israelites drew near to
Benjamin the second day.
25This time, when the Benjamites came
out from Gibeah to oppose them, they
cut down another eighteen thousand
Israelites, all of them armed with swords.
26Then the Israelites, all the people,
went up to Bethel, and there they sat
weeping before the LORD . They fasted
that day until evening and presented
burnt offerings and fellowship offerings
to the LORD .
27And the Israelites inquired of the
LORD . (In those days the ark of the
covenant of God was there,
28with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son
of Aaron, ministering before it.) They
asked, "Shall we go up again to battle
with Benjamin our brother, or not?" The
LORD responded, "Go, for tomorrow I
will give them into your hands."
29Then Israel set an ambush around
Gibeah.
30They went up against the Benjamites
on the third day and took up positions
against Gibeah as they had done before.
31The Benjamites came out to meet
them and were drawn away from the city.
They began to inflict casualties on the
Israelites as before, so that about thirty
men fell in the open field and on the
roads-the one leading to Bethel and the
other to Gibeah.
32While the Benjamites were saying,
"We are defeating them as before," the
Israelites were saying, "Let's retreat and
draw them away from the city to the
roads."
33All the men of Israel moved from their
places and took up positions at Baal
Tamar, and the Israelite ambush
charged out of its place on the west of
Gibeah.
34Then ten thousand of Israel's finest
men made a frontal attack on Gibeah.
The fighting was so heavy that the
Benjamites did not realize how near
disaster was.
35The LORD defeated Benjamin before
Israel, and on that day the Israelites
struck down 25,100 Benjamites, all
armed with swords.
36Then the Benjamites saw that they
were beaten. Now the men of Israel had
given way before Benjamin, because
they relied on the ambush they had set
near Gibeah.
37The men who had been in ambush
made a sudden dash into Gibeah,
spread out and put the whole city to the
sword.
38The men of Israel had arranged with
the ambush that they should send up a
great cloud of smoke from the city,
39and then the men of Israel would turn
in the battle. The Benjamites had begun
to inflict casualties on the men of Israel
(about thirty), and they said, "We are
defeating them as in the first battle."
40But when the column of smoke began
to rise from the city, the Benjamites
turned and saw the smoke of the whole
city going up into the sky.
41Then the men of Israel turned on them,
and the men of Benjamin were terrified,
because they realized that disaster had
come upon them.
42So they fled before the Israelites in the
direction of the desert, but they could
not escape the battle. And the men of
Israel who came out of the towns cut
them down there.
43They surrounded the Benjamites,
chased them and easily overran them in
the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.
44Eighteen thousand Benjamites fell, all
of them valiant fighters.
45As they turned and fled toward the
desert to the rock of Rimmon, the
Israelites cut down five thousand men
along the roads. They kept pressing
after the Benjamites as far as Gidom
and struck down two thousand more.
46On that day twenty-five thousand
Benjamite swordsmen fell, all of them
valiant fighters.
47But six hundred men turned and fled
into the desert to the rock of Rimmon,
where they stayed four months.
48The men of Israel went back to
Benjamin and put all the towns to the
sword, including the animals and
everything else they found. All the towns
they came across they set on fire.
21The men of Israel had taken an
oath at Mizpah: "Not one of us will give
his daughter in marriage to a
Benjamite."
2The people went to Bethel, where they
sat before God until evening, raising
their voices and weeping bitterly.
3"O LORD , the God of Israel," they
cried, "why has this happened to Israel?
Why should one tribe be missing from
Israel today?"
4Early the next day the people built an
altar and presented burnt offerings and
fellowship offerings.
5Then the Israelites asked, "Who from
all the tribes of Israel has failed to
assemble before the LORD ?" For they
had taken a solemn oath that anyone
who failed to assemble before the
LORD at Mizpah should certainly be put
to death.
6Now the Israelites grieved for their
brothers, the Benjamites. "Today one
tribe is cut off from Israel," they said.
7"How can we provide wives for those
who are left, since we have taken an
oath by the LORD not to give them any
of our daughters in marriage?"
8Then they asked, "Which one of the
tribes of Israel failed to assemble before
the LORD at Mizpah?" They discovered
that no one from Jabesh Gilead had
come to the camp for the assembly.
9For when they counted the people, they
found that none of the people of Jabesh
Gilead were there.
10So the assembly sent twelve thousand
fighting men with instructions to go to
Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword
those living there, including the women
and children.
11"This is what you are to do," they said.
"Kill every male and every woman who
is not a virgin."
12They found among the people living in
Jabesh Gilead four hundred young
women who had never slept with a man,
and they took them to the camp at
Shiloh in Canaan.
13Then the whole assembly sent an offer
of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of
Rimmon.
14So the Benjamites returned at that
time and were given the women of
Jabesh Gilead who had been spared.
But there were not enough for all of
them.
15The people grieved for Benjamin,
because the LORD had made a gap in
the tribes of Israel.
16And the elders of the assembly said,
"With the women of Benjamin destroyed,
how shall we provide wives for the men
who are left?
17The Benjamite survivors must have
heirs," they said, "so that a tribe of Israel
will not be wiped out.
18We can't give them our daughters as
wives, since we Israelites have taken
this oath: 'Cursed be anyone who gives
a wife to a Benjamite.'
19But look, there is the annual festival of
the LORD in Shiloh, to the north of
Bethel, and east of the road that goes
from Bethel to Shechem, and to the
south of Lebonah."
20So they instructed the Benjamites,
saying, "Go and hide in the vineyards
21and watch. When the girls of Shiloh
come out to join in the dancing, then
rush from the vineyards and each of you
seize a wife from the girls of Shiloh and
go to the land of Benjamin.
22When their fathers or brothers
complain to us, we will say to them, 'Do
us a kindness by helping them, because
we did not get wives for them during the
war, and you are innocent, since you did
not give your daughters to them.' "
23So that is what the Benjamites did.
While the girls were dancing, each man
caught one and carried her off to be his
wife. Then they returned to their
inheritance and rebuilt the towns and
settled in them.
24At that time the Israelites left that place
and went home to their tribes and clans,
each to his own inheritance.
25In those days Israel had no king;
everyone did as he saw fit.
Ruth
1In the days when the judges ruled,
there was a famine in the land, and a
man from Bethlehem in Judah, together
with his wife and two sons, went to live
for a while in the country of Moab.
2The man's name was Elimelech, his
wife's name Naomi, and the names of
his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion.
They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem,
Judah. And they went to Moab and lived
there.
3Now Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died,
and she was left with her two sons.
4They married Moabite women, one
named Orpah and the other Ruth. After
they had lived there about ten years,
5both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and
Naomi was left without her two sons and
her husband.
6When she heard in Moab that the Lord
had come to the aid of his people by
providing food for them, Naomi and her
daughters-in-law prepared to return
home from there.
7With her two daughters-in-law she left
the place where she had been living and
set out on the road that would take them
back to the land of Judah.
8Then Naomi said to her two daughtersin-
law, "Go back, each of you, to your
mother's home. May the Lord show
kindness to you, as you have shown to
your dead and to me.
9May the Lord grant that each of you will
find rest in the home of another
husband." Then she kissed them and
they wept aloud
10and said to her, "We will go back with
you to your people."
11But Naomi said, "Return home, my
daughters. Why would you come with
me? Am I going to have any more sons,
who could become your husbands?
12Return home, my daughters; I am too
old to have another husband. Even if I
thought there was still hope for me-even
if I had a husband tonight and then gave
birth to sons-
13would you wait until they grew up?
Would you remain unmarried for them?
No, my daughters. It is more bitter for
me than for you, because the Lord 's
hand has gone out against me!"
14At this they wept again. Then Orpah
kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but
Ruth clung to her.
15"Look," said Naomi, "your sister-in-law
is going back to her people and her
gods. Go back with her."
16But Ruth replied, "Don't urge me to
leave you or to turn back from you.
Where you go I will go, and where you
stay I will stay. Your people will be my
people and your God my God.
17Where you die I will die, and there I
will be buried. May the Lord deal with
me, be it ever so severely, if anything
but death separates you and me."
18When Naomi realized that Ruth was
determined to go with her, she stopped
urging her.
19So the two women went on until they
came to Bethlehem. When they arrived
in Bethlehem, the whole town was
stirred because of them, and the women
exclaimed, "Can this be Naomi?"
20"Don't call me Naomi, " she told them.
"Call me Mara, because the Almighty
has made my life very bitter.
21I went away full, but the Lord has
brought me back empty. Why call me
Naomi? The Lord has afflicted me; the
Almighty has brought misfortune upon
me."
22So Naomi returned from Moab
accompanied by Ruth the Moabitess,
her daughter-in-law, arriving in
Bethlehem as the barley harvest was
beginning.
2Now Naomi had a relative on her
husband's side, from the clan of
Elimelech, a man of standing, whose
name was Boaz.
2And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi,
"Let me go to the fields and pick up the
leftover grain behind anyone in whose
eyes I find favor." Naomi said to her,
"Go ahead, my daughter."
3So she went out and began to glean in
the fields behind the harvesters. As it
turned out, she found herself working in
a field belonging to Boaz, who was from
the clan of Elimelech.
4Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem
and greeted the harvesters, "The Lord
be with you!" "The Lord bless you!" they
called back.
5Boaz asked the foreman of his
harvesters, "Whose young woman is
that?"
6The foreman replied, "She is the
Moabitess who came back from Moab
with Naomi.
7She said, 'Please let me glean and
gather among the sheaves behind the
harvesters.' She went into the field and
has worked steadily from morning till
now, except for a short rest in the
shelter."
8So Boaz said to Ruth, "My daughter,
listen to me. Don't go and glean in
another field and don't go away from
here. Stay here with my servant girls.
9Watch the field where the men are
harvesting, and follow along after the
girls. I have told the men not to touch
you. And whenever you are thirsty, go
and get a drink from the water jars the
men have filled."
10At this, she bowed down with her face
to the ground. She exclaimed, "Why
have I found such favor in your eyes
that you notice me-a foreigner?"
11Boaz replied, "I've been told all about
what you have done for your mother-inlaw
since the death of your husbandhow
you left your father and mother and
your homeland and came to live with a
people you did not know before.
12May the Lord repay you for what you
have done. May you be richly rewarded
by the Lord , the God of Israel, under
whose wings you have come to take
refuge."
13"May I continue to find favor in your
eyes, my lord," she said. "You have
given me comfort and have spoken
kindly to your servant-though I do not
have the standing of one of your servant
girls."
14At mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come
over here. Have some bread and dip it
in the wine vinegar." When she sat
down with the harvesters, he offered her
some roasted grain. She ate all she
wanted and had some left over.
15As she got up to glean, Boaz gave
orders to his men, "Even if she gathers
among the sheaves, don't embarrass
her.
16Rather, pull out some stalks for her
from the bundles and leave them for her
to pick up, and don't rebuke her."
17So Ruth gleaned in the field until
evening. Then she threshed the barley
she had gathered, and it amounted to
about an ephah.
18She carried it back to town, and her
mother-in-law saw how much she had
gathered. Ruth also brought out and
gave her what she had left over after
she had eaten enough.
19Her mother-in-law asked her, "Where
did you glean today? Where did you
work? Blessed be the man who took
notice of you!" Then Ruth told her
mother-in-law about the one at whose
place she had been working. "The name
of the man I worked with today is Boaz,"
she said.
20"The Lord bless him!" Naomi said to
her daughter-in-law. "He has not
stopped showing his kindness to the
living and the dead." She added, "That
man is our close relative; he is one of
our kinsman-redeemers."
21Then Ruth the Moabitess said, "He
even said to me, 'Stay with my workers
until they finish harvesting all my grain.' "
22Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-inlaw,
"It will be good for you, my daughter,
to go with his girls, because in someone
else's field you might be harmed."
23So Ruth stayed close to the servant
girls of Boaz to glean until the barley
and wheat harvests were finished. And
she lived with her mother-in-law.
3One day Naomi her mother-in-law
said to her, "My daughter, should I not
try to find a home for you, where you will
be well provided for?
2Is not Boaz, with whose servant girls
you have been, a kinsman of ours?
Tonight he will be winnowing barley on
the threshing floor.
3Wash and perfume yourself, and put on
your best clothes. Then go down to the
threshing floor, but don't let him know
you are there until he has finished
eating and drinking.
4When he lies down, note the place
where he is lying. Then go and uncover
his feet and lie down. He will tell you
what to do."
5"I will do whatever you say," Ruth
answered.
6So she went down to the threshing floor
and did everything her mother-in-law
told her to do.
7When Boaz had finished eating and
drinking and was in good spirits, he
went over to lie down at the far end of
the grain pile. Ruth approached quietly,
uncovered his feet and lay down.
8In the middle of the night something
startled the man, and he turned and
discovered a woman lying at his feet.
9"Who are you?" he asked. "I am your
servant Ruth," she said. "Spread the
corner of your garment over me, since
you are a kinsman-redeemer."
10"The Lord bless you, my daughter," he
replied. "This kindness is greater than
that which you showed earlier: You have
not run after the younger men, whether
rich or poor.
11And now, my daughter, don't be afraid.
I will do for you all you ask. All my fellow
townsmen know that you are a woman
of noble character.
12Although it is true that I am near of kin,
there is a kinsman-redeemer nearer
than I.
13Stay here for the night, and in the
morning if he wants to redeem, good; let
him redeem. But if he is not willing, as
surely as the Lord lives I will do it. Lie
here until morning."
14So she lay at his feet until morning, but
got up before anyone could be
recognized; and he said, "Don't let it be
known that a woman came to the
threshing floor."
15He also said, "Bring me the shawl you
are wearing and hold it out." When she
did so, he poured into it six measures of
barley and put it on her. Then he went
back to town.
16When Ruth came to her mother-in-law,
Naomi asked, "How did it go, my
daughter?" Then she told her everything
Boaz had done for her
17and added, "He gave me these six
measures of barley, saying, 'Don't go
back to your mother-in-law emptyhanded.'
"
18Then Naomi said, "Wait, my daughter,
until you find out what happens. For the
man will not rest until the matter is
settled today."
4Meanwhile Boaz went up to the town
gate and sat there. When the kinsmanredeemer
he had mentioned came
along, Boaz said, "Come over here, my
friend, and sit down." So he went over
and sat down.
2Boaz took ten of the elders of the town
and said, "Sit here," and they did so.
3Then he said to the kinsman-redeemer,
"Naomi, who has come back from Moab,
is selling the piece of land that belonged
to our brother Elimelech.
4I thought I should bring the matter to
your attention and suggest that you buy
it in the presence of these seated here
and in the presence of the elders of my
people. If you will redeem it, do so. But if
you will not, tell me, so I will know. For
no one has the right to do it except you,
and I am next in line." "I will redeem it,"
he said.
5Then Boaz said, "On the day you buy
the land from Naomi and from Ruth the
Moabitess, you acquire the dead man's
widow, in order to maintain the name of
the dead with his property."
6At this, the kinsman-redeemer said,
"Then I cannot redeem it because I
might endanger my own estate. You
redeem it yourself. I cannot do it."
7(Now in earlier times in Israel, for the
redemption and transfer of property to
become final, one party took off his
sandal and gave it to the other. This was
the method of legalizing transactions in
Israel.)
8So the kinsman-redeemer said to Boaz,
"Buy it yourself." And he removed his
sandal.
9Then Boaz announced to the elders
and all the people, "Today you are
witnesses that I have bought from
Naomi all the property of Elimelech,
Kilion and Mahlon.
10I have also acquired Ruth the
Moabitess, Mahlon's widow, as my wife,
in order to maintain the name of the
dead with his property, so that his name
will not disappear from among his family
or from the town records. Today you are
witnesses!"
11Then the elders and all those at the
gate said, "We are witnesses. May the
Lord make the woman who is coming
into your home like Rachel and Leah,
who together built up the house of Israel.
May you have standing in Ephrathah
and be famous in Bethlehem.
12Through the offspring the Lord gives
you by this young woman, may your
family be like that of Perez, whom
Tamar bore to Judah."
13So Boaz took Ruth and she became
his wife. Then he went to her, and the
Lord enabled her to conceive, and she
gave birth to a son.
14The women said to Naomi: "Praise be
to the Lord , who this day has not left
you without a kinsman-redeemer. May
he become famous throughout Israel!
15He will renew your life and sustain you
in your old age. For your daughter-inlaw,
who loves you and who is better to
you than seven sons, has given him
birth."
16Then Naomi took the child, laid him in
her lap and cared for him.
17The women living there said, "Naomi
has a son." And they named him Obed.
He was the father of Jesse, the father of
David.
18This, then, is the family line of Perez:
Perez was the father of Hezron,
19Hezron the father of Ram, Ram the
father of Amminadab,
20Amminadab the father of Nahshon,
Nahshon the father of Salmon,
21Salmon the father of Boaz, Boaz the
father of Obed,
22Obed the father of Jesse, and Jesse
the father of David.
1st Samuel
1There was a certain man from
Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill
country of Ephraim, whose name was
Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of
Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph,
an Ephraimite.
2He had two wives; one was called
Hannah and the other Peninnah.
Peninnah had children, but Hannah had
none.
3Year after year this man went up from
his town to worship and sacrifice to the
Lord Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni
and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were
priests of the Lord .
4Whenever the day came for Elkanah to
sacrifice, he would give portions of the
meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her
sons and daughters.
5But to Hannah he gave a double
portion because he loved her, and the
Lord had closed her womb.
6And because the Lord had closed her
womb, her rival kept provoking her in
order to irritate her.
7This went on year after year. Whenever
Hannah went up to the house of the
Lord , her rival provoked her till she
wept and would not eat.
8Elkanah her husband would say to her,
"Hannah, why are you weeping? Why
don't you eat? Why are you
downhearted? Don't I mean more to you
than ten sons?"
9Once when they had finished eating
and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up.
Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair
by the doorpost of the Lord 's temple.
10In bitterness of soul Hannah wept
much and prayed to the Lord .
11And she made a vow, saying, "O Lord
Almighty, if you will only look upon your
servant's misery and remember me, and
not forget your servant but give her a
son, then I will give him to the Lord for
all the days of his life, and no razor will
ever be used on his head."
12As she kept on praying to the Lord , Eli
observed her mouth.
13Hannah was praying in her heart, and
her lips were moving but her voice was
not heard. Eli thought she was drunk
14and said to her, "How long will you
keep on getting drunk? Get rid of your
wine."
15"Not so, my lord," Hannah replied, "I
am a woman who is deeply troubled. I
have not been drinking wine or beer; I
was pouring out my soul to the Lord .
16Do not take your servant for a wicked
woman; I have been praying here out of
my great anguish and grief."
17Eli answered, "Go in peace, and may
the God of Israel grant you what you
have asked of him."
18She said, "May your servant find favor
in your eyes." Then she went her way
and ate something, and her face was no
longer downcast.
19Early the next morning they arose and
worshiped before the Lord and then
went back to their home at Ramah.
Elkanah lay with Hannah his wife, and
the Lord remembered her.
20So in the course of time Hannah
conceived and gave birth to a son. She
named him Samuel, saying, "Because I
asked the Lord for him."
21When the man Elkanah went up with
all his family to offer the annual sacrifice
to the Lord and to fulfill his vow,
22Hannah did not go. She said to her
husband, "After the boy is weaned, I will
take him and present him before the
Lord , and he will live there always."
23"Do what seems best to you," Elkanah
her husband told her. "Stay here until
you have weaned him; only may the
Lord make good his word." So the
woman stayed at home and nursed her
son until she had weaned him.
24After he was weaned, she took the boy
with her, young as he was, along with a
three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour
and a skin of wine, and brought him to
the house of the Lord at Shiloh.
25When they had slaughtered the bull,
they brought the boy to Eli,
26and she said to him, "As surely as you
live, my lord, I am the woman who stood
here beside you praying to the Lord .
27I prayed for this child, and the Lord
has granted me what I asked of him.
28So now I give him to the Lord . For his
whole life he will be given over to the
Lord ." And he worshiped the Lord there.
2Then Hannah prayed and said: "My
heart rejoices in the Lord ; in the Lord
my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts
over my enemies, for I delight in your
deliverance.
2"There is no one holy like the Lord ;
there is no one besides you; there is no
Rock like our God.
3"Do not keep talking so proudly or let
your mouth speak such arrogance, for
the Lord is a God who knows, and by
him deeds are weighed.
4"The bows of the warriors are broken,
but those who stumbled are armed with
strength.
5Those who were full hire themselves
out for food, but those who were hungry
hunger no more. She who was barren
has borne seven children, but she who
has had many sons pines away.
6"The Lord brings death and makes
alive; he brings down to the grave and
raises up.
7The Lord sends poverty and wealth; he
humbles and he exalts.
8He raises the poor from the dust and
lifts the needy from the ash heap; he
seats them with princes and has them
inherit a throne of honor. "For the
foundations of the earth are the Lord 's;
upon them he has set the world.
9He will guard the feet of his saints, but
the wicked will be silenced in darkness.
"It is not by strength that one prevails;
10those who oppose the Lord will be
shattered. He will thunder against them
from heaven; the Lord will judge the
ends of the earth. "He will give strength
to his king and exalt the horn of his
anointed."
11Then Elkanah went home to Ramah,
but the boy ministered before the Lord
under Eli the priest.
12Eli's sons were wicked men; they had
no regard for the Lord .
13Now it was the practice of the priests
with the people that whenever anyone
offered a sacrifice and while the meat
was being boiled, the servant of the
priest would come with a three-pronged
fork in his hand.
14He would plunge it into the pan or
kettle or caldron or pot, and the priest
would take for himself whatever the fork
brought up. This is how they treated all
the Israelites who came to Shiloh.
15But even before the fat was burned,
the servant of the priest would come
and say to the man who was sacrificing,
"Give the priest some meat to roast; he
won't accept boiled meat from you, but
only raw."
16If the man said to him, "Let the fat be
burned up first, and then take whatever
you want," the servant would then
answer, "No, hand it over now; if you
don't, I'll take it by force."
17This sin of the young men was very
great in the Lord 's sight, for they were
treating the Lord 's offering with
contempt.
18But Samuel was ministering before the
Lord -a boy wearing a linen ephod.
19Each year his mother made him a little
robe and took it to him when she went
up with her husband to offer the annual
sacrifice.
20Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife,
saying, "May the Lord give you children
by this woman to take the place of the
one she prayed for and gave to the
Lord ." Then they would go home.
21And the Lord was gracious to Hannah;
she conceived and gave birth to three
sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the
boy Samuel grew up in the presence of
the Lord .
22Now Eli, who was very old, heard
about everything his sons were doing to
all Israel and how they slept with the
women who served at the entrance to
the Tent of Meeting.
23So he said to them, "Why do you do
such things? I hear from all the people
about these wicked deeds of yours.
24No, my sons; it is not a good report
that I hear spreading among the Lord 's
people.
25If a man sins against another man,
God may mediate for him; but if a man
sins against the Lord , who will intercede
for him?" His sons, however, did not
listen to their father's rebuke, for it was
the Lord 's will to put them to death.
26And the boy Samuel continued to grow
in stature and in favor with the Lord and
with men.
27Now a man of God came to Eli and
said to him, "This is what the Lord says:
'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your
father's house when they were in Egypt
under Pharaoh?
28I chose your father out of all the tribes
of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my
altar, to burn incense, and to wear an
ephod in my presence. I also gave your
father's house all the offerings made
with fire by the Israelites.
29Why do you scorn my sacrifice and
offering that I prescribed for my
dwelling? Why do you honor your sons
more than me by fattening yourselves
on the choice parts of every offering
made by my people Israel?'
30"Therefore the Lord , the God of Israel,
declares: 'I promised that your house
and your father's house would minister
before me forever.' But now the Lord
declares: 'Far be it from me! Those who
honor me I will honor, but those who
despise me will be disdained.
31The time is coming when I will cut
short your strength and the strength of
your father's house, so that there will not
be an old man in your family line
32and you will see distress in my
dwelling. Although good will be done to
Israel, in your family line there will never
be an old man.
33Every one of you that I do not cut off
from my altar will be spared only to blind
your eyes with tears and to grieve your
heart, and all your descendants will die
in the prime of life.
34" 'And what happens to your two sons,
Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to
you-they will both die on the same day.
35I will raise up for myself a faithful priest,
who will do according to what is in my
heart and mind. I will firmly establish his
house, and he will minister before my
anointed one always.
36Then everyone left in your family line
will come and bow down before him for
a piece of silver and a crust of bread
and plead, "Appoint me to some priestly
office so I can have food to eat." ' "
3The boy Samuel ministered before
the Lord under Eli. In those days the
word of the Lord was rare; there were
not many visions.
2One night Eli, whose eyes were
becoming so weak that he could barely
see, was lying down in his usual place.
3The lamp of God had not yet gone out,
and Samuel was lying down in the
temple of the Lord , where the ark of
God was.
4Then the Lord called Samuel. Samuel
answered, "Here I am."
5And he ran to Eli and said, "Here I am;
you called me." But Eli said, "I did not
call; go back and lie down." So he went
and lay down.
6Again the Lord called, "Samuel!" And
Samuel got up and went to Eli and said,
"Here I am; you called me." "My son," Eli
said, "I did not call; go back and lie
down."
7Now Samuel did not yet know the
Lord : The word of the Lord had not yet
been revealed to him.
8The Lord called Samuel a third time,
and Samuel got up and went to Eli and
said, "Here I am; you called me." Then
Eli realized that the Lord was calling the
boy.
9So Eli told Samuel, "Go and lie down,
and if he calls you, say, 'Speak, Lord ,
for your servant is listening.' " So
Samuel went and lay down in his place.
10The Lord came and stood there,
calling as at the other times, "Samuel!
Samuel!" Then Samuel said, "Speak, for
your servant is listening."
11And the Lord said to Samuel: "See, I
am about to do something in Israel that
will make the ears of everyone who
hears of it tingle.
12At that time I will carry out against Eli
everything I spoke against his familyfrom
beginning to end.
13For I told him that I would judge his
family forever because of the sin he
knew about; his sons made themselves
contemptible, and he failed to restrain
them.
14Therefore, I swore to the house of Eli,
'The guilt of Eli's house will never be
atoned for by sacrifice or offering.' "
15Samuel lay down until morning and
then opened the doors of the house of
the Lord . He was afraid to tell Eli the
vision,
16but Eli called him and said, "Samuel,
my son." Samuel answered, "Here I
am."
17"What was it he said to you?" Eli asked.
"Do not hide it from me. May God deal
with you, be it ever so severely, if you
hide from me anything he told you."
18So Samuel told him everything, hiding
nothing from him. Then Eli said, "He is
the Lord ; let him do what is good in his
eyes."
19The Lord was with Samuel as he grew
up, and he let none of his words fall to
the ground.
20And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba
recognized that Samuel was attested as
a prophet of the Lord .
21The Lord continued to appear at
Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to
Samuel through his word.
4And Samuel's word came to all Israel.
Now the Israelites went out to fight
against the Philistines. The Israelites
camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines
at Aphek.
2The Philistines deployed their forces to
meet Israel, and as the battle spread,
Israel was defeated by the Philistines,
who killed about four thousand of them
on the battlefield.
3When the soldiers returned to camp,
the elders of Israel asked, "Why did the
Lord bring defeat upon us today before
the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of
the Lord 's covenant from Shiloh, so that
it may go with us and save us from the
hand of our enemies."
4So the people sent men to Shiloh, and
they brought back the ark of the
covenant of the Lord Almighty, who is
enthroned between the cherubim. And
Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas,
were there with the ark of the covenant
of God.
5When the ark of the Lord 's covenant
came into the camp, all Israel raised
such a great shout that the ground
shook.
6Hearing the uproar, the Philistines
asked, "What's all this shouting in the
Hebrew camp?" When they learned that
the ark of the Lord had come into the
camp,
7the Philistines were afraid. "A god has
come into the camp," they said. "We're
in trouble! Nothing like this has
happened before.
8Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the
hand of these mighty gods? They are
the gods who struck the Egyptians with
all kinds of plagues in the desert.
9Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you
will be subject to the Hebrews, as they
have been to you. Be men, and fight!"
10So the Philistines fought, and the
Israelites were defeated and every man
fled to his tent. The slaughter was very
great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot
soldiers.
11The ark of God was captured, and Eli's
two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
12That same day a Benjamite ran from
the battle line and went to Shiloh, his
clothes torn and dust on his head.
13When he arrived, there was Eli sitting
on his chair by the side of the road,
watching, because his heart feared for
the ark of God. When the man entered
the town and told what had happened,
the whole town sent up a cry.
14Eli heard the outcry and asked, "What
is the meaning of this uproar?" The man
hurried over to Eli,
15who was ninety-eight years old and
whose eyes were set so that he could
not see.
16He told Eli, "I have just come from the
battle line; I fled from it this very day." Eli
asked, "What happened, my son?"
17The man who brought the news
replied, "Israel fled before the Philistines,
and the army has suffered heavy losses.
Also your two sons, Hophni and
Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God
has been captured."
18When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli
fell backward off his chair by the side of
the gate. His neck was broken and he
died, for he was an old man and heavy.
He had led Israel forty years.
19His daughter-in-law, the wife of
Phinehas, was pregnant and near the
time of delivery. When she heard the
news that the ark of God had been
captured and that her father-in-law and
her husband were dead, she went into
labor and gave birth, but was overcome
by her labor pains.
20As she was dying, the women
attending her said, "Don't despair; you
have given birth to a son." But she did
not respond or pay any attention.
21She named the boy Ichabod, saying,
"The glory has departed from Israel"-
because of the capture of the ark of God
and the deaths of her father-in-law and
her husband.
22She said, "The glory has departed
from Israel, for the ark of God has been
captured."
5After the Philistines had captured the
ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer
to Ashdod.
2Then they carried the ark into Dagon's
temple and set it beside Dagon.
3When the people of Ashdod rose early
the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on
his face on the ground before the ark of
the Lord ! They took Dagon and put him
back in his place.
4But the following morning when they
rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his
face on the ground before the ark of the
Lord ! His head and hands had been
broken off and were lying on the
threshold; only his body remained.
5That is why to this day neither the
priests of Dagon nor any others who
enter Dagon's temple at Ashdod step on
the threshold.
6The Lord 's hand was heavy upon the
people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he
brought devastation upon them and
afflicted them with tumors.
7When the men of Ashdod saw what
was happening, they said, "The ark of
the god of Israel must not stay here with
us, because his hand is heavy upon us
and upon Dagon our god."
8So they called together all the rulers of
the Philistines and asked them, "What
shall we do with the ark of the god of
Israel?" They answered, "Have the ark
of the god of Israel moved to Gath." So
they moved the ark of the God of Israel.
9But after they had moved it, the Lord 's
hand was against that city, throwing it
into a great panic. He afflicted the
people of the city, both young and old,
with an outbreak of tumors.
10So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.
As the ark of God was entering Ekron,
the people of Ekron cried out, "They
have brought the ark of the god of Israel
around to us to kill us and our people."
11So they called together all the rulers of
the Philistines and said, "Send the ark of
the god of Israel away; let it go back to
its own place, or it will kill us and our
people." For death had filled the city with
panic; God's hand was very heavy upon
it.
12Those who did not die were afflicted
with tumors, and the outcry of the city
went up to heaven.
6When the ark of the Lord had been in
Philistine territory seven months,
2the Philistines called for the priests and
the diviners and said, "What shall we do
with the ark of the Lord ? Tell us how we
should send it back to its place."
3They answered, "If you return the ark of
the god of Israel, do not send it away
empty, but by all means send a guilt
offering to him. Then you will be healed,
and you will know why his hand has not
been lifted from you."
4The Philistines asked, "What guilt
offering should we send to him?" They
replied, "Five gold tumors and five gold
rats, according to the number of the
Philistine rulers, because the same
plague has struck both you and your
rulers.
5Make models of the tumors and of the
rats that are destroying the country, and
pay honor to Israel's god. Perhaps he
will lift his hand from you and your gods
and your land.
6Why do you harden your hearts as the
Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When he
treated them harshly, did they not send
the Israelites out so they could go on
their way?
7"Now then, get a new cart ready, with
two cows that have calved and have
never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the
cart, but take their calves away and pen
them up.
8Take the ark of the Lord and put it on
the cart, and in a chest beside it put the
gold objects you are sending back to
him as a guilt offering. Send it on its way,
9but keep watching it. If it goes up to its
own territory, toward Beth Shemesh,
then the Lord has brought this great
disaster on us. But if it does not, then
we will know that it was not his hand
that struck us and that it happened to us
by chance."
10So they did this. They took two such
cows and hitched them to the cart and
penned up their calves.
11They placed the ark of the Lord on the
cart and along with it the chest
containing the gold rats and the models
of the tumors.
12Then the cows went straight up toward
Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and
lowing all the way; they did not turn to
the right or to the left. The rulers of the
Philistines followed them as far as the
border of Beth Shemesh.
13Now the people of Beth Shemesh
were harvesting their wheat in the valley,
and when they looked up and saw the
ark, they rejoiced at the sight.
14The cart came to the field of Joshua of
Beth Shemesh, and there it stopped
beside a large rock. The people
chopped up the wood of the cart and
sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to
the Lord .
15The Levites took down the ark of the
Lord , together with the chest containing
the gold objects, and placed them on
the large rock. On that day the people of
Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings
and made sacrifices to the Lord .
16The five rulers of the Philistines saw all
this and then returned that same day to
Ekron.
17These are the gold tumors the
Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the
Lord -one each for Ashdod, Gaza,
Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron.
18And the number of the gold rats was
according to the number of Philistine
towns belonging to the five rulers-the
fortified towns with their country villages.
The large rock, on which they set the
ark of the Lord , is a witness to this day
in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.
19But God struck down some of the men
of Beth Shemesh, putting seventy of
them to death because they had looked
into the ark of the Lord . The people
mourned because of the heavy blow the
Lord had dealt them,
20and the men of Beth Shemesh asked,
"Who can stand in the presence of the
Lord , this holy God? To whom will the
ark go up from here?"
21Then they sent messengers to the
people of Kiriath Jearim, saying, "The
Philistines have returned the ark of the
Lord . Come down and take it up to your
place."
7So the men of Kiriath Jearim came
and took up the ark of the Lord . They
took it to Abinadab's house on the hill
and consecrated Eleazar his son to
guard the ark of the Lord .
2It was a long time, twenty years in all,
that the ark remained at Kiriath Jearim,
and all the people of Israel mourned and
sought after the Lord .
3And Samuel said to the whole house of
Israel, "If you are returning to the Lord
with all your hearts, then rid yourselves
of the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths
and commit yourselves to the Lord and
serve him only, and he will deliver you
out of the hand of the Philistines."
4So the Israelites put away their Baals
and Ashtoreths, and served the Lord
only.
5Then Samuel said, "Assemble all Israel
at Mizpah and I will intercede with the
Lord for you."
6When they had assembled at Mizpah,
they drew water and poured it out before
the Lord . On that day they fasted and
there they confessed, "We have sinned
against the Lord ." And Samuel was
leader of Israel at Mizpah.
7When the Philistines heard that Israel
had assembled at Mizpah, the rulers of
the Philistines came up to attack them.
And when the Israelites heard of it, they
were afraid because of the Philistines.
8They said to Samuel, "Do not stop
crying out to the Lord our God for us,
that he may rescue us from the hand of
the Philistines."
9Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and
offered it up as a whole burnt offering to
the Lord . He cried out to the Lord on
Israel's behalf, and the Lord answered
him.
10While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt
offering, the Philistines drew near to
engage Israel in battle. But that day the
Lord thundered with loud thunder
against the Philistines and threw them
into such a panic that they were routed
before the Israelites.
11The men of Israel rushed out of
Mizpah and pursued the Philistines,
slaughtering them along the way to a
point below Beth Car.
12Then Samuel took a stone and set it
up between Mizpah and Shen. He
named it Ebenezer, saying, "Thus far
has the Lord helped us."
13So the Philistines were subdued and
did not invade Israelite territory again.
Throughout Samuel's lifetime, the hand
of the Lord was against the Philistines.
14The towns from Ekron to Gath that the
Philistines had captured from Israel
were restored to her, and Israel
delivered the neighboring territory from
the power of the Philistines. And there
was peace between Israel and the
Amorites.
15Samuel continued as judge over Israel
all the days of his life.
16From year to year he went on a circuit
from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging
Israel in all those places.
17But he always went back to Ramah,
where his home was, and there he also
judged Israel. And he built an altar there
to the Lord .
8When Samuel grew old, he
appointed his sons as judges for Israel.
2The name of his firstborn was Joel and
the name of his second was Abijah, and
they served at Beersheba.
3But his sons did not walk in his ways.
They turned aside after dishonest gain
and accepted bribes and perverted
justice.
4So all the elders of Israel gathered
together and came to Samuel at Ramah.
5They said to him, "You are old, and
your sons do not walk in your ways; now
appoint a king to lead us, such as all the
other nations have."
6But when they said, "Give us a king to
lead us," this displeased Samuel; so he
prayed to the Lord .
7And the Lord told him: "Listen to all that
the people are saying to you; it is not
you they have rejected, but they have
rejected me as their king.
8As they have done from the day I
brought them up out of Egypt until this
day, forsaking me and serving other
gods, so they are doing to you.
9Now listen to them; but warn them
solemnly and let them know what the
king who will reign over them will do."
10Samuel told all the words of the Lord
to the people who were asking him for a
king.
11He said, "This is what the king who will
reign over you will do: He will take your
sons and make them serve with his
chariots and horses, and they will run in
front of his chariots.
12Some he will assign to be
commanders of thousands and
commanders of fifties, and others to
plow his ground and reap his harvest,
and still others to make weapons of war
and equipment for his chariots.
13He will take your daughters to be
perfumers and cooks and bakers.
14He will take the best of your fields and
vineyards and olive groves and give
them to his attendants.
15He will take a tenth of your grain and
of your vintage and give it to his officials
and attendants.
16Your menservants and maidservants
and the best of your cattle and donkeys
he will take for his own use.
17He will take a tenth of your flocks, and
you yourselves will become his slaves.
18When that day comes, you will cry out
for relief from the king you have chosen,
and the Lord will not answer you in that
day."
19But the people refused to listen to
Samuel. "No!" they said. "We want a
king over us.
20Then we will be like all the other
nations, with a king to lead us and to go
out before us and fight our battles."
21When Samuel heard all that the
people said, he repeated it before the
Lord .
22The Lord answered, "Listen to them
and give them a king." Then Samuel
said to the men of Israel, "Everyone go
back to his town."
9There was a Benjamite, a man of
standing, whose name was Kish son of
Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of
Becorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin.
2He had a son named Saul, an
impressive young man without equal
among the Israelites-a head taller than
any of the others.
3Now the donkeys belonging to Saul's
father Kish were lost, and Kish said to
his son Saul, "Take one of the servants
with you and go and look for the
donkeys."
4So he passed through the hill country of
Ephraim and through the area around
Shalisha, but they did not find them.
They went on into the district of Shaalim,
but the donkeys were not there. Then he
passed through the territory of Benjamin,
but they did not find them.
5When they reached the district of Zuph,
Saul said to the servant who was with
him, "Come, let's go back, or my father
will stop thinking about the donkeys and
start worrying about us."
6But the servant replied, "Look, in this
town there is a man of God; he is highly
respected, and everything he says
comes true. Let's go there now. Perhaps
he will tell us what way to take."
7Saul said to his servant, "If we go, what
can we give the man? The food in our
sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to
the man of God. What do we have?"
8The servant answered him again.
"Look," he said, "I have a quarter of a
shekel of silver. I will give it to the man
of God so that he will tell us what way to
take."
9(Formerly in Israel, if a man went to
inquire of God, he would say, "Come, let
us go to the seer," because the prophet
of today used to be called a seer.)
10"Good," Saul said to his servant.
"Come, let's go." So they set out for the
town where the man of God was.
11As they were going up the hill to the
town, they met some girls coming out to
draw water, and they asked them, "Is
the seer here?"
12"He is," they answered. "He's ahead of
you. Hurry now; he has just come to our
town today, for the people have a
sacrifice at the high place.
13As soon as you enter the town, you
will find him before he goes up to the
high place to eat. The people will not
begin eating until he comes, because he
must bless the sacrifice; afterward,
those who are invited will eat. Go up
now; you should find him about this
time."
14They went up to the town, and as they
were entering it, there was Samuel,
coming toward them on his way up to
the high place.
15Now the day before Saul came, the
Lord had revealed this to Samuel:
16"About this time tomorrow I will send
you a man from the land of Benjamin.
Anoint him leader over my people Israel;
he will deliver my people from the hand
of the Philistines. I have looked upon my
people, for their cry has reached me."
17When Samuel caught sight of Saul,
the Lord said to him, "This is the man I
spoke to you about; he will govern my
people."
18Saul approached Samuel in the
gateway and asked, "Would you please
tell me where the seer's house is?"
19"I am the seer," Samuel replied. "Go
up ahead of me to the high place, for
today you are to eat with me, and in the
morning I will let you go and will tell you
all that is in your heart.
20As for the donkeys you lost three days
ago, do not worry about them; they have
been found. And to whom is all the
desire of Israel turned, if not to you and
all your father's family?"
21Saul answered, "But am I not a
Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of
Israel, and is not my clan the least of all
the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why
do you say such a thing to me?"
22Then Samuel brought Saul and his
servant into the hall and seated them at
the head of those who were invitedabout
thirty in number.
23Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the
piece of meat I gave you, the one I told
you to lay aside."
24So the cook took up the leg with what
was on it and set it in front of Saul.
Samuel said, "Here is what has been
kept for you. Eat, because it was set
aside for you for this occasion, from the
time I said, 'I have invited guests.' " And
Saul dined with Samuel that day.
25After they came down from the high
place to the town, Samuel talked with
Saul on the roof of his house.
26They rose about daybreak and Samuel
called to Saul on the roof, "Get ready,
and I will send you on your way." When
Saul got ready, he and Samuel went
outside together.
27As they were going down to the edge
of the town, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell
the servant to go on ahead of us"-and
the servant did so-"but you stay here
awhile, so that I may give you a
message from God."
10Then Samuel took a flask of oil
and poured it on Saul's head and kissed
him, saying, "Has not the Lord anointed
you leader over his inheritance?
2When you leave me today, you will
meet two men near Rachel's tomb, at
Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They
will say to you, 'The donkeys you set out
to look for have been found. And now
your father has stopped thinking about
them and is worried about you. He is
asking, "What shall I do about my son?"
'
3"Then you will go on from there until
you reach the great tree of Tabor. Three
men going up to God at Bethel will meet
you there. One will be carrying three
young goats, another three loaves of
bread, and another a skin of wine.
4They will greet you and offer you two
loaves of bread, which you will accept
from them.
5"After that you will go to Gibeah of God,
where there is a Philistine outpost. As
you approach the town, you will meet a
procession of prophets coming down
from the high place with lyres,
tambourines, flutes and harps being
played before them, and they will be
prophesying.
6The Spirit of the Lord will come upon
you in power, and you will prophesy with
them; and you will be changed into a
different person.
7Once these signs are fulfilled, do
whatever your hand finds to do, for God
is with you.
8"Go down ahead of me to Gilgal. I will
surely come down to you to sacrifice
burnt offerings and fellowship offerings,
but you must wait seven days until I
come to you and tell you what you are to
do."
9As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God
changed Saul's heart, and all these
signs were fulfilled that day.
10When they arrived at Gibeah, a
procession of prophets met him; the
Spirit of God came upon him in power,
and he joined in their prophesying.
11When all those who had formerly
known him saw him prophesying with
the prophets, they asked each other,
"What is this that has happened to the
son of Kish? Is Saul also among the
prophets?"
12A man who lived there answered, "And
who is their father?" So it became a
saying: "Is Saul also among the
prophets?"
13After Saul stopped prophesying, he
went to the high place.
14Now Saul's uncle asked him and his
servant, "Where have you been?"
"Looking for the donkeys," he said. "But
when we saw they were not to be found,
we went to Samuel."
15Saul's uncle said, "Tell me what
Samuel said to you."
16Saul replied, "He assured us that the
donkeys had been found." But he did
not tell his uncle what Samuel had said
about the kingship.
17Samuel summoned the people of
Israel to the Lord at Mizpah
18and said to them, "This is what the
Lord , the God of Israel, says: 'I brought
Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered
you from the power of Egypt and all the
kingdoms that oppressed you.'
19But you have now rejected your God,
who saves you out of all your calamities
and distresses. And you have said, 'No,
set a king over us.' So now present
yourselves before the Lord by your
tribes and clans."
20When Samuel brought all the tribes of
Israel near, the tribe of Benjamin was
chosen.
21Then he brought forward the tribe of
Benjamin, clan by clan, and Matri's clan
was chosen. Finally Saul son of Kish
was chosen. But when they looked for
him, he was not to be found.
22So they inquired further of the Lord ,
"Has the man come here yet?" And the
Lord said, "Yes, he has hidden himself
among the baggage."
23They ran and brought him out, and as
he stood among the people he was a
head taller than any of the others.
24Samuel said to all the people, "Do you
see the man the Lord has chosen?
There is no one like him among all the
people." Then the people shouted,
"Long live the king!"
25Samuel explained to the people the
regulations of the kingship. He wrote
them down on a scroll and deposited it
before the Lord . Then Samuel
dismissed the people, each to his own
home.
26Saul also went to his home in Gibeah,
accompanied by valiant men whose
hearts God had touched.
27But some troublemakers said, "How
can this fellow save us?" They despised
him and brought him no gifts. But Saul
kept silent.
11Nahash the Ammonite went up
and besieged Jabesh Gilead. And all the
men of Jabesh said to him, "Make a
treaty with us, and we will be subject to
you."
2But Nahash the Ammonite replied, "I
will make a treaty with you only on the
condition that I gouge out the right eye
of every one of you and so bring
disgrace on all Israel."
3The elders of Jabesh said to him, "Give
us seven days so we can send
messengers throughout Israel; if no one
comes to rescue us, we will surrender to
you."
4When the messengers came to Gibeah
of Saul and reported these terms to the
people, they all wept aloud.
5Just then Saul was returning from the
fields, behind his oxen, and he asked,
"What is wrong with the people? Why
are they weeping?" Then they repeated
to him what the men of Jabesh had said.
6When Saul heard their words, the Spirit
of God came upon him in power, and he
burned with anger.
7He took a pair of oxen, cut them into
pieces, and sent the pieces by
messengers throughout Israel,
proclaiming, "This is what will be done to
the oxen of anyone who does not follow
Saul and Samuel." Then the terror of the
Lord fell on the people, and they turned
out as one man.
8When Saul mustered them at Bezek,
the men of Israel numbered three
hundred thousand and the men of
Judah thirty thousand.
9They told the messengers who had
come, "Say to the men of Jabesh Gilead,
'By the time the sun is hot tomorrow,
you will be delivered.' " When the
messengers went and reported this to
the men of Jabesh, they were elated.
10They said to the Ammonites,
"Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and
you can do to us whatever seems good
to you."
11The next day Saul separated his men
into three divisions; during the last
watch of the night they broke into the
camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered
them until the heat of the day. Those
who survived were scattered, so that no
two of them were left together.
12The people then said to Samuel, "Who
was it that asked, 'Shall Saul reign over
us?' Bring these men to us and we will
put them to death."
13But Saul said, "No one shall be put to
death today, for this day the Lord has
rescued Israel."
14Then Samuel said to the people,
"Come, let us go to Gilgal and there
reaffirm the kingship."
15So all the people went to Gilgal and
confirmed Saul as king in the presence
of the Lord . There they sacrificed
fellowship offerings before the Lord ,
and Saul and all the Israelites held a
great celebration.
12Samuel said to all Israel, "I have
listened to everything you said to me
and have set a king over you.
2Now you have a king as your leader. As
for me, I am old and gray, and my sons
are here with you. I have been your
leader from my youth until this day.
3Here I stand. Testify against me in the
presence of the Lord and his anointed.
Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey
have I taken? Whom have I cheated?
Whom have I oppressed? From whose
hand have I accepted a bribe to make
me shut my eyes? If I have done any of
these, I will make it right."
4"You have not cheated or oppressed
us," they replied. "You have not taken
anything from anyone's hand."
5Samuel said to them, "The Lord is
witness against you, and also his
anointed is witness this day, that you
have not found anything in my hand."
"He is witness," they said.
6Then Samuel said to the people, "It is
the Lord who appointed Moses and
Aaron and brought your forefathers up
out of Egypt.
7Now then, stand here, because I am
going to confront you with evidence
before the Lord as to all the righteous
acts performed by the Lord for you and
your fathers.
8"After Jacob entered Egypt, they cried
to the Lord for help, and the Lord sent
Moses and Aaron, who brought your
forefathers out of Egypt and settled
them in this place.
9"But they forgot the Lord their God; so
he sold them into the hand of Sisera, the
commander of the army of Hazor, and
into the hands of the Philistines and the
king of Moab, who fought against them.
10They cried out to the Lord and said,
'We have sinned; we have forsaken the
Lord and served the Baals and the
Ashtoreths. But now deliver us from the
hands of our enemies, and we will serve
you.'
11Then the Lord sent Jerub-Baal, Barak,
Jephthah and Samuel, and he delivered
you from the hands of your enemies on
every side, so that you lived securely.
12"But when you saw that Nahash king
of the Ammonites was moving against
you, you said to me, 'No, we want a king
to rule over us'-even though the Lord
your God was your king.
13Now here is the king you have chosen,
the one you asked for; see, the Lord has
set a king over you.
14If you fear the Lord and serve and
obey him and do not rebel against his
commands, and if both you and the king
who reigns over you follow the Lord your
God-good!
15But if you do not obey the Lord , and if
you rebel against his commands, his
hand will be against you, as it was
against your fathers.
16"Now then, stand still and see this
great thing the Lord is about to do
before your eyes!
17Is it not wheat harvest now? I will call
upon the Lord to send thunder and rain.
And you will realize what an evil thing
you did in the eyes of the Lord when you
asked for a king."
18Then Samuel called upon the Lord ,
and that same day the Lord sent
thunder and rain. So all the people
stood in awe of the Lord and of Samuel.
19The people all said to Samuel, "Pray to
the Lord your God for your servants so
that we will not die, for we have added
to all our other sins the evil of asking for
a king."
20"Do not be afraid," Samuel replied.
"You have done all this evil; yet do not
turn away from the Lord , but serve the
Lord with all your heart.
21Do not turn away after useless idols.
They can do you no good, nor can they
rescue you, because they are useless.
22For the sake of his great name the
Lord will not reject his people, because
the Lord was pleased to make you his
own.
23As for me, far be it from me that I
should sin against the Lord by failing to
pray for you. And I will teach you the
way that is good and right.
24But be sure to fear the Lord and serve
him faithfully with all your heart;
consider what great things he has done
for you.
25Yet if you persist in doing evil, both
you and your king will be swept away."
13Saul was thirty years old when he
became king, and he reigned over Israel
forty- two years.
2Saul chose three thousand men from
Israel; two thousand were with him at
Micmash and in the hill country of Bethel,
and a thousand were with Jonathan at
Gibeah in Benjamin. The rest of the men
he sent back to their homes.
3Jonathan attacked the Philistine
outpost at Geba, and the Philistines
heard about it. Then Saul had the
trumpet blown throughout the land and
said, "Let the Hebrews hear!"
4So all Israel heard the news: "Saul has
attacked the Philistine outpost, and now
Israel has become a stench to the
Philistines." And the people were
summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.
5The Philistines assembled to fight Israel,
with three thousand chariots, six
thousand charioteers, and soldiers as
numerous as the sand on the seashore.
They went up and camped at Micmash,
east of Beth Aven.
6When the men of Israel saw that their
situation was critical and that their army
was hard pressed, they hid in caves and
thickets, among the rocks, and in pits
and cisterns.
7Some Hebrews even crossed the
Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead.
Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the
troops with him were quaking with fear.
8He waited seven days, the time set by
Samuel; but Samuel did not come to
Gilgal, and Saul's men began to scatter.
9So he said, "Bring me the burnt offering
and the fellowship offerings. " And Saul
offered up the burnt offering.
10Just as he finished making the offering,
Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to
greet him.
11"What have you done?" asked Samuel.
Saul replied, "When I saw that the men
were scattering, and that you did not
come at the set time, and that the
Philistines were assembling at Micmash,
12I thought, 'Now the Philistines will
come down against me at Gilgal, and I
have not sought the Lord 's favor.' So I
felt compelled to offer the burnt
offering."
13"You acted foolishly," Samuel said.
"You have not kept the command the
Lord your God gave you; if you had, he
would have established your kingdom
over Israel for all time.
14But now your kingdom will not endure;
the Lord has sought out a man after his
own heart and appointed him leader of
his people, because you have not kept
the Lord 's command."
15Then Samuel left Gilgal and went up to
Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted
the men who were with him. They
numbered about six hundred.
16Saul and his son Jonathan and the
men with them were staying in Gibeah
in Benjamin, while the Philistines
camped at Micmash.
17Raiding parties went out from the
Philistine camp in three detachments.
One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity
of Shual,
18another toward Beth Horon, and the
third toward the borderland overlooking
the Valley of Zeboim facing the desert.
19Not a blacksmith could be found in the
whole land of Israel, because the
Philistines had said, "Otherwise the
Hebrews will make swords or spears!"
20So all Israel went down to the
Philistines to have their plowshares,
mattocks, axes and sickles sharpened.
21The price was two thirds of a shekel
for sharpening plowshares and mattocks,
and a third of a shekel for sharpening
forks and axes and for repointing goads.
22So on the day of the battle not a
soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a
sword or spear in his hand; only Saul
and his son Jonathan had them.
23Now a detachment of Philistines had
gone out to the pass at Micmash.
14One day Jonathan son of Saul
said to the young man bearing his armor,
"Come, let's go over to the Philistine
outpost on the other side." But he did
not tell his father.
2Saul was staying on the outskirts of
Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in
Migron. With him were about six
hundred men,
3among whom was Ahijah, who was
wearing an ephod. He was a son of
Ichabod's brother Ahitub son of
Phinehas, the son of Eli, the Lord 's
priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that
Jonathan had left.
4On each side of the pass that Jonathan
intended to cross to reach the Philistine
outpost was a cliff; one was called
Bozez, and the other Seneh.
5One cliff stood to the north toward
Micmash, the other to the south toward
Geba.
6Jonathan said to his young armorbearer,
"Come, let's go over to the
outpost of those uncircumcised fellows.
Perhaps the Lord will act in our behalf.
Nothing can hinder the Lord from saving,
whether by many or by few."
7"Do all that you have in mind," his
armor-bearer said. "Go ahead; I am with
you heart and soul."
8Jonathan said, "Come, then; we will
cross over toward the men and let them
see us.
9If they say to us, 'Wait there until we
come to you,' we will stay where we are
and not go up to them.
10But if they say, 'Come up to us,' we will
climb up, because that will be our sign
that the Lord has given them into our
hands."
11So both of them showed themselves to
the Philistine outpost. "Look!" said the
Philistines. "The Hebrews are crawling
out of the holes they were hiding in."
12The men of the outpost shouted to
Jonathan and his armor-bearer, "Come
up to us and we'll teach you a lesson."
So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer,
"Climb up after me; the Lord has given
them into the hand of Israel."
13Jonathan climbed up, using his hands
and feet, with his armor-bearer right
behind him. The Philistines fell before
Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed
and killed behind him.
14In that first attack Jonathan and his
armor-bearer killed some twenty men in
an area of about half an acre.
15Then panic struck the whole armythose
in the camp and field, and those in
the outposts and raiding parties-and the
ground shook. It was a panic sent by
God.
16Saul's lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin
saw the army melting away in all
directions.
17Then Saul said to the men who were
with him, "Muster the forces and see
who has left us." When they did, it was
Jonathan and his armor-bearer who
were not there.
18Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ark of
God." (At that time it was with the
Israelites.)
19While Saul was talking to the priest,
the tumult in the Philistine camp
increased more and more. So Saul said
to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."
20Then Saul and all his men assembled
and went to the battle. They found the
Philistines in total confusion, striking
each other with their swords.
21Those Hebrews who had previously
been with the Philistines and had gone
up with them to their camp went over to
the Israelites who were with Saul and
Jonathan.
22When all the Israelites who had hidden
in the hill country of Ephraim heard that
the Philistines were on the run, they
joined the battle in hot pursuit.
23So the Lord rescued Israel that day,
and the battle moved on beyond Beth
Aven.
24Now the men of Israel were in distress
that day, because Saul had bound the
people under an oath, saying, "Cursed
be any man who eats food before
evening comes, before I have avenged
myself on my enemies!" So none of the
troops tasted food.
25The entire army entered the woods,
and there was honey on the ground.
26When they went into the woods, they
saw the honey oozing out, yet no one
put his hand to his mouth, because they
feared the oath.
27But Jonathan had not heard that his
father had bound the people with the
oath, so he reached out the end of the
staff that was in his hand and dipped it
into the honeycomb. He raised his hand
to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.
28Then one of the soldiers told him,
"Your father bound the army under a
strict oath, saying, 'Cursed be any man
who eats food today!' That is why the
men are faint."
29Jonathan said, "My father has made
trouble for the country. See how my
eyes brightened when I tasted a little of
this honey.
30How much better it would have been if
the men had eaten today some of the
plunder they took from their enemies.
Would not the slaughter of the
Philistines have been even greater?"
31That day, after the Israelites had
struck down the Philistines from
Micmash to Aijalon, they were
exhausted.
32They pounced on the plunder and,
taking sheep, cattle and calves, they
butchered them on the ground and ate
them, together with the blood.
33Then someone said to Saul, "Look, the
men are sinning against the Lord by
eating meat that has blood in it." "You
have broken faith," he said. "Roll a large
stone over here at once."
34Then he said, "Go out among the men
and tell them, 'Each of you bring me
your cattle and sheep, and slaughter
them here and eat them. Do not sin
against the Lord by eating meat with
blood still in it.' " So everyone brought
his ox that night and slaughtered it there.
35Then Saul built an altar to the Lord ; it
was the first time he had done this.
36Saul said, "Let us go down after the
Philistines by night and plunder them till
dawn, and let us not leave one of them
alive." "Do whatever seems best to you,"
they replied. But the priest said, "Let us
inquire of God here."
37So Saul asked God, "Shall I go down
after the Philistines? Will you give them
into Israel's hand?" But God did not
answer him that day.
38Saul therefore said, "Come here, all
you who are leaders of the army, and let
us find out what sin has been committed
today.
39As surely as the Lord who rescues
Israel lives, even if it lies with my son
Jonathan, he must die." But not one of
the men said a word.
40Saul then said to all the Israelites,
"You stand over there; I and Jonathan
my son will stand over here." "Do what
seems best to you," the men replied.
41Then Saul prayed to the Lord , the
God of Israel, "Give me the right
answer." And Jonathan and Saul were
taken by lot, and the men were cleared.
42Saul said, "Cast the lot between me
and Jonathan my son." And Jonathan
was taken.
43Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me
what you have done." So Jonathan told
him, "I merely tasted a little honey with
the end of my staff. And now must I
die?"
44Saul said, "May God deal with me, be
it ever so severely, if you do not die,
Jonathan."
45But the men said to Saul, "Should
Jonathan die-he who has brought about
this great deliverance in Israel? Never!
As surely as the Lord lives, not a hair of
his head will fall to the ground, for he did
this today with God's help." So the men
rescued Jonathan, and he was not put
to death.
46Then Saul stopped pursuing the
Philistines, and they withdrew to their
own land.
47After Saul had assumed rule over
Israel, he fought against their enemies
on every side: Moab, the Ammonites,
Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the
Philistines. Wherever he turned, he
inflicted punishment on them.
48He fought valiantly and defeated the
Amalekites, delivering Israel from the
hands of those who had plundered them.
49Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishvi and
Malki-Shua. The name of his older
daughter was Merab, and that of the
younger was Michal.
50His wife's name was Ahinoam
daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the
commander of Saul's army was Abner
son of Ner, and Ner was Saul's uncle.
51Saul's father Kish and Abner's father
Ner were sons of Abiel.
52All the days of Saul there was bitter
war with the Philistines, and whenever
Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he
took him into his service.
15Samuel said to Saul, "I am the
one the Lord sent to anoint you king
over his people Israel; so listen now to
the message from the Lord .
2This is what the Lord Almighty says: 'I
will punish the Amalekites for what they
did to Israel when they waylaid them as
they came up from Egypt.
3Now go, attack the Amalekites and
totally destroy everything that belongs to
them. Do not spare them; put to death
men and women, children and infants,
cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.'
"
4So Saul summoned the men and
mustered them at Telaim-two hundred
thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand
men from Judah.
5Saul went to the city of Amalek and set
an ambush in the ravine.
6Then he said to the Kenites, "Go away,
leave the Amalekites so that I do not
destroy you along with them; for you
showed kindness to all the Israelites
when they came up out of Egypt." So
the Kenites moved away from the
Amalekites.
7Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all
the way from Havilah to Shur, to the
east of Egypt.
8He took Agag king of the Amalekites
alive, and all his people he totally
destroyed with the sword.
9But Saul and the army spared Agag
and the best of the sheep and cattle, the
fat calves and lambs-everything that
was good. These they were unwilling to
destroy completely, but everything that
was despised and weak they totally
destroyed.
10Then the word of the Lord came to
Samuel:
11"I am grieved that I have made Saul
king, because he has turned away from
me and has not carried out my
instructions." Samuel was troubled, and
he cried out to the Lord all that night.
12Early in the morning Samuel got up
and went to meet Saul, but he was told,
"Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has
set up a monument in his own honor
and has turned and gone on down to
Gilgal."
13When Samuel reached him, Saul said,
"The Lord bless you! I have carried out
the Lord 's instructions."
14But Samuel said, "What then is this
bleating of sheep in my ears? What is
this lowing of cattle that I hear?"
15Saul answered, "The soldiers brought
them from the Amalekites; they spared
the best of the sheep and cattle to
sacrifice to the Lord your God, but we
totally destroyed the rest."
16"Stop!" Samuel said to Saul. "Let me
tell you what the Lord said to me last
night." "Tell me," Saul replied.
17Samuel said, "Although you were once
small in your own eyes, did you not
become the head of the tribes of Israel?
The Lord anointed you king over Israel.
18And he sent you on a mission, saying,
'Go and completely destroy those
wicked people, the Amalekites; make
war on them until you have wiped them
out.'
19Why did you not obey the Lord ? Why
did you pounce on the plunder and do
evil in the eyes of the Lord ?"
20"But I did obey the Lord ," Saul said. "I
went on the mission the Lord assigned
me. I completely destroyed the
Amalekites and brought back Agag their
king.
21The soldiers took sheep and cattle
from the plunder, the best of what was
devoted to God, in order to sacrifice
them to the Lord your God at Gilgal."
22But Samuel replied: "Does the Lord
delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices
as much as in obeying the voice of the
Lord ? To obey is better than sacrifice,
and to heed is better than the fat of
rams.
23For rebellion is like the sin of divination,
and arrogance like the evil of idolatry.
Because you have rejected the word of
the Lord , he has rejected you as king."
24Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have
sinned. I violated the Lord 's command
and your instructions. I was afraid of the
people and so I gave in to them.
25Now I beg you, forgive my sin and
come back with me, so that I may
worship the Lord ."
26But Samuel said to him, "I will not go
back with you. You have rejected the
word of the Lord , and the Lord has
rejected you as king over Israel!"
27As Samuel turned to leave, Saul
caught hold of the hem of his robe, and
it tore.
28Samuel said to him, "The Lord has
torn the kingdom of Israel from you
today and has given it to one of your
neighbors-to one better than you.
29He who is the Glory of Israel does not
lie or change his mind; for he is not a
man, that he should change his mind."
30Saul replied, "I have sinned. But
please honor me before the elders of my
people and before Israel; come back
with me, so that I may worship the Lord
your God."
31So Samuel went back with Saul, and
Saul worshiped the Lord .
32Then Samuel said, "Bring me Agag
king of the Amalekites." Agag came to
him confidently, thinking, "Surely the
bitterness of death is past."
33But Samuel said, "As your sword has
made women childless, so will your
mother be childless among women."
And Samuel put Agag to death before
the Lord at Gilgal.
34Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul
went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul.
35Until the day Samuel died, he did not
go to see Saul again, though Samuel
mourned for him. And the Lord was
grieved that he had made Saul king over
Israel.
16The Lord said to Samuel, "How
long will you mourn for Saul, since I
have rejected him as king over Israel?
Fill your horn with oil and be on your
way; I am sending you to Jesse of
Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his
sons to be king."
2But Samuel said, "How can I go? Saul
will hear about it and kill me." The Lord
said, "Take a heifer with you and say, 'I
have come to sacrifice to the Lord .'
3Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will
show you what to do. You are to anoint
for me the one I indicate."
4Samuel did what the Lord said. When
he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of
the town trembled when they met him.
They asked, "Do you come in peace?"
5Samuel replied, "Yes, in peace; I have
come to sacrifice to the Lord .
Consecrate yourselves and come to the
sacrifice with me." Then he consecrated
Jesse and his sons and invited them to
the sacrifice.
6When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab
and thought, "Surely the Lord 's
anointed stands here before the Lord ."
7But the Lord said to Samuel, "Do not
consider his appearance or his height,
for I have rejected him. The Lord does
not look at the things man looks at. Man
looks at the outward appearance, but
the Lord looks at the heart."
8Then Jesse called Abinadab and had
him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel
said, "The Lord has not chosen this one
either."
9Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but
Samuel said, "Nor has the Lord chosen
this one."
10Jesse had seven of his sons pass
before Samuel, but Samuel said to him,
"The Lord has not chosen these."
11So he asked Jesse, "Are these all the
sons you have?" "There is still the
youngest," Jesse answered, "but he is
tending the sheep." Samuel said, "Send
for him; we will not sit down until he
arrives."
12So he sent and had him brought in. He
was ruddy, with a fine appearance and
handsome features. Then the Lord said,
"Rise and anoint him; he is the one."
13So Samuel took the horn of oil and
anointed him in the presence of his
brothers, and from that day on the Spirit
of the Lord came upon David in power.
Samuel then went to Ramah.
14Now the Spirit of the Lord had
departed from Saul, and an evil spirit
from the Lord tormented him.
15Saul's attendants said to him, "See, an
evil spirit from God is tormenting you.
16Let our lord command his servants
here to search for someone who can
play the harp. He will play when the evil
spirit from God comes upon you, and
you will feel better."
17So Saul said to his attendants, "Find
someone who plays well and bring him
to me."
18One of the servants answered, "I have
seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who
knows how to play the harp. He is a
brave man and a warrior. He speaks
well and is a fine-looking man. And the
Lord is with him."
19Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse
and said, "Send me your son David,
who is with the sheep."
20So Jesse took a donkey loaded with
bread, a skin of wine and a young goat
and sent them with his son David to
Saul.
21David came to Saul and entered his
service. Saul liked him very much, and
David became one of his armor-bearers.
22Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying,
"Allow David to remain in my service, for
I am pleased with him."
23Whenever the spirit from God came
upon Saul, David would take his harp
and play. Then relief would come to
Saul; he would feel better, and the evil
spirit would leave him.
17Now the Philistines gathered their
forces for war and assembled at Socoh
in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes
Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah.
2Saul and the Israelites assembled and
camped in the Valley of Elah and drew
up their battle line to meet the Philistines.
3The Philistines occupied one hill and
the Israelites another, with the valley
between them.
4A champion named Goliath, who was
from Gath, came out of the Philistine
camp. He was over nine feet tall.
5He had a bronze helmet on his head
and wore a coat of scale armor of
bronze weighing five thousand shekels ;
6on his legs he wore bronze greaves,
and a bronze javelin was slung on his
back.
7His spear shaft was like a weaver's rod,
and its iron point weighed six hundred
shekels. His shield bearer went ahead
of him.
8Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks
of Israel, "Why do you come out and line
up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and
are you not the servants of Saul?
Choose a man and have him come
down to me.
9If he is able to fight and kill me, we will
become your subjects; but if I overcome
him and kill him, you will become our
subjects and serve us."
10Then the Philistine said, "This day I
defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man
and let us fight each other."
11On hearing the Philistine's words, Saul
and all the Israelites were dismayed and
terrified.
12Now David was the son of an
Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from
Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight
sons, and in Saul's time he was old and
well advanced in years.
13Jesse's three oldest sons had followed
Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab;
the second, Abinadab; and the third,
Shammah.
14David was the youngest. The three
oldest followed Saul,
15but David went back and forth from
Saul to tend his father's sheep at
Bethlehem.
16For forty days the Philistine came
forward every morning and evening and
took his stand.
17Now Jesse said to his son David,
"Take this ephah of roasted grain and
these ten loaves of bread for your
brothers and hurry to their camp.
18Take along these ten cheeses to the
commander of their unit. See how your
brothers are and bring back some
assurance from them.
19They are with Saul and all the men of
Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting
against the Philistines."
20Early in the morning David left the
flock with a shepherd, loaded up and set
out, as Jesse had directed. He reached
the camp as the army was going out to
its battle positions, shouting the war cry.
21Israel and the Philistines were drawing
up their lines facing each other.
22David left his things with the keeper of
supplies, ran to the battle lines and
greeted his brothers.
23As he was talking with them, Goliath,
the Philistine champion from Gath,
stepped out from his lines and shouted
his usual defiance, and David heard it.
24When the Israelites saw the man, they
all ran from him in great fear.
25Now the Israelites had been saying,
"Do you see how this man keeps
coming out? He comes out to defy Israel.
The king will give great wealth to the
man who kills him. He will also give him
his daughter in marriage and will exempt
his father's family from taxes in Israel."
26David asked the men standing near
him, "What will be done for the man who
kills this Philistine and removes this
disgrace from Israel? Who is this
uncircumcised Philistine that he should
defy the armies of the living God?"
27They repeated to him what they had
been saying and told him, "This is what
will be done for the man who kills him."
28When Eliab, David's oldest brother,
heard him speaking with the men, he
burned with anger at him and asked,
"Why have you come down here? And
with whom did you leave those few
sheep in the desert? I know how
conceited you are and how wicked your
heart is; you came down only to watch
the battle."
29"Now what have I done?" said David.
"Can't I even speak?"
30He then turned away to someone else
and brought up the same matter, and
the men answered him as before.
31What David said was overheard and
reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him.
32David said to Saul, "Let no one lose
heart on account of this Philistine; your
servant will go and fight him."
33Saul replied, "You are not able to go
out against this Philistine and fight him;
you are only a boy, and he has been a
fighting man from his youth."
34But David said to Saul, "Your servant
has been keeping his father's sheep.
When a lion or a bear came and carried
off a sheep from the flock,
35I went after it, struck it and rescued the
sheep from its mouth. When it turned on
me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and
killed it.
36Your servant has killed both the lion
and the bear; this uncircumcised
Philistine will be like one of them,
because he has defied the armies of the
living God.
37The Lord who delivered me from the
paw of the lion and the paw of the bear
will deliver me from the hand of this
Philistine." Saul said to David, "Go, and
the Lord be with you."
38Then Saul dressed David in his own
tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and
a bronze helmet on his head.
39David fastened on his sword over the
tunic and tried walking around, because
he was not used to them. "I cannot go in
these," he said to Saul, "because I am
not used to them." So he took them off.
40Then he took his staff in his hand,
chose five smooth stones from the
stream, put them in the pouch of his
shepherd's bag and, with his sling in his
hand, approached the Philistine.
41Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his
shield bearer in front of him, kept
coming closer to David.
42He looked David over and saw that he
was only a boy, ruddy and handsome,
and he despised him.
43He said to David, "Am I a dog, that you
come at me with sticks?" And the
Philistine cursed David by his gods.
44"Come here," he said, "and I'll give
your flesh to the birds of the air and the
beasts of the field!"
45David said to the Philistine, "You come
against me with sword and spear and
javelin, but I come against you in the
name of the Lord Almighty, the God of
the armies of Israel, whom you have
defied.
46This day the Lord will hand you over to
me, and I'll strike you down and cut off
your head. Today I will give the
carcasses of the Philistine army to the
birds of the air and the beasts of the
earth, and the whole world will know that
there is a God in Israel.
47All those gathered here will know that
it is not by sword or spear that the Lord
saves; for the battle is the Lord 's, and
he will give all of you into our hands."
48As the Philistine moved closer to
attack him, David ran quickly toward the
battle line to meet him.
49Reaching into his bag and taking out a
stone, he slung it and struck the
Philistine on the forehead. The stone
sank into his forehead, and he fell
facedown on the ground.
50So David triumphed over the Philistine
with a sling and a stone; without a sword
in his hand he struck down the Philistine
and killed him.
51David ran and stood over him. He took
hold of the Philistine's sword and drew it
from the scabbard. After he killed him,
he cut off his head with the sword.
When the Philistines saw that their hero
was dead, they turned and ran.
52Then the men of Israel and Judah
surged forward with a shout and
pursued the Philistines to the entrance
of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. Their
dead were strewn along the Shaaraim
road to Gath and Ekron.
53When the Israelites returned from
chasing the Philistines, they plundered
their camp.
54David took the Philistine's head and
brought it to Jerusalem, and he put the
Philistine's weapons in his own tent.
55As Saul watched David going out to
meet the Philistine, he said to Abner,
commander of the army, "Abner, whose
son is that young man?" Abner replied,
"As surely as you live, O king, I don't
know."
56The king said, "Find out whose son
this young man is."
57As soon as David returned from killing
the Philistine, Abner took him and
brought him before Saul, with David still
holding the Philistine's head.
58"Whose son are you, young man?"
Saul asked him. David said, "I am the
son of your servant Jesse of
Bethlehem."
18After David had finished talking
with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit
with David, and he loved him as himself.
2From that day Saul kept David with him
and did not let him return to his father's
house.
3And Jonathan made a covenant with
David because he loved him as himself.
4Jonathan took off the robe he was
wearing and gave it to David, along with
his tunic, and even his sword, his bow
and his belt.
5Whatever Saul sent him to do, David
did it so successfully that Saul gave him
a high rank in the army. This pleased all
the people, and Saul's officers as well.
6When the men were returning home
after David had killed the Philistine, the
women came out from all the towns of
Israel to meet King Saul with singing
and dancing, with joyful songs and with
tambourines and lutes.
7As they danced, they sang: "Saul has
slain his thousands, and David his tens
of thousands."
8Saul was very angry; this refrain galled
him. "They have credited David with
tens of thousands," he thought, "but me
with only thousands. What more can he
get but the kingdom?"
9And from that time on Saul kept a
jealous eye on David.
10The next day an evil spirit from God
came forcefully upon Saul. He was
prophesying in his house, while David
was playing the harp, as he usually did.
Saul had a spear in his hand
11and he hurled it, saying to himself, "I'll
pin David to the wall." But David eluded
him twice.
12Saul was afraid of David, because the
Lord was with David but had left Saul.
13So he sent David away from him and
gave him command over a thousand
men, and David led the troops in their
campaigns.
14In everything he did he had great
success, because the Lord was with him.
15When Saul saw how successful he
was, he was afraid of him.
16But all Israel and Judah loved David,
because he led them in their campaigns.
17Saul said to David, "Here is my older
daughter Merab. I will give her to you in
marriage; only serve me bravely and
fight the battles of the Lord ." For Saul
said to himself, "I will not raise a hand
against him. Let the Philistines do that!"
18But David said to Saul, "Who am I, and
what is my family or my father's clan in
Israel, that I should become the king's
son-in-law?"
19So when the time came for Merab,
Saul's daughter, to be given to David,
she was given in marriage to Adriel of
Meholah.
20Now Saul's daughter Michal was in
love with David, and when they told Saul
about it, he was pleased.
21"I will give her to him," he thought, "so
that she may be a snare to him and so
that the hand of the Philistines may be
against him." So Saul said to David,
"Now you have a second opportunity to
become my son-in-law."
22Then Saul ordered his attendants:
"Speak to David privately and say, 'Look,
the king is pleased with you, and his
attendants all like you; now become his
son-in-law.' "
23They repeated these words to David.
But David said, "Do you think it is a
small matter to become the king's sonin-
law? I'm only a poor man and little
known."
24When Saul's servants told him what
David had said,
25Saul replied, "Say to David, 'The king
wants no other price for the bride than a
hundred Philistine foreskins, to take
revenge on his enemies.' " Saul's plan
was to have David fall by the hands of
the Philistines.
26When the attendants told David these
things, he was pleased to become the
king's son-in-law. So before the allotted
time elapsed,
27David and his men went out and killed
two hundred Philistines. He brought
their foreskins and presented the full
number to the king so that he might
become the king's son-in-law. Then Saul
gave him his daughter Michal in
marriage.
28When Saul realized that the Lord was
with David and that his daughter Michal
loved David,
29Saul became still more afraid of him,
and he remained his enemy the rest of
his days.
30The Philistine commanders continued
to go out to battle, and as often as they
did, David met with more success than
the rest of Saul's officers, and his name
became well known.
19Saul told his son Jonathan and all
the attendants to kill David. But
Jonathan was very fond of David
2and warned him, "My father Saul is
looking for a chance to kill you. Be on
your guard tomorrow morning; go into
hiding and stay there.
3I will go out and stand with my father in
the field where you are. I'll speak to him
about you and will tell you what I find
out."
4Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul
his father and said to him, "Let not the
king do wrong to his servant David; he
has not wronged you, and what he has
done has benefited you greatly.
5He took his life in his hands when he
killed the Philistine. The Lord won a
great victory for all Israel, and you saw it
and were glad. Why then would you do
wrong to an innocent man like David by
killing him for no reason?"
6Saul listened to Jonathan and took this
oath: "As surely as the Lord lives, David
will not be put to death."
7So Jonathan called David and told him
the whole conversation. He brought him
to Saul, and David was with Saul as
before.
8Once more war broke out, and David
went out and fought the Philistines. He
struck them with such force that they
fled before him.
9But an evil spirit from the Lord came
upon Saul as he was sitting in his house
with his spear in his hand. While David
was playing the harp,
10Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his
spear, but David eluded him as Saul
drove the spear into the wall. That night
David made good his escape.
11Saul sent men to David's house to
watch it and to kill him in the morning.
But Michal, David's wife, warned him, "If
you don't run for your life tonight,
tomorrow you'll be killed."
12So Michal let David down through a
window, and he fled and escaped.
13Then Michal took an idol and laid it on
the bed, covering it with a garment and
putting some goats' hair at the head.
14When Saul sent the men to capture
David, Michal said, "He is ill."
15Then Saul sent the men back to see
David and told them, "Bring him up to
me in his bed so that I may kill him."
16But when the men entered, there was
the idol in the bed, and at the head was
some goats' hair.
17Saul said to Michal, "Why did you
deceive me like this and send my
enemy away so that he escaped?"
Michal told him, "He said to me, 'Let me
get away. Why should I kill you?' "
18When David had fled and made his
escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah
and told him all that Saul had done to
him. Then he and Samuel went to
Naioth and stayed there.
19Word came to Saul: "David is in Naioth
at Ramah";
20so he sent men to capture him. But
when they saw a group of prophets
prophesying, with Samuel standing
there as their leader, the Spirit of God
came upon Saul's men and they also
prophesied.
21Saul was told about it, and he sent
more men, and they prophesied too.
Saul sent men a third time, and they
also prophesied.
22Finally, he himself left for Ramah and
went to the great cistern at Secu. And
he asked, "Where are Samuel and
David?" "Over in Naioth at Ramah," they
said.
23So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But
the Spirit of God came even upon him,
and he walked along prophesying until
he came to Naioth.
24He stripped off his robes and also
prophesied in Samuel's presence. He
lay that way all that day and night. This
is why people say, "Is Saul also among
the prophets?"
20Then David fled from Naioth at
Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked,
"What have I done? What is my crime?
How have I wronged your father, that he
is trying to take my life?"
2"Never!" Jonathan replied. "You are not
going to die! Look, my father doesn't do
anything, great or small, without
confiding in me. Why would he hide this
from me? It's not so!"
3But David took an oath and said, "Your
father knows very well that I have found
favor in your eyes, and he has said to
himself, 'Jonathan must not know this or
he will be grieved.' Yet as surely as the
Lord lives and as you live, there is only
a step between me and death."
4Jonathan said to David, "Whatever you
want me to do, I'll do for you."
5So David said, "Look, tomorrow is the
New Moon festival, and I am supposed
to dine with the king; but let me go and
hide in the field until the evening of the
day after tomorrow.
6If your father misses me at all, tell him,
'David earnestly asked my permission to
hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown,
because an annual sacrifice is being
made there for his whole clan.'
7If he says, 'Very well,' then your servant
is safe. But if he loses his temper, you
can be sure that he is determined to
harm me.
8As for you, show kindness to your
servant, for you have brought him into a
covenant with you before the Lord . If I
am guilty, then kill me yourself! Why
hand me over to your father?"
9"Never!" Jonathan said. "If I had the
least inkling that my father was
determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell
you?"
10David asked, "Who will tell me if your
father answers you harshly?"
11"Come," Jonathan said, "let's go out
into the field." So they went there
together.
12Then Jonathan said to David: "By the
Lord , the God of Israel, I will surely
sound out my father by this time the day
after tomorrow! If he is favorably
disposed toward you, will I not send you
word and let you know?
13But if my father is inclined to harm you,
may the Lord deal with me, be it ever so
severely, if I do not let you know and
send you away safely. May the Lord be
with you as he has been with my father.
14But show me unfailing kindness like
that of the Lord as long as I live, so that
I may not be killed,
15and do not ever cut off your kindness
from my family-not even when the Lord
has cut off every one of David's enemies
from the face of the earth."
16So Jonathan made a covenant with
the house of David, saying, "May the
Lord call David's enemies to account."
17And Jonathan had David reaffirm his
oath out of love for him, because he
loved him as he loved himself.
18Then Jonathan said to David:
"Tomorrow is the New Moon festival.
You will be missed, because your seat
will be empty.
19The day after tomorrow, toward
evening, go to the place where you hid
when this trouble began, and wait by the
stone Ezel.
20I will shoot three arrows to the side of
it, as though I were shooting at a target.
21Then I will send a boy and say, 'Go,
find the arrows.' If I say to him, 'Look,
the arrows are on this side of you; bring
them here,' then come, because, as
surely as the Lord lives, you are safe;
there is no danger.
22But if I say to the boy, 'Look, the
arrows are beyond you,' then you must
go, because the Lord has sent you away.
23And about the matter you and I
discussed-remember, the Lord is
witness between you and me forever."
24So David hid in the field, and when the
New Moon festival came, the king sat
down to eat.
25He sat in his customary place by the
wall, opposite Jonathan, and Abner sat
next to Saul, but David's place was
empty.
26Saul said nothing that day, for he
thought, "Something must have
happened to David to make him
ceremonially unclean-surely he is
unclean."
27But the next day, the second day of
the month, David's place was empty
again. Then Saul said to his son
Jonathan, "Why hasn't the son of Jesse
come to the meal, either yesterday or
today?"
28Jonathan answered, "David earnestly
asked me for permission to go to
Bethlehem.
29He said, 'Let me go, because our
family is observing a sacrifice in the
town and my brother has ordered me to
be there. If I have found favor in your
eyes, let me get away to see my
brothers.' That is why he has not come
to the king's table."
30Saul's anger flared up at Jonathan and
he said to him, "You son of a perverse
and rebellious woman! Don't I know that
you have sided with the son of Jesse to
your own shame and to the shame of
the mother who bore you?
31As long as the son of Jesse lives on
this earth, neither you nor your kingdom
will be established. Now send and bring
him to me, for he must die!"
32"Why should he be put to death? What
has he done?" Jonathan asked his
father.
33But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill
him. Then Jonathan knew that his father
intended to kill David.
34Jonathan got up from the table in
fierce anger; on that second day of the
month he did not eat, because he was
grieved at his father's shameful
treatment of David.
35In the morning Jonathan went out to
the field for his meeting with David. He
had a small boy with him,
36and he said to the boy, "Run and find
the arrows I shoot." As the boy ran, he
shot an arrow beyond him.
37When the boy came to the place
where Jonathan's arrow had fallen,
Jonathan called out after him, "Isn't the
arrow beyond you?"
38Then he shouted, "Hurry! Go quickly!
Don't stop!" The boy picked up the arrow
and returned to his master.
39(The boy knew nothing of all this; only
Jonathan and David knew.)
40Then Jonathan gave his weapons to
the boy and said, "Go, carry them back
to town."
41After the boy had gone, David got up
from the south side of the stone and
bowed down before Jonathan three
times, with his face to the ground. Then
they kissed each other and wept
together-but David wept the most.
42Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace,
for we have sworn friendship with each
other in the name of the Lord , saying,
'The Lord is witness between you and
me, and between your descendants and
my descendants forever.' " Then David
left, and Jonathan went back to the town.
21David went to Nob, to Ahimelech
the priest. Ahimelech trembled when he
met him, and asked, "Why are you
alone? Why is no one with you?"
2David answered Ahimelech the priest,
"The king charged me with a certain
matter and said to me, 'No one is to
know anything about your mission and
your instructions.' As for my men, I have
told them to meet me at a certain place.
3Now then, what do you have on hand?
Give me five loaves of bread, or
whatever you can find."
4But the priest answered David, "I don't
have any ordinary bread on hand;
however, there is some consecrated
bread here-provided the men have kept
themselves from women."
5David replied, "Indeed women have
been kept from us, as usual whenever I
set out. The men's things are holy even
on missions that are not holy. How
much more so today!"
6So the priest gave him the consecrated
bread, since there was no bread there
except the bread of the Presence that
had been removed from before the Lord
and replaced by hot bread on the day it
was taken away.
7Now one of Saul's servants was there
that day, detained before the Lord ; he
was Doeg the Edomite, Saul's head
shepherd.
8David asked Ahimelech, "Don't you
have a spear or a sword here? I haven't
brought my sword or any other weapon,
because the king's business was
urgent."
9The priest replied, "The sword of
Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in
the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped
in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want
it, take it; there is no sword here but that
one." David said, "There is none like it;
give it to me."
10That day David fled from Saul and
went to Achish king of Gath.
11But the servants of Achish said to him,
"Isn't this David, the king of the land?
Isn't he the one they sing about in their
dances: " 'Saul has slain his thousands,
and David his tens of thousands'?"
12David took these words to heart and
was very much afraid of Achish king of
Gath.
13So he pretended to be insane in their
presence; and while he was in their
hands he acted like a madman, making
marks on the doors of the gate and
letting saliva run down his beard.
14Achish said to his servants, "Look at
the man! He is insane! Why bring him to
me?
15Am I so short of madmen that you
have to bring this fellow here to carry on
like this in front of me? Must this man
come into my house?"
22David left Gath and escaped to
the cave of Adullam. When his brothers
and his father's household heard about
it, they went down to him there.
2All those who were in distress or in debt
or discontented gathered around him,
and he became their leader. About four
hundred men were with him.
3From there David went to Mizpah in
Moab and said to the king of Moab,
"Would you let my father and mother
come and stay with you until I learn
what God will do for me?"
4So he left them with the king of Moab,
and they stayed with him as long as
David was in the stronghold.
5But the prophet Gad said to David, "Do
not stay in the stronghold. Go into the
land of Judah." So David left and went
to the forest of Hereth.
6Now Saul heard that David and his men
had been discovered. And Saul, spear
in hand, was seated under the tamarisk
tree on the hill at Gibeah, with all his
officials standing around him.
7Saul said to them, "Listen, men of
Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all
of you fields and vineyards? Will he
make all of you commanders of
thousands and commanders of
hundreds?
8Is that why you have all conspired
against me? No one tells me when my
son makes a covenant with the son of
Jesse. None of you is concerned about
me or tells me that my son has incited
my servant to lie in wait for me, as he
does today."
9But Doeg the Edomite, who was
standing with Saul's officials, said, "I
saw the son of Jesse come to
Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob.
10Ahimelech inquired of the Lord for him;
he also gave him provisions and the
sword of Goliath the Philistine."
11Then the king sent for the priest
Ahimelech son of Ahitub and his father's
whole family, who were the priests at
Nob, and they all came to the king.
12Saul said, "Listen now, son of Ahitub."
"Yes, my lord," he answered.
13Saul said to him, "Why have you
conspired against me, you and the son
of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword
and inquiring of God for him, so that he
has rebelled against me and lies in wait
for me, as he does today?"
14Ahimelech answered the king, "Who of
all your servants is as loyal as David,
the king's son-in-law, captain of your
bodyguard and highly respected in your
household?
15Was that day the first time I inquired of
God for him? Of course not! Let not the
king accuse your servant or any of his
father's family, for your servant knows
nothing at all about this whole affair."
16But the king said, "You will surely die,
Ahimelech, you and your father's whole
family."
17Then the king ordered the guards at
his side: "Turn and kill the priests of the
Lord , because they too have sided with
David. They knew he was fleeing, yet
they did not tell me." But the king's
officials were not willing to raise a hand
to strike the priests of the Lord .
18The king then ordered Doeg, "You turn
and strike down the priests." So Doeg
the Edomite turned and struck them
down. That day he killed eighty-five men
who wore the linen ephod.
19He also put to the sword Nob, the town
of the priests, with its men and women,
its children and infants, and its cattle,
donkeys and sheep.
20But Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech son
of Ahitub, escaped and fled to join David.
21He told David that Saul had killed the
priests of the Lord .
22Then David said to Abiathar: "That day,
when Doeg the Edomite was there, I
knew he would be sure to tell Saul. I am
responsible for the death of your father's
whole family.
23Stay with me; don't be afraid; the man
who is seeking your life is seeking mine
also. You will be safe with me."
23When David was told, "Look, the
Philistines are fighting against Keilah
and are looting the threshing floors,"
2he inquired of the Lord , saying, "Shall I
go and attack these Philistines?" The
Lord answered him, "Go, attack the
Philistines and save Keilah."
3But David's men said to him, "Here in
Judah we are afraid. How much more,
then, if we go to Keilah against the
Philistine forces!"
4Once again David inquired of the Lord ,
and the Lord answered him, "Go down
to Keilah, for I am going to give the
Philistines into your hand."
5So David and his men went to Keilah,
fought the Philistines and carried off
their livestock. He inflicted heavy losses
on the Philistines and saved the people
of Keilah.
6(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelech had
brought the ephod down with him when
he fled to David at Keilah.)
7Saul was told that David had gone to
Keilah, and he said, "God has handed
him over to me, for David has
imprisoned himself by entering a town
with gates and bars."
8And Saul called up all his forces for
battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege
David and his men.
9When David learned that Saul was
plotting against him, he said to Abiathar
the priest, "Bring the ephod."
10David said, "O Lord , God of Israel,
your servant has heard definitely that
Saul plans to come to Keilah and
destroy the town on account of me.
11Will the citizens of Keilah surrender
me to him? Will Saul come down, as
your servant has heard? O Lord , God of
Israel, tell your servant." And the Lord
said, "He will."
12Again David asked, "Will the citizens of
Keilah surrender me and my men to
Saul?" And the Lord said, "They will."
13So David and his men, about six
hundred in number, left Keilah and kept
moving from place to place. When Saul
was told that David had escaped from
Keilah, he did not go there.
14David stayed in the desert strongholds
and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph.
Day after day Saul searched for him, but
God did not give David into his hands.
15While David was at Horesh in the
Desert of Ziph, he learned that Saul had
come out to take his life.
16And Saul's son Jonathan went to
David at Horesh and helped him find
strength in God.
17"Don't be afraid," he said. "My father
Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will
be king over Israel, and I will be second
to you. Even my father Saul knows this."
18The two of them made a covenant
before the Lord . Then Jonathan went
home, but David remained at Horesh.
19The Ziphites went up to Saul at
Gibeah and said, "Is not David hiding
among us in the strongholds at Horesh,
on the hill of Hakilah, south of
Jeshimon?
20Now, O king, come down whenever it
pleases you to do so, and we will be
responsible for handing him over to the
king."
21Saul replied, "The Lord bless you for
your concern for me.
22Go and make further preparation. Find
out where David usually goes and who
has seen him there. They tell me he is
very crafty.
23Find out about all the hiding places he
uses and come back to me with definite
information. Then I will go with you; if he
is in the area, I will track him down
among all the clans of Judah."
24So they set out and went to Ziph
ahead of Saul. Now David and his men
were in the Desert of Maon, in the
Arabah south of Jeshimon.
25Saul and his men began the search,
and when David was told about it, he
went down to the rock and stayed in the
Desert of Maon. When Saul heard this,
he went into the Desert of Maon in
pursuit of David.
26Saul was going along one side of the
mountain, and David and his men were
on the other side, hurrying to get away
from Saul. As Saul and his forces were
closing in on David and his men to
capture them,
27a messenger came to Saul, saying,
"Come quickly! The Philistines are
raiding the land."
28Then Saul broke off his pursuit of
David and went to meet the Philistines.
That is why they call this place Sela
Hammahlekoth.
29And David went up from there and
lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.
24After Saul returned from pursuing
the Philistines, he was told, "David is in
the Desert of En Gedi."
2So Saul took three thousand chosen
men from all Israel and set out to look
for David and his men near the Crags of
the Wild Goats.
3He came to the sheep pens along the
way; a cave was there, and Saul went in
to relieve himself. David and his men
were far back in the cave.
4The men said, "This is the day the Lord
spoke of when he said to you, 'I will give
your enemy into your hands for you to
deal with as you wish.' " Then David
crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner
of Saul's robe.
5Afterward, David was consciencestricken
for having cut off a corner of his
robe.
6He said to his men, "The Lord forbid
that I should do such a thing to my
master, the Lord 's anointed, or lift my
hand against him; for he is the anointed
of the Lord ."
7With these words David rebuked his
men and did not allow them to attack
Saul. And Saul left the cave and went
his way.
8Then David went out of the cave and
called out to Saul, "My lord the king!"
When Saul looked behind him, David
bowed down and prostrated himself with
his face to the ground.
9He said to Saul, "Why do you listen
when men say, 'David is bent on
harming you'?
10This day you have seen with your own
eyes how the Lord delivered you into my
hands in the cave. Some urged me to
kill you, but I spared you; I said, 'I will
not lift my hand against my master,
because he is the Lord 's anointed.'
11See, my father, look at this piece of
your robe in my hand! I cut off the
corner of your robe but did not kill you.
Now understand and recognize that I
am not guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion.
I have not wronged you, but you are
hunting me down to take my life.
12May the Lord judge between you and
me. And may the Lord avenge the
wrongs you have done to me, but my
hand will not touch you.
13As the old saying goes, 'From
evildoers come evil deeds,' so my hand
will not touch you.
14"Against whom has the king of Israel
come out? Whom are you pursuing? A
dead dog? A flea?
15May the Lord be our judge and decide
between us. May he consider my cause
and uphold it; may he vindicate me by
delivering me from your hand."
16When David finished saying this, Saul
asked, "Is that your voice, David my
son?" And he wept aloud.
17"You are more righteous than I," he
said. "You have treated me well, but I
have treated you badly.
18You have just now told me of the good
you did to me; the Lord delivered me
into your hands, but you did not kill me.
19When a man finds his enemy, does he
let him get away unharmed? May the
Lord reward you well for the way you
treated me today.
20I know that you will surely be king and
that the kingdom of Israel will be
established in your hands.
21Now swear to me by the Lord that you
will not cut off my descendants or wipe
out my name from my father's family."
22So David gave his oath to Saul. Then
Saul returned home, but David and his
men went up to the stronghold.
25Now Samuel died, and all Israel
assembled and mourned for him; and
they buried him at his home in Ramah.
Then David moved down into the Desert
of Maon.
2A certain man in Maon, who had
property there at Carmel, was very
wealthy. He had a thousand goats and
three thousand sheep, which he was
shearing in Carmel.
3His name was Nabal and his wife's
name was Abigail. She was an
intelligent and beautiful woman, but her
husband, a Calebite, was surly and
mean in his dealings.
4While David was in the desert, he
heard that Nabal was shearing sheep.
5So he sent ten young men and said to
them, "Go up to Nabal at Carmel and
greet him in my name.
6Say to him: 'Long life to you! Good
health to you and your household! And
good health to all that is yours!
7" 'Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing
time. When your shepherds were with
us, we did not mistreat them, and the
whole time they were at Carmel nothing
of theirs was missing.
8Ask your own servants and they will tell
you. Therefore be favorable toward my
young men, since we come at a festive
time. Please give your servants and
your son David whatever you can find
for them.' "
9When David's men arrived, they gave
Nabal this message in David's name.
Then they waited.
10Nabal answered David's servants,
"Who is this David? Who is this son of
Jesse? Many servants are breaking
away from their masters these days.
11Why should I take my bread and water,
and the meat I have slaughtered for my
shearers, and give it to men coming
from who knows where?"
12David's men turned around and went
back. When they arrived, they reported
every word.
13David said to his men, "Put on your
swords!" So they put on their swords,
and David put on his. About four
hundred men went up with David, while
two hundred stayed with the supplies.
14One of the servants told Nabal's wife
Abigail: "David sent messengers from
the desert to give our master his
greetings, but he hurled insults at them.
15Yet these men were very good to us.
They did not mistreat us, and the whole
time we were out in the fields near them
nothing was missing.
16Night and day they were a wall around
us all the time we were herding our
sheep near them.
17Now think it over and see what you
can do, because disaster is hanging
over our master and his whole
household. He is such a wicked man
that no one can talk to him."
18Abigail lost no time. She took two
hundred loaves of bread, two skins of
wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs of
roasted grain, a hundred cakes of
raisins and two hundred cakes of
pressed figs, and loaded them on
donkeys.
19Then she told her servants, "Go on
ahead; I'll follow you." But she did not
tell her husband Nabal.
20As she came riding her donkey into a
mountain ravine, there were David and
his men descending toward her, and
she met them.
21David had just said, "It's been uselessall
my watching over this fellow's
property in the desert so that nothing of
his was missing. He has paid me back
evil for good.
22May God deal with David, be it ever so
severely, if by morning I leave alive one
male of all who belong to him!"
23When Abigail saw David, she quickly
got off her donkey and bowed down
before David with her face to the ground.
24She fell at his feet and said: "My lord,
let the blame be on me alone. Please let
your servant speak to you; hear what
your servant has to say.
25May my lord pay no attention to that
wicked man Nabal. He is just like his
name-his name is Fool, and folly goes
with him. But as for me, your servant, I
did not see the men my master sent.
26"Now since the Lord has kept you, my
master, from bloodshed and from
avenging yourself with your own hands,
as surely as the Lord lives and as you
live, may your enemies and all who
intend to harm my master be like Nabal.
27And let this gift, which your servant
has brought to my master, be given to
the men who follow you.
28Please forgive your servant's offense,
for the Lord will certainly make a lasting
dynasty for my master, because he
fights the Lord 's battles. Let no
wrongdoing be found in you as long as
you live.
29Even though someone is pursuing you
to take your life, the life of my master
will be bound securely in the bundle of
the living by the Lord your God. But the
lives of your enemies he will hurl away
as from the pocket of a sling.
30When the Lord has done for my
master every good thing he promised
concerning him and has appointed him
leader over Israel,
31my master will not have on his
conscience the staggering burden of
needless bloodshed or of having
avenged himself. And when the Lord
has brought my master success,
remember your servant."
32David said to Abigail, "Praise be to the
Lord , the God of Israel, who has sent
you today to meet me.
33May you be blessed for your good
judgment and for keeping me from
bloodshed this day and from avenging
myself with my own hands.
34Otherwise, as surely as the Lord , the
God of Israel, lives, who has kept me
from harming you, if you had not come
quickly to meet me, not one male
belonging to Nabal would have been left
alive by daybreak."
35Then David accepted from her hand
what she had brought him and said, "Go
home in peace. I have heard your words
and granted your request."
36When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in
the house holding a banquet like that of
a king. He was in high spirits and very
drunk. So she told him nothing until
daybreak.
37Then in the morning, when Nabal was
sober, his wife told him all these things,
and his heart failed him and he became
like a stone.
38About ten days later, the Lord struck
Nabal and he died.
39When David heard that Nabal was
dead, he said, "Praise be to the Lord ,
who has upheld my cause against Nabal
for treating me with contempt. He has
kept his servant from doing wrong and
has brought Nabal's wrongdoing down
on his own head." Then David sent word
to Abigail, asking her to become his wife.
40His servants went to Carmel and said
to Abigail, "David has sent us to you to
take you to become his wife."
41She bowed down with her face to the
ground and said, "Here is your
maidservant, ready to serve you and
wash the feet of my master's servants."
42Abigail quickly got on a donkey and,
attended by her five maids, went with
David's messengers and became his
wife.
43David had also married Ahinoam of
Jezreel, and they both were his wives.
44But Saul had given his daughter
Michal, David's wife, to Paltiel son of
Laish, who was from Gallim.
26The Ziphites went to Saul at
Gibeah and said, "Is not David hiding on
the hill of Hakilah, which faces
Jeshimon?"
2So Saul went down to the Desert of
Ziph, with his three thousand chosen
men of Israel, to search there for David.
3Saul made his camp beside the road on
the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon, but
David stayed in the desert. When he
saw that Saul had followed him there,
4he sent out scouts and learned that
Saul had definitely arrived.
5Then David set out and went to the
place where Saul had camped. He saw
where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the
commander of the army, had lain down.
Saul was lying inside the camp, with the
army encamped around him.
6David then asked Ahimelech the Hittite
and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab's
brother, "Who will go down into the
camp with me to Saul?" "I'll go with you,"
said Abishai.
7So David and Abishai went to the army
by night, and there was Saul, lying
asleep inside the camp with his spear
stuck in the ground near his head.
Abner and the soldiers were lying
around him.
8Abishai said to David, "Today God has
delivered your enemy into your hands.
Now let me pin him to the ground with
one thrust of my spear; I won't strike him
twice."
9But David said to Abishai, "Don't
destroy him! Who can lay a hand on the
Lord 's anointed and be guiltless?
10As surely as the Lord lives," he said,
"the Lord himself will strike him; either
his time will come and he will die, or he
will go into battle and perish.
11But the Lord forbid that I should lay a
hand on the Lord 's anointed. Now get
the spear and water jug that are near his
head, and let's go."
12So David took the spear and water jug
near Saul's head, and they left. No one
saw or knew about it, nor did anyone
wake up. They were all sleeping,
because the Lord had put them into a
deep sleep.
13Then David crossed over to the other
side and stood on top of the hill some
distance away; there was a wide space
between them.
14He called out to the army and to Abner
son of Ner, "Aren't you going to answer
me, Abner?" Abner replied, "Who are
you who calls to the king?"
15David said, "You're a man, aren't you?
And who is like you in Israel? Why didn't
you guard your lord the king? Someone
came to destroy your lord the king.
16What you have done is not good. As
surely as the Lord lives, you and your
men deserve to die, because you did
not guard your master, the Lord 's
anointed. Look around you. Where are
the king's spear and water jug that were
near his head?"
17Saul recognized David's voice and
said, "Is that your voice, David my son?"
David replied, "Yes it is, my lord the
king."
18And he added, "Why is my lord
pursuing his servant? What have I done,
and what wrong am I guilty of?
19Now let my lord the king listen to his
servant's words. If the Lord has incited
you against me, then may he accept an
offering. If, however, men have done it,
may they be cursed before the Lord !
They have now driven me from my
share in the Lord 's inheritance and
have said, 'Go, serve other gods.'
20Now do not let my blood fall to the
ground far from the presence of the
Lord . The king of Israel has come out to
look for a flea-as one hunts a partridge
in the mountains."
21Then Saul said, "I have sinned. Come
back, David my son. Because you
considered my life precious today, I will
not try to harm you again. Surely I have
acted like a fool and have erred greatly."
22"Here is the king's spear," David
answered. "Let one of your young men
come over and get it.
23The Lord rewards every man for his
righteousness and faithfulness. The
Lord delivered you into my hands today,
but I would not lay a hand on the Lord 's
anointed.
24As surely as I valued your life today,
so may the Lord value my life and
deliver me from all trouble."
25Then Saul said to David, "May you be
blessed, my son David; you will do great
things and surely triumph." So David
went on his way, and Saul returned
home.
27But David thought to himself, "One
of these days I will be destroyed by the
hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is
to escape to the land of the Philistines.
Then Saul will give up searching for me
anywhere in Israel, and I will slip out of
his hand."
2So David and the six hundred men with
him left and went over to Achish son of
Maoch king of Gath.
3David and his men settled in Gath with
Achish. Each man had his family with
him, and David had his two wives:
Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of
Carmel, the widow of Nabal.
4When Saul was told that David had fled
to Gath, he no longer searched for him.
5Then David said to Achish, "If I have
found favor in your eyes, let a place be
assigned to me in one of the country
towns, that I may live there. Why should
your servant live in the royal city with
you?"
6So on that day Achish gave him Ziklag,
and it has belonged to the kings of
Judah ever since.
7David lived in Philistine territory a year
and four months.
8Now David and his men went up and
raided the Geshurites, the Girzites and
the Amalekites. (From ancient times
these peoples had lived in the land
extending to Shur and Egypt.)
9Whenever David attacked an area, he
did not leave a man or woman alive, but
took sheep and cattle, donkeys and
camels, and clothes. Then he returned
to Achish.
10When Achish asked, "Where did you
go raiding today?" David would say,
"Against the Negev of Judah" or
"Against the Negev of Jerahmeel" or
"Against the Negev of the Kenites."
11He did not leave a man or woman
alive to be brought to Gath, for he
thought, "They might inform on us and
say, 'This is what David did.' " And such
was his practice as long as he lived in
Philistine territory.
12Achish trusted David and said to
himself, "He has become so odious to
his people, the Israelites, that he will be
my servant forever."
28In those days the Philistines
gathered their forces to fight against
Israel. Achish said to David, "You must
understand that you and your men will
accompany me in the army."
2David said, "Then you will see for
yourself what your servant can do."
Achish replied, "Very well, I will make
you my bodyguard for life."
3Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel
had mourned for him and buried him in
his own town of Ramah. Saul had
expelled the mediums and spiritists from
the land.
4The Philistines assembled and came
and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul
gathered all the Israelites and set up
camp at Gilboa.
5When Saul saw the Philistine army, he
was afraid; terror filled his heart.
6He inquired of the Lord , but the Lord
did not answer him by dreams or Urim
or prophets.
7Saul then said to his attendants, "Find
me a woman who is a medium, so I may
go and inquire of her." "There is one in
Endor," they said.
8So Saul disguised himself, putting on
other clothes, and at night he and two
men went to the woman. "Consult a
spirit for me," he said, "and bring up for
me the one I name."
9But the woman said to him, "Surely you
know what Saul has done. He has cut
off the mediums and spiritists from the
land. Why have you set a trap for my life
to bring about my death?"
10Saul swore to her by the Lord , "As
surely as the Lord lives, you will not be
punished for this."
11Then the woman asked, "Whom shall I
bring up for you?" "Bring up Samuel," he
said.
12When the woman saw Samuel, she
cried out at the top of her voice and said
to Saul, "Why have you deceived me?
You are Saul!"
13The king said to her, "Don't be afraid.
What do you see?" The woman said, "I
see a spirit coming up out of the
ground."
14"What does he look like?" he asked.
"An old man wearing a robe is coming
up," she said. Then Saul knew it was
Samuel, and he bowed down and
prostrated himself with his face to the
ground.
15Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you
disturbed me by bringing me up?" "I am
in great distress," Saul said. "The
Philistines are fighting against me, and
God has turned away from me. He no
longer answers me, either by prophets
or by dreams. So I have called on you to
tell me what to do."
16Samuel said, "Why do you consult me,
now that the Lord has turned away from
you and become your enemy?
17The Lord has done what he predicted
through me. The Lord has torn the
kingdom out of your hands and given it
to one of your neighbors-to David.
18Because you did not obey the Lord or
carry out his fierce wrath against the
Amalekites, the Lord has done this to
you today.
19The Lord will hand over both Israel
and you to the Philistines, and tomorrow
you and your sons will be with me. The
Lord will also hand over the army of
Israel to the Philistines."
20Immediately Saul fell full length on the
ground, filled with fear because of
Samuel's words. His strength was gone,
for he had eaten nothing all that day and
night.
21When the woman came to Saul and
saw that he was greatly shaken, she
said, "Look, your maidservant has
obeyed you. I took my life in my hands
and did what you told me to do.
22Now please listen to your servant and
let me give you some food so you may
eat and have the strength to go on your
way."
23He refused and said, "I will not eat."
But his men joined the woman in urging
him, and he listened to them. He got up
from the ground and sat on the couch.
24The woman had a fattened calf at the
house, which she butchered at once.
She took some flour, kneaded it and
baked bread without yeast.
25Then she set it before Saul and his
men, and they ate. That same night they
got up and left.
29The Philistines gathered all their
forces at Aphek, and Israel camped by
the spring in Jezreel.
2As the Philistine rulers marched with
their units of hundreds and thousands,
David and his men were marching at the
rear with Achish.
3The commanders of the Philistines
asked, "What about these Hebrews?"
Achish replied, "Is this not David, who
was an officer of Saul king of Israel? He
has already been with me for over a
year, and from the day he left Saul until
now, I have found no fault in him."
4But the Philistine commanders were
angry with him and said, "Send the man
back, that he may return to the place
you assigned him. He must not go with
us into battle, or he will turn against us
during the fighting. How better could he
regain his master's favor than by taking
the heads of our own men?
5Isn't this the David they sang about in
their dances: " 'Saul has slain his
thousands, and David his tens of
thousands'?"
6So Achish called David and said to him,
"As surely as the Lord lives, you have
been reliable, and I would be pleased to
have you serve with me in the army.
From the day you came to me until now,
I have found no fault in you, but the
rulers don't approve of you.
7Turn back and go in peace; do nothing
to displease the Philistine rulers."
8"But what have I done?" asked David.
"What have you found against your
servant from the day I came to you until
now? Why can't I go and fight against
the enemies of my lord the king?"
9Achish answered, "I know that you
have been as pleasing in my eyes as an
angel of God; nevertheless, the
Philistine commanders have said, 'He
must not go up with us into battle.'
10Now get up early, along with your
master's servants who have come with
you, and leave in the morning as soon
as it is light."
11So David and his men got up early in
the morning to go back to the land of the
Philistines, and the Philistines went up
to Jezreel.
30David and his men reached Ziklag
on the third day. Now the Amalekites
had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They
had attacked Ziklag and burned it,
2and had taken captive the women and
all who were in it, both young and old.
They killed none of them, but carried
them off as they went on their way.
3When David and his men came to
Ziklag, they found it destroyed by fire
and their wives and sons and daughters
taken captive.
4So David and his men wept aloud until
they had no strength left to weep.
5David's two wives had been captured-
Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the
widow of Nabal of Carmel.
6David was greatly distressed because
the men were talking of stoning him;
each one was bitter in spirit because of
his sons and daughters. But David
found strength in the Lord his God.
7Then David said to Abiathar the priest,
the son of Ahimelech, "Bring me the
ephod." Abiathar brought it to him,
8and David inquired of the Lord , "Shall I
pursue this raiding party? Will I overtake
them?" "Pursue them," he answered.
"You will certainly overtake them and
succeed in the rescue."
9David and the six hundred men with
him came to the Besor Ravine, where
some stayed behind,
10for two hundred men were too
exhausted to cross the ravine. But David
and four hundred men continued the
pursuit.
11They found an Egyptian in a field and
brought him to David. They gave him
water to drink and food to eat-
12part of a cake of pressed figs and two
cakes of raisins. He ate and was revived,
for he had not eaten any food or drunk
any water for three days and three
nights.
13David asked him, "To whom do you
belong, and where do you come from?"
He said, "I am an Egyptian, the slave of
an Amalekite. My master abandoned me
when I became ill three days ago.
14We raided the Negev of the Kerethites
and the territory belonging to Judah and
the Negev of Caleb. And we burned
Ziklag."
15David asked him, "Can you lead me
down to this raiding party?" He
answered, "Swear to me before God
that you will not kill me or hand me over
to my master, and I will take you down
to them."
16He led David down, and there they
were, scattered over the countryside,
eating, drinking and reveling because of
the great amount of plunder they had
taken from the land of the Philistines
and from Judah.
17David fought them from dusk until the
evening of the next day, and none of
them got away, except four hundred
young men who rode off on camels and
fled.
18David recovered everything the
Amalekites had taken, including his two
wives.
19Nothing was missing: young or old,
boy or girl, plunder or anything else they
had taken. David brought everything
back.
20He took all the flocks and herds, and
his men drove them ahead of the other
livestock, saying, "This is David's
plunder."
21Then David came to the two hundred
men who had been too exhausted to
follow him and who were left behind at
the Besor Ravine. They came out to
meet David and the people with him. As
David and his men approached, he
greeted them.
22But all the evil men and troublemakers
among David's followers said, "Because
they did not go out with us, we will not
share with them the plunder we
recovered. However, each man may
take his wife and children and go."
23David replied, "No, my brothers, you
must not do that with what the Lord has
given us. He has protected us and
handed over to us the forces that came
against us.
24Who will listen to what you say? The
share of the man who stayed with the
supplies is to be the same as that of him
who went down to the battle. All will
share alike."
25David made this a statute and
ordinance for Israel from that day to this.
26When David arrived in Ziklag, he sent
some of the plunder to the elders of
Judah, who were his friends, saying,
"Here is a present for you from the
plunder of the Lord 's enemies."
27He sent it to those who were in Bethel,
Ramoth Negev and Jattir;
28to those in Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa
29and Racal; to those in the towns of the
Jerahmeelites and the Kenites;
30to those in Hormah, Bor Ashan,
Athach
31and Hebron; and to those in all the
other places where David and his men
had roamed.
31Now the Philistines fought against
Israel; the Israelites fled before them,
and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
2The Philistines pressed hard after Saul
and his sons, and they killed his sons
Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua.
3The fighting grew fierce around Saul,
and when the archers overtook him,
they wounded him critically.
4Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw
your sword and run me through, or
these uncircumcised fellows will come
and run me through and abuse me." But
his armor-bearer was terrified and would
not do it; so Saul took his own sword
and fell on it.
5When the armor-bearer saw that Saul
was dead, he too fell on his sword and
died with him.
6So Saul and his three sons and his
armor-bearer and all his men died
together that same day.
7When the Israelites along the valley
and those across the Jordan saw that
the Israelite army had fled and that Saul
and his sons had died, they abandoned
their towns and fled. And the Philistines
came and occupied them.
8The next day, when the Philistines
came to strip the dead, they found Saul
and his three sons fallen on Mount
Gilboa.
9They cut off his head and stripped off
his armor, and they sent messengers
throughout the land of the Philistines to
proclaim the news in the temple of their
idols and among their people.
10They put his armor in the temple of the
Ashtoreths and fastened his body to the
wall of Beth Shan.
11When the people of Jabesh Gilead
heard of what the Philistines had done
to Saul,
12all their valiant men journeyed through
the night to Beth Shan. They took down
the bodies of Saul and his sons from the
wall of Beth Shan and went to Jabesh,
where they burned them.
13Then they took their bones and buried
them under a tamarisk tree at Jabesh,
and they fasted seven days.
2nd Samuel
1After the death of Saul, David
returned from defeating the Amalekites
and stayed in Ziklag two days.
2On the third day a man arrived from
Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and
with dust on his head. When he came to
David, he fell to the ground to pay him
honor.
3"Where have you come from?" David
asked him. He answered, "I have
escaped from the Israelite camp."
4"What happened?" David asked. "Tell
me." He said, "The men fled from the
battle. Many of them fell and died. And
Saul and his son Jonathan are dead."
5Then David said to the young man who
brought him the report, "How do you
know that Saul and his son Jonathan
are dead?"
6"I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,"
the young man said, "and there was
Saul, leaning on his spear, with the
chariots and riders almost upon him.
7When he turned around and saw me,
he called out to me, and I said, 'What
can I do?'
8"He asked me, 'Who are you?' " 'An
Amalekite,' I answered.
9"Then he said to me, 'Stand over me
and kill me! I am in the throes of death,
but I'm still alive.'
10"So I stood over him and killed him,
because I knew that after he had fallen
he could not survive. And I took the
crown that was on his head and the
band on his arm and have brought them
here to my lord."
11Then David and all the men with him
took hold of their clothes and tore them.
12They mourned and wept and fasted till
evening for Saul and his son Jonathan,
and for the army of the Lord and the
house of Israel, because they had fallen
by the sword.
13David said to the young man who
brought him the report, "Where are you
from?" "I am the son of an alien, an
Amalekite," he answered.
14David asked him, "Why were you not
afraid to lift your hand to destroy the
Lord 's anointed?"
15Then David called one of his men and
said, "Go, strike him down!" So he
struck him down, and he died.
16For David had said to him, "Your blood
be on your own head. Your own mouth
testified against you when you said, 'I
killed the Lord 's anointed.' "
17David took up this lament concerning
Saul and his son Jonathan,
18and ordered that the men of Judah be
taught this lament of the bow (it is
written in the Book of Jashar):
19"Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your
heights. How the mighty have fallen!
20"Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in
the streets of Ashkelon, lest the
daughters of the Philistines be glad, lest
the daughters of the uncircumcised
rejoice.
21"O mountains of Gilboa, may you have
neither dew nor rain, nor fields that yield
offerings of grain . For there the shield
of the mighty was defiled, the shield of
Saul-no longer rubbed with oil.
22From the blood of the slain, from the
flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan
did not turn back, the sword of Saul did
not return unsatisfied.
23"Saul and Jonathan- in life they were
loved and gracious, and in death they
were not parted. They were swifter than
eagles, they were stronger than lions.
24"O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul,
who clothed you in scarlet and finery,
who adorned your garments with
ornaments of gold.
25"How the mighty have fallen in battle!
Jonathan lies slain on your heights.
26I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother;
you were very dear to me. Your love for
me was wonderful, more wonderful than
that of women.
27"How the mighty have fallen! The
weapons of war have perished!"
2In the course of time, David inquired
of the Lord . "Shall I go up to one of the
towns of Judah?" he asked. The Lord
said, "Go up." David asked, "Where
shall I go?" "To Hebron," the Lord
answered.
2So David went up there with his two
wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail,
the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
3David also took the men who were with
him, each with his family, and they
settled in Hebron and its towns.
4Then the men of Judah came to
Hebron and there they anointed David
king over the house of Judah. When
David was told that it was the men of
Jabesh Gilead who had buried Saul,
5he sent messengers to the men of
Jabesh Gilead to say to them, "The Lord
bless you for showing this kindness to
Saul your master by burying him.
6May the Lord now show you kindness
and faithfulness, and I too will show you
the same favor because you have done
this.
7Now then, be strong and brave, for
Saul your master is dead, and the house
of Judah has anointed me king over
them."
8Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the
commander of Saul's army, had taken
Ish-Bosheth son of Saul and brought
him over to Mahanaim.
9He made him king over Gilead, Ashuri
and Jezreel, and also over Ephraim,
Benjamin and all Israel.
10Ish-Bosheth son of Saul was forty
years old when he became king over
Israel, and he reigned two years. The
house of Judah, however, followed
David.
11The length of time David was king in
Hebron over the house of Judah was
seven years and six months.
12Abner son of Ner, together with the
men of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, left
Mahanaim and went to Gibeon.
13Joab son of Zeruiah and David's men
went out and met them at the pool of
Gibeon. One group sat down on one
side of the pool and one group on the
other side.
14Then Abner said to Joab, "Let's have
some of the young men get up and fight
hand to hand in front of us." "All right, let
them do it," Joab said.
15So they stood up and were counted
off-twelve men for Benjamin and Ish-
Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for
David.
16Then each man grabbed his opponent
by the head and thrust his dagger into
his opponent's side, and they fell down
together. So that place in Gibeon was
called Helkath Hazzurim.
17The battle that day was very fierce,
and Abner and the men of Israel were
defeated by David's men.
18The three sons of Zeruiah were there:
Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel
was as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle.
19He chased Abner, turning neither to
the right nor to the left as he pursued
him.
20Abner looked behind him and asked,
"Is that you, Asahel?" "It is," he
answered.
21Then Abner said to him, "Turn aside to
the right or to the left; take on one of the
young men and strip him of his
weapons." But Asahel would not stop
chasing him.
22Again Abner warned Asahel, "Stop
chasing me! Why should I strike you
down? How could I look your brother
Joab in the face?"
23But Asahel refused to give up the
pursuit; so Abner thrust the butt of his
spear into Asahel's stomach, and the
spear came out through his back. He fell
there and died on the spot. And every
man stopped when he came to the
place where Asahel had fallen and died.
24But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner,
and as the sun was setting, they came
to the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the
way to the wasteland of Gibeon.
25Then the men of Benjamin rallied
behind Abner. They formed themselves
into a group and took their stand on top
of a hill.
26Abner called out to Joab, "Must the
sword devour forever? Don't you realize
that this will end in bitterness? How long
before you order your men to stop
pursuing their brothers?"
27Joab answered, "As surely as God
lives, if you had not spoken, the men
would have continued the pursuit of their
brothers until morning. "
28So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the
men came to a halt; they no longer
pursued Israel, nor did they fight
anymore.
29All that night Abner and his men
marched through the Arabah. They
crossed the Jordan, continued through
the whole Bithron and came to
Mahanaim.
30Then Joab returned from pursuing
Abner and assembled all his men.
Besides Asahel, nineteen of David's
men were found missing.
31But David's men had killed three
hundred and sixty Benjamites who were
with Abner.
32They took Asahel and buried him in his
father's tomb at Bethlehem. Then Joab
and his men marched all night and
arrived at Hebron by daybreak.
3The war between the house of Saul
and the house of David lasted a long
time. David grew stronger and stronger,
while the house of Saul grew weaker
and weaker.
2Sons were born to David in Hebron: His
firstborn was Amnon the son of
Ahinoam of Jezreel;
3his second, Kileab the son of Abigail
the widow of Nabal of Carmel; the third,
Absalom the son of Maacah daughter of
Talmai king of Geshur;
4the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith;
the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
5and the sixth, Ithream the son of
David's wife Eglah. These were born to
David in Hebron.
6During the war between the house of
Saul and the house of David, Abner had
been strengthening his own position in
the house of Saul.
7Now Saul had had a concubine named
Rizpah daughter of Aiah. And Ish-
Bosheth said to Abner, "Why did you
sleep with my father's concubine?"
8Abner was very angry because of what
Ish-Bosheth said and he answered, "Am
I a dog's head-on Judah's side? This
very day I am loyal to the house of your
father Saul and to his family and friends.
I haven't handed you over to David. Yet
now you accuse me of an offense
involving this woman!
9May God deal with Abner, be it ever so
severely, if I do not do for David what
the Lord promised him on oath
10and transfer the kingdom from the
house of Saul and establish David's
throne over Israel and Judah from Dan
to Beersheba."
11Ish-Bosheth did not dare to say
another word to Abner, because he was
afraid of him.
12Then Abner sent messengers on his
behalf to say to David, "Whose land is
it? Make an agreement with me, and I
will help you bring all Israel over to you."
13"Good," said David. "I will make an
agreement with you. But I demand one
thing of you: Do not come into my
presence unless you bring Michal
daughter of Saul when you come to see
me."
14Then David sent messengers to Ish-
Bosheth son of Saul, demanding, "Give
me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to
myself for the price of a hundred
Philistine foreskins."
15So Ish-Bosheth gave orders and had
her taken away from her husband Paltiel
son of Laish.
16Her husband, however, went with her,
weeping behind her all the way to
Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Go
back home!" So he went back.
17Abner conferred with the elders of
Israel and said, "For some time you
have wanted to make David your king.
18Now do it! For the Lord promised
David, 'By my servant David I will rescue
my people Israel from the hand of the
Philistines and from the hand of all their
enemies.' "
19Abner also spoke to the Benjamites in
person. Then he went to Hebron to tell
David everything that Israel and the
whole house of Benjamin wanted to do.
20When Abner, who had twenty men
with him, came to David at Hebron,
David prepared a feast for him and his
men.
21Then Abner said to David, "Let me go
at once and assemble all Israel for my
lord the king, so that they may make a
compact with you, and that you may rule
over all that your heart desires." So
David sent Abner away, and he went in
peace.
22Just then David's men and Joab
returned from a raid and brought with
them a great deal of plunder. But Abner
was no longer with David in Hebron,
because David had sent him away, and
he had gone in peace.
23When Joab and all the soldiers with
him arrived, he was told that Abner son
of Ner had come to the king and that the
king had sent him away and that he had
gone in peace.
24So Joab went to the king and said,
"What have you done? Look, Abner
came to you. Why did you let him go?
Now he is gone!
25You know Abner son of Ner; he came
to deceive you and observe your
movements and find out everything you
are doing."
26Joab then left David and sent
messengers after Abner, and they
brought him back from the well of Sirah.
But David did not know it.
27Now when Abner returned to Hebron,
Joab took him aside into the gateway,
as though to speak with him privately.
And there, to avenge the blood of his
brother Asahel, Joab stabbed him in the
stomach, and he died.
28Later, when David heard about this, he
said, "I and my kingdom are forever
innocent before the Lord concerning the
blood of Abner son of Ner.
29May his blood fall upon the head of
Joab and upon all his father's house!
May Joab's house never be without
someone who has a running sore or
leprosy or who leans on a crutch or who
falls by the sword or who lacks food."
30(Joab and his brother Abishai
murdered Abner because he had killed
their brother Asahel in the battle at
Gibeon.)
31Then David said to Joab and all the
people with him, "Tear your clothes and
put on sackcloth and walk in mourning
in front of Abner." King David himself
walked behind the bier.
32They buried Abner in Hebron, and the
king wept aloud at Abner's tomb. All the
people wept also.
33The king sang this lament for Abner:
"Should Abner have died as the lawless
die?
34Your hands were not bound, your feet
were not fettered. You fell as one falls
before wicked men." And all the people
wept over him again.
35Then they all came and urged David to
eat something while it was still day; but
David took an oath, saying, "May God
deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I
taste bread or anything else before the
sun sets!"
36All the people took note and were
pleased; indeed, everything the king did
pleased them.
37So on that day all the people and all
Israel knew that the king had no part in
the murder of Abner son of Ner.
38Then the king said to his men, "Do you
not realize that a prince and a great man
has fallen in Israel this day?
39And today, though I am the anointed
king, I am weak, and these sons of
Zeruiah are too strong for me. May the
Lord repay the evildoer according to his
evil deeds!"
4When Ish-Bosheth son of Saul heard
that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost
courage, and all Israel became alarmed.
2Now Saul's son had two men who were
leaders of raiding bands. One was
named Baanah and the other Recab;
they were sons of Rimmon the
Beerothite from the tribe of Benjamin-
Beeroth is considered part of Benjamin,
3because the people of Beeroth fled to
Gittaim and have lived there as aliens to
this day.
4(Jonathan son of Saul had a son who
was lame in both feet. He was five years
old when the news about Saul and
Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse
picked him up and fled, but as she
hurried to leave, he fell and became
crippled. His name was Mephibosheth.)
5Now Recab and Baanah, the sons of
Rimmon the Beerothite, set out for the
house of Ish-Bosheth, and they arrived
there in the heat of the day while he was
taking his noonday rest.
6They went into the inner part of the
house as if to get some wheat, and they
stabbed him in the stomach. Then
Recab and his brother Baanah slipped
away.
7They had gone into the house while he
was lying on the bed in his bedroom.
After they stabbed and killed him, they
cut off his head. Taking it with them,
they traveled all night by way of the
Arabah.
8They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth
to David at Hebron and said to the king,
"Here is the head of Ish-Bosheth son of
Saul, your enemy, who tried to take your
life. This day the Lord has avenged my
lord the king against Saul and his
offspring."
9David answered Recab and his brother
Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the
Beerothite, "As surely as the Lord lives,
who has delivered me out of all trouble,
10when a man told me, 'Saul is dead,'
and thought he was bringing good news,
I seized him and put him to death in
Ziklag. That was the reward I gave him
for his news!
11How much more-when wicked men
have killed an innocent man in his own
house and on his own bed-should I not
now demand his blood from your hand
and rid the earth of you!"
12So David gave an order to his men,
and they killed them. They cut off their
hands and feet and hung the bodies by
the pool in Hebron. But they took the
head of Ish-Bosheth and buried it in
Abner's tomb at Hebron.
5All the tribes of Israel came to David
at Hebron and said, "We are your own
flesh and blood.
2In the past, while Saul was king over us,
you were the one who led Israel on their
military campaigns. And the Lord said to
you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel,
and you will become their ruler.' "
3When all the elders of Israel had come
to King David at Hebron, the king made
a compact with them at Hebron before
the Lord , and they anointed David king
over Israel.
4David was thirty years old when he
became king, and he reigned forty years.
5In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven
years and six months, and in Jerusalem
he reigned over all Israel and Judah
thirty-three years.
6The king and his men marched to
Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites, who
lived there. The Jebusites said to David,
"You will not get in here; even the blind
and the lame can ward you off." They
thought, "David cannot get in here."
7Nevertheless, David captured the
fortress of Zion, the City of David.
8On that day, David said, "Anyone who
conquers the Jebusites will have to use
the water shaft to reach those 'lame and
blind' who are David's enemies. " That is
why they say, "The 'blind and lame' will
not enter the palace."
9David then took up residence in the
fortress and called it the City of David.
He built up the area around it, from the
supporting terraces inward.
10And he became more and more
powerful, because the Lord God
Almighty was with him.
11Now Hiram king of Tyre sent
messengers to David, along with cedar
logs and carpenters and stonemasons,
and they built a palace for David.
12And David knew that the Lord had
established him as king over Israel and
had exalted his kingdom for the sake of
his people Israel.
13After he left Hebron, David took more
concubines and wives in Jerusalem, and
more sons and daughters were born to
him.
14These are the names of the children
born to him there: Shammua, Shobab,
Nathan, Solomon,
15Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
16Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet.
17When the Philistines heard that David
had been anointed king over Israel, they
went up in full force to search for him,
but David heard about it and went down
to the stronghold.
18Now the Philistines had come and
spread out in the Valley of Rephaim;
19so David inquired of the Lord , "Shall I
go and attack the Philistines? Will you
hand them over to me?" The Lord
answered him, "Go, for I will surely hand
the Philistines over to you."
20So David went to Baal Perazim, and
there he defeated them. He said, "As
waters break out, the Lord has broken
out against my enemies before me." So
that place was called Baal Perazim.
21The Philistines abandoned their idols
there, and David and his men carried
them off.
22Once more the Philistines came up
and spread out in the Valley of
Rephaim;
23so David inquired of the Lord , and he
answered, "Do not go straight up, but
circle around behind them and attack
them in front of the balsam trees.
24As soon as you hear the sound of
marching in the tops of the balsam trees,
move quickly, because that will mean
the Lord has gone out in front of you to
strike the Philistine army."
25So David did as the Lord commanded
him, and he struck down the Philistines
all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
6David again brought together out of
Israel chosen men, thirty thousand in all.
2He and all his men set out from Baalah
of Judah to bring up from there the ark
of God, which is called by the Name, the
name of the Lord Almighty, who is
enthroned between the cherubim that
are on the ark.
3They set the ark of God on a new cart
and brought it from the house of
Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah
and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were
guiding the new cart
4with the ark of God on it, and Ahio was
walking in front of it.
5David and the whole house of Israel
were celebrating with all their might
before the Lord , with songs and with
harps, lyres, tambourines, sistrums and
cymbals.
6When they came to the threshing floor
of Nacon, Uzzah reached out and took
hold of the ark of God, because the
oxen stumbled.
7The Lord 's anger burned against
Uzzah because of his irreverent act;
therefore God struck him down and he
died there beside the ark of God.
8Then David was angry because the
Lord 's wrath had broken out against
Uzzah, and to this day that place is
called Perez Uzzah.
9David was afraid of the Lord that day
and said, "How can the ark of the Lord
ever come to me?"
10He was not willing to take the ark of
the Lord to be with him in the City of
David. Instead, he took it aside to the
house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
11The ark of the Lord remained in the
house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for
three months, and the Lord blessed him
and his entire household.
12Now King David was told, "The Lord
has blessed the household of Obed-
Edom and everything he has, because
of the ark of God." So David went down
and brought up the ark of God from the
house of Obed-Edom to the City of
David with rejoicing.
13When those who were carrying the ark
of the Lord had taken six steps, he
sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf.
14David, wearing a linen ephod, danced
before the Lord with all his might,
15while he and the entire house of Israel
brought up the ark of the Lord with
shouts and the sound of trumpets.
16As the ark of the Lord was entering the
City of David, Michal daughter of Saul
watched from a window. And when she
saw King David leaping and dancing
before the Lord , she despised him in
her heart.
17They brought the ark of the Lord and
set it in its place inside the tent that
David had pitched for it, and David
sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship
offerings before the Lord .
18After he had finished sacrificing the
burnt offerings and fellowship offerings,
he blessed the people in the name of
the Lord Almighty.
19Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake
of dates and a cake of raisins to each
person in the whole crowd of Israelites,
both men and women. And all the
people went to their homes.
20When David returned home to bless
his household, Michal daughter of Saul
came out to meet him and said, "How
the king of Israel has distinguished
himself today, disrobing in the sight of
the slave girls of his servants as any
vulgar fellow would!"
21David said to Michal, "It was before the
Lord , who chose me rather than your
father or anyone from his house when
he appointed me ruler over the Lord 's
people Israel-I will celebrate before the
Lord .
22I will become even more undignified
than this, and I will be humiliated in my
own eyes. But by these slave girls you
spoke of, I will be held in honor."
23And Michal daughter of Saul had no
children to the day of her death.
7After the king was settled in his
palace and the Lord had given him rest
from all his enemies around him,
2he said to Nathan the prophet, "Here I
am, living in a palace of cedar, while the
ark of God remains in a tent."
3Nathan replied to the king, "Whatever
you have in mind, go ahead and do it,
for the Lord is with you."
4That night the word of the Lord came to
Nathan, saying:
5"Go and tell my servant David, 'This is
what the Lord says: Are you the one to
build me a house to dwell in?
6I have not dwelt in a house from the
day I brought the Israelites up out of
Egypt to this day. I have been moving
from place to place with a tent as my
dwelling.
7Wherever I have moved with all the
Israelites, did I ever say to any of their
rulers whom I commanded to shepherd
my people Israel, "Why have you not
built me a house of cedar?" '
8"Now then, tell my servant David, 'This
is what the Lord Almighty says: I took
you from the pasture and from following
the flock to be ruler over my people
Israel.
9I have been with you wherever you
have gone, and I have cut off all your
enemies from before you. Now I will
make your name great, like the names
of the greatest men of the earth.
10And I will provide a place for my
people Israel and will plant them so that
they can have a home of their own and
no longer be disturbed. Wicked people
will not oppress them anymore, as they
did at the beginning
11and have done ever since the time I
appointed leaders over my people Israel.
I will also give you rest from all your
enemies. " 'The Lord declares to you
that the Lord himself will establish a
house for you:
12When your days are over and you rest
with your fathers, I will raise up your
offspring to succeed you, who will come
from your own body, and I will establish
his kingdom.
13He is the one who will build a house
for my Name, and I will establish the
throne of his kingdom forever.
14I will be his father, and he will be my
son. When he does wrong, I will punish
him with the rod of men, with floggings
inflicted by men.
15But my love will never be taken away
from him, as I took it away from Saul,
whom I removed from before you.
16Your house and your kingdom will
endure forever before me ; your throne
will be established forever.' "
17Nathan reported to David all the words
of this entire revelation.
18Then King David went in and sat
before the Lord , and he said: "Who am I,
O Sovereign Lord , and what is my
family, that you have brought me this
far?
19And as if this were not enough in your
sight, O Sovereign Lord , you have also
spoken about the future of the house of
your servant. Is this your usual way of
dealing with man, O Sovereign Lord ?
20"What more can David say to you? For
you know your servant, O Sovereign
Lord .
21For the sake of your word and
according to your will, you have done
this great thing and made it known to
your servant.
22"How great you are, O Sovereign
Lord ! There is no one like you, and
there is no God but you, as we have
heard with our own ears.
23And who is like your people Israel-the
one nation on earth that God went out to
redeem as a people for himself, and to
make a name for himself, and to
perform great and awesome wonders by
driving out nations and their gods from
before your people, whom you
redeemed from Egypt?
24You have established your people
Israel as your very own forever, and you,
O Lord , have become their God.
25"And now, Lord God, keep forever the
promise you have made concerning
your servant and his house. Do as you
promised,
26so that your name will be great forever.
Then men will say, 'The Lord Almighty is
God over Israel!' And the house of your
servant David will be established before
you.
27"O Lord Almighty, God of Israel, you
have revealed this to your servant,
saying, 'I will build a house for you.' So
your servant has found courage to offer
you this prayer.
28O Sovereign Lord , you are God! Your
words are trustworthy, and you have
promised these good things to your
servant.
29Now be pleased to bless the house of
your servant, that it may continue
forever in your sight; for you, O
Sovereign Lord , have spoken, and with
your blessing the house of your servant
will be blessed forever."
8In the course of time, David defeated
the Philistines and subdued them, and
he took Metheg Ammah from the control
of the Philistines.
2David also defeated the Moabites. He
made them lie down on the ground and
measured them off with a length of cord.
Every two lengths of them were put to
death, and the third length was allowed
to live. So the Moabites became subject
to David and brought tribute.
3Moreover, David fought Hadadezer son
of Rehob, king of Zobah, when he went
to restore his control along the
Euphrates River.
4David captured a thousand of his
chariots, seven thousand charioteers
and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He
hamstrung all but a hundred of the
chariot horses.
5When the Arameans of Damascus
came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah,
David struck down twenty-two thousand
of them.
6He put garrisons in the Aramean
kingdom of Damascus, and the
Arameans became subject to him and
brought tribute. The Lord gave David
victory wherever he went.
7David took the gold shields that
belonged to the officers of Hadadezer
and brought them to Jerusalem.
8From Tebah and Berothai, towns that
belonged to Hadadezer, King David took
a great quantity of bronze.
9When Tou king of Hamath heard that
David had defeated the entire army of
Hadadezer,
10he sent his son Joram to King David to
greet him and congratulate him on his
victory in battle over Hadadezer, who
had been at war with Tou. Joram
brought with him articles of silver and
gold and bronze.
11King David dedicated these articles to
the Lord , as he had done with the silver
and gold from all the nations he had
subdued:
12Edom and Moab, the Ammonites and
the Philistines, and Amalek. He also
dedicated the plunder taken from
Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
13And David became famous after he
returned from striking down eighteen
thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
14He put garrisons throughout Edom,
and all the Edomites became subject to
David. The Lord gave David victory
wherever he went.
15David reigned over all Israel, doing
what was just and right for all his people.
16Joab son of Zeruiah was over the
army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was
recorder;
17Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech
son of Abiathar were priests; Seraiah
was secretary;
18Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the
Kerethites and Pelethites; and David's
sons were royal advisers.
9David asked, "Is there anyone still left
of the house of Saul to whom I can
show kindness for Jonathan's sake?"
2Now there was a servant of Saul's
household named Ziba. They called him
to appear before David, and the king
said to him, "Are you Ziba?" "Your
servant," he replied.
3The king asked, "Is there no one still
left of the house of Saul to whom I can
show God's kindness?" Ziba answered
the king, "There is still a son of
Jonathan; he is crippled in both feet."
4"Where is he?" the king asked. Ziba
answered, "He is at the house of Makir
son of Ammiel in Lo Debar."
5So King David had him brought from Lo
Debar, from the house of Makir son of
Ammiel.
6When Mephibosheth son of Jonathan,
the son of Saul, came to David, he
bowed down to pay him honor. David
said, "Mephibosheth!" "Your servant," he
replied.
7"Don't be afraid," David said to him, "for
I will surely show you kindness for the
sake of your father Jonathan. I will
restore to you all the land that belonged
to your grandfather Saul, and you will
always eat at my table."
8Mephibosheth bowed down and said,
"What is your servant, that you should
notice a dead dog like me?"
9Then the king summoned Ziba, Saul's
servant, and said to him, "I have given
your master's grandson everything that
belonged to Saul and his family.
10You and your sons and your servants
are to farm the land for him and bring in
the crops, so that your master's
grandson may be provided for. And
Mephibosheth, grandson of your master,
will always eat at my table." (Now Ziba
had fifteen sons and twenty servants.)
11Then Ziba said to the king, "Your
servant will do whatever my lord the
king commands his servant to do." So
Mephibosheth ate at David's table like
one of the king's sons.
12Mephibosheth had a young son
named Mica, and all the members of
Ziba's household were servants of
Mephibosheth.
13And Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem,
because he always ate at the king's
table, and he was crippled in both feet.
10In the course of time, the king of
the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun
succeeded him as king.
2David thought, "I will show kindness to
Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father
showed kindness to me." So David sent
a delegation to express his sympathy to
Hanun concerning his father. When
David's men came to the land of the
Ammonites,
3the Ammonite nobles said to Hanun
their lord, "Do you think David is
honoring your father by sending men to
you to express sympathy? Hasn't David
sent them to you to explore the city and
spy it out and overthrow it?"
4So Hanun seized David's men, shaved
off half of each man's beard, cut off their
garments in the middle at the buttocks,
and sent them away.
5When David was told about this, he
sent messengers to meet the men, for
they were greatly humiliated. The king
said, "Stay at Jericho till your beards
have grown, and then come back."
6When the Ammonites realized that they
had become a stench in David's nostrils,
they hired twenty thousand Aramean
foot soldiers from Beth Rehob and
Zobah, as well as the king of Maacah
with a thousand men, and also twelve
thousand men from Tob.
7On hearing this, David sent Joab out
with the entire army of fighting men.
8The Ammonites came out and drew up
in battle formation at the entrance to
their city gate, while the Arameans of
Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob
and Maacah were by themselves in the
open country.
9Joab saw that there were battle lines in
front of him and behind him; so he
selected some of the best troops in
Israel and deployed them against the
Arameans.
10He put the rest of the men under the
command of Abishai his brother and
deployed them against the Ammonites.
11Joab said, "If the Arameans are too
strong for me, then you are to come to
my rescue; but if the Ammonites are too
strong for you, then I will come to rescue
you.
12Be strong and let us fight bravely for
our people and the cities of our God.
The Lord will do what is good in his
sight."
13Then Joab and the troops with him
advanced to fight the Arameans, and
they fled before him.
14When the Ammonites saw that the
Arameans were fleeing, they fled before
Abishai and went inside the city. So
Joab returned from fighting the
Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.
15After the Arameans saw that they had
been routed by Israel, they regrouped.
16Hadadezer had Arameans brought
from beyond the River ; they went to
Helam, with Shobach the commander of
Hadadezer's army leading them.
17When David was told of this, he
gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan
and went to Helam. The Arameans
formed their battle lines to meet David
and fought against him.
18But they fled before Israel, and David
killed seven hundred of their charioteers
and forty thousand of their foot soldiers.
He also struck down Shobach the
commander of their army, and he died
there.
19When all the kings who were vassals
of Hadadezer saw that they had been
defeated by Israel, they made peace
with the Israelites and became subject
to them. So the Arameans were afraid to
help the Ammonites anymore.
11In the spring, at the time when
kings go off to war, David sent Joab out
with the king's men and the whole
Israelite army. They destroyed the
Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But
David remained in Jerusalem.
2One evening David got up from his bed
and walked around on the roof of the
palace. From the roof he saw a woman
bathing. The woman was very beautiful,
3and David sent someone to find out
about her. The man said, "Isn't this
Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and
the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
4Then David sent messengers to get her.
She came to him, and he slept with her.
(She had purified herself from her
uncleanness.) Then she went back
home.
5The woman conceived and sent word
to David, saying, "I am pregnant."
6So David sent this word to Joab: "Send
me Uriah the Hittite." And Joab sent him
to David.
7When Uriah came to him, David asked
him how Joab was, how the soldiers
were and how the war was going.
8Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to
your house and wash your feet." So
Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the
king was sent after him.
9But Uriah slept at the entrance to the
palace with all his master's servants and
did not go down to his house.
10When David was told, "Uriah did not
go home," he asked him, "Haven't you
just come from a distance? Why didn't
you go home?"
11Uriah said to David, "The ark and
Israel and Judah are staying in tents,
and my master Joab and my lord's men
are camped in the open fields. How
could I go to my house to eat and drink
and lie with my wife? As surely as you
live, I will not do such a thing!"
12Then David said to him, "Stay here
one more day, and tomorrow I will send
you back." So Uriah remained in
Jerusalem that day and the next.
13At David's invitation, he ate and drank
with him, and David made him drunk.
But in the evening Uriah went out to
sleep on his mat among his master's
servants; he did not go home.
14In the morning David wrote a letter to
Joab and sent it with Uriah.
15In it he wrote, "Put Uriah in the front
line where the fighting is fiercest. Then
withdraw from him so he will be struck
down and die."
16So while Joab had the city under siege,
he put Uriah at a place where he knew
the strongest defenders were.
17When the men of the city came out
and fought against Joab, some of the
men in David's army fell; moreover,
Uriah the Hittite died.
18Joab sent David a full account of the
battle.
19He instructed the messenger: "When
you have finished giving the king this
account of the battle,
20the king's anger may flare up, and he
may ask you, 'Why did you get so close
to the city to fight? Didn't you know they
would shoot arrows from the wall?
21Who killed Abimelech son of Jerub-
Besheth ? Didn't a woman throw an
upper millstone on him from the wall, so
that he died in Thebez? Why did you get
so close to the wall?' If he asks you this,
then say to him, 'Also, your servant
Uriah the Hittite is dead.' "
22The messenger set out, and when he
arrived he told David everything Joab
had sent him to say.
23The messenger said to David, "The
men overpowered us and came out
against us in the open, but we drove
them back to the entrance to the city
gate.
24Then the archers shot arrows at your
servants from the wall, and some of the
king's men died. Moreover, your servant
Uriah the Hittite is dead."
25David told the messenger, "Say this to
Joab: 'Don't let this upset you; the sword
devours one as well as another. Press
the attack against the city and destroy
it.' Say this to encourage Joab."
26When Uriah's wife heard that her
husband was dead, she mourned for
him.
27After the time of mourning was over,
David had her brought to his house, and
she became his wife and bore him a son.
But the thing David had done displeased
the Lord .
12The Lord sent Nathan to David.
When he came to him, he said, "There
were two men in a certain town, one rich
and the other poor.
2The rich man had a very large number
of sheep and cattle,
3but the poor man had nothing except
one little ewe lamb he had bought. He
raised it, and it grew up with him and his
children. It shared his food, drank from
his cup and even slept in his arms. It
was like a daughter to him.
4"Now a traveler came to the rich man,
but the rich man refrained from taking
one of his own sheep or cattle to
prepare a meal for the traveler who had
come to him. Instead, he took the ewe
lamb that belonged to the poor man and
prepared it for the one who had come to
him."
5David burned with anger against the
man and said to Nathan, "As surely as
the Lord lives, the man who did this
deserves to die!
6He must pay for that lamb four times
over, because he did such a thing and
had no pity."
7Then Nathan said to David, "You are
the man! This is what the Lord , the God
of Israel, says: 'I anointed you king over
Israel, and I delivered you from the hand
of Saul.
8I gave your master's house to you, and
your master's wives into your arms. I
gave you the house of Israel and Judah.
And if all this had been too little, I would
have given you even more.
9Why did you despise the word of the
Lord by doing what is evil in his eyes?
You struck down Uriah the Hittite with
the sword and took his wife to be your
own. You killed him with the sword of
the Ammonites.
10Now, therefore, the sword will never
depart from your house, because you
despised me and took the wife of Uriah
the Hittite to be your own.'
11"This is what the Lord says: 'Out of
your own household I am going to bring
calamity upon you. Before your very
eyes I will take your wives and give
them to one who is close to you, and he
will lie with your wives in broad daylight.
12You did it in secret, but I will do this
thing in broad daylight before all Israel.'
"
13Then David said to Nathan, "I have
sinned against the Lord ." Nathan
replied, "The Lord has taken away your
sin. You are not going to die.
14But because by doing this you have
made the enemies of the Lord show
utter contempt, the son born to you will
die."
15After Nathan had gone home, the Lord
struck the child that Uriah's wife had
borne to David, and he became ill.
16David pleaded with God for the child.
He fasted and went into his house and
spent the nights lying on the ground.
17The elders of his household stood
beside him to get him up from the
ground, but he refused, and he would
not eat any food with them.
18On the seventh day the child died.
David's servants were afraid to tell him
that the child was dead, for they thought,
"While the child was still living, we spoke
to David but he would not listen to us.
How can we tell him the child is dead?
He may do something desperate."
19David noticed that his servants were
whispering among themselves and he
realized the child was dead. "Is the child
dead?" he asked. "Yes," they replied,
"he is dead."
20Then David got up from the ground.
After he had washed, put on lotions and
changed his clothes, he went into the
house of the Lord and worshiped. Then
he went to his own house, and at his
request they served him food, and he
ate.
21His servants asked him, "Why are you
acting this way? While the child was
alive, you fasted and wept, but now that
the child is dead, you get up and eat!"
22He answered, "While the child was still
alive, I fasted and wept. I thought, 'Who
knows? The Lord may be gracious to
me and let the child live.'
23But now that he is dead, why should I
fast? Can I bring him back again? I will
go to him, but he will not return to me."
24Then David comforted his wife
Bathsheba, and he went to her and lay
with her. She gave birth to a son, and
they named him Solomon. The Lord
loved him;
25and because the Lord loved him, he
sent word through Nathan the prophet to
name him Jedidiah.
26Meanwhile Joab fought against
Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured
the royal citadel.
27Joab then sent messengers to David,
saying, "I have fought against Rabbah
and taken its water supply.
28Now muster the rest of the troops and
besiege the city and capture it.
Otherwise I will take the city, and it will
be named after me."
29So David mustered the entire army
and went to Rabbah, and attacked and
captured it.
30He took the crown from the head of
their king -its weight was a talent of gold,
and it was set with precious stones-and
it was placed on David's head. He took
a great quantity of plunder from the city
31and brought out the people who were
there, consigning them to labor with
saws and with iron picks and axes, and
he made them work at brickmaking. He
did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then
David and his entire army returned to
Jerusalem.
13In the course of time, Amnon son
of David fell in love with Tamar, the
beautiful sister of Absalom son of David.
2Amnon became frustrated to the point
of illness on account of his sister Tamar,
for she was a virgin, and it seemed
impossible for him to do anything to her.
3Now Amnon had a friend named
Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's
brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd
man.
4He asked Amnon, "Why do you, the
king's son, look so haggard morning
after morning? Won't you tell me?"
Amnon said to him, "I'm in love with
Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."
5"Go to bed and pretend to be ill,"
Jonadab said. "When your father comes
to see you, say to him, 'I would like my
sister Tamar to come and give me
something to eat. Let her prepare the
food in my sight so I may watch her and
then eat it from her hand.' "
6So Amnon lay down and pretended to
be ill. When the king came to see him,
Amnon said to him, "I would like my
sister Tamar to come and make some
special bread in my sight, so I may eat
from her hand."
7David sent word to Tamar at the
palace: "Go to the house of your brother
Amnon and prepare some food for him."
8So Tamar went to the house of her
brother Amnon, who was lying down.
She took some dough, kneaded it, made
the bread in his sight and baked it.
9Then she took the pan and served him
the bread, but he refused to eat. "Send
everyone out of here," Amnon said. So
everyone left him.
10Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the
food here into my bedroom so I may eat
from your hand." And Tamar took the
bread she had prepared and brought it
to her brother Amnon in his bedroom.
11But when she took it to him to eat, he
grabbed her and said, "Come to bed
with me, my sister."
12"Don't, my brother!" she said to him.
"Don't force me. Such a thing should not
be done in Israel! Don't do this wicked
thing.
13What about me? Where could I get rid
of my disgrace? And what about you?
You would be like one of the wicked
fools in Israel. Please speak to the king;
he will not keep me from being married
to you."
14But he refused to listen to her, and
since he was stronger than she, he
raped her.
15Then Amnon hated her with intense
hatred. In fact, he hated her more than
he had loved her. Amnon said to her,
"Get up and get out!"
16"No!" she said to him. "Sending me
away would be a greater wrong than
what you have already done to me." But
he refused to listen to her.
17He called his personal servant and
said, "Get this woman out of here and
bolt the door after her."
18So his servant put her out and bolted
the door after her. She was wearing a
richly ornamented robe, for this was the
kind of garment the virgin daughters of
the king wore.
19Tamar put ashes on her head and tore
the ornamented robe she was wearing.
She put her hand on her head and went
away, weeping aloud as she went.
20Her brother Absalom said to her, "Has
that Amnon, your brother, been with
you? Be quiet now, my sister; he is your
brother. Don't take this thing to heart."
And Tamar lived in her brother
Absalom's house, a desolate woman.
21When King David heard all this, he
was furious.
22Absalom never said a word to Amnon,
either good or bad; he hated Amnon
because he had disgraced his sister
Tamar.
23Two years later, when Absalom's
sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near
the border of Ephraim, he invited all the
king's sons to come there.
24Absalom went to the king and said,
"Your servant has had shearers come.
Will the king and his officials please join
me?"
25"No, my son," the king replied. "All of
us should not go; we would only be a
burden to you." Although Absalom urged
him, he still refused to go, but gave him
his blessing.
26Then Absalom said, "If not, please let
my brother Amnon come with us." The
king asked him, "Why should he go with
you?"
27But Absalom urged him, so he sent
with him Amnon and the rest of the
king's sons.
28Absalom ordered his men, "Listen!
When Amnon is in high spirits from
drinking wine and I say to you, 'Strike
Amnon down,' then kill him. Don't be
afraid. Have not I given you this order?
Be strong and brave."
29So Absalom's men did to Amnon what
Absalom had ordered. Then all the
king's sons got up, mounted their mules
and fled.
30While they were on their way, the
report came to David: "Absalom has
struck down all the king's sons; not one
of them is left."
31The king stood up, tore his clothes and
lay down on the ground; and all his
servants stood by with their clothes torn.
32But Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's
brother, said, "My lord should not think
that they killed all the princes; only
Amnon is dead. This has been
Absalom's expressed intention ever
since the day Amnon raped his sister
Tamar.
33My lord the king should not be
concerned about the report that all the
king's sons are dead. Only Amnon is
dead."
34Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. Now
the man standing watch looked up and
saw many people on the road west of
him, coming down the side of the hill.
The watchman went and told the king, "I
see men in the direction of Horonaim,
on the side of the hill."
35Jonadab said to the king, "See, the
king's sons are here; it has happened
just as your servant said."
36As he finished speaking, the king's
sons came in, wailing loudly. The king,
too, and all his servants wept very
bitterly.
37Absalom fled and went to Talmai son
of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But
King David mourned for his son every
day.
38After Absalom fled and went to Geshur,
he stayed there three years.
39And the spirit of the king longed to go
to Absalom, for he was consoled
concerning Amnon's death.
14Joab son of Zeruiah knew that the
king's heart longed for Absalom.
2So Joab sent someone to Tekoa and
had a wise woman brought from there.
He said to her, "Pretend you are in
mourning. Dress in mourning clothes,
and don't use any cosmetic lotions. Act
like a woman who has spent many days
grieving for the dead.
3Then go to the king and speak these
words to him." And Joab put the words
in her mouth.
4When the woman from Tekoa went to
the king, she fell with her face to the
ground to pay him honor, and she said,
"Help me, O king!"
5The king asked her, "What is troubling
you?" She said, "I am indeed a widow;
my husband is dead.
6I your servant had two sons. They got
into a fight with each other in the field,
and no one was there to separate them.
One struck the other and killed him.
7Now the whole clan has risen up
against your servant; they say, 'Hand
over the one who struck his brother
down, so that we may put him to death
for the life of his brother whom he killed;
then we will get rid of the heir as well.'
They would put out the only burning coal
I have left, leaving my husband neither
name nor descendant on the face of the
earth."
8The king said to the woman, "Go home,
and I will issue an order in your behalf."
9But the woman from Tekoa said to him,
"My lord the king, let the blame rest on
me and on my father's family, and let the
king and his throne be without guilt."
10The king replied, "If anyone says
anything to you, bring him to me, and he
will not bother you again."
11She said, "Then let the king invoke the
Lord his God to prevent the avenger of
blood from adding to the destruction, so
that my son will not be destroyed." "As
surely as the Lord lives," he said, "not
one hair of your son's head will fall to
the ground."
12Then the woman said, "Let your
servant speak a word to my lord the
king." "Speak," he replied.
13The woman said, "Why then have you
devised a thing like this against the
people of God? When the king says this,
does he not convict himself, for the king
has not brought back his banished son?
14Like water spilled on the ground, which
cannot be recovered, so we must die.
But God does not take away life; instead,
he devises ways so that a banished
person may not remain estranged from
him.
15"And now I have come to say this to
my lord the king because the people
have made me afraid. Your servant
thought, 'I will speak to the king;
perhaps he will do what his servant asks.
16Perhaps the king will agree to deliver
his servant from the hand of the man
who is trying to cut off both me and my
son from the inheritance God gave us.'
17"And now your servant says, 'May the
word of my lord the king bring me rest,
for my lord the king is like an angel of
God in discerning good and evil. May
the Lord your God be with you.' "
18Then the king said to the woman, "Do
not keep from me the answer to what I
am going to ask you." "Let my lord the
king speak," the woman said.
19The king asked, "Isn't the hand of Joab
with you in all this?" The woman
answered, "As surely as you live, my
lord the king, no one can turn to the right
or to the left from anything my lord the
king says. Yes, it was your servant Joab
who instructed me to do this and who
put all these words into the mouth of
your servant.
20Your servant Joab did this to change
the present situation. My lord has
wisdom like that of an angel of God-he
knows everything that happens in the
land."
21The king said to Joab, "Very well, I will
do it. Go, bring back the young man
Absalom."
22Joab fell with his face to the ground to
pay him honor, and he blessed the king.
Joab said, "Today your servant knows
that he has found favor in your eyes, my
lord the king, because the king has
granted his servant's request."
23Then Joab went to Geshur and
brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.
24But the king said, "He must go to his
own house; he must not see my face."
So Absalom went to his own house and
did not see the face of the king.
25In all Israel there was not a man so
highly praised for his handsome
appearance as Absalom. From the top
of his head to the sole of his foot there
was no blemish in him.
26Whenever he cut the hair of his headhe
used to cut his hair from time to time
when it became too heavy for him-he
would weigh it, and its weight was two
hundred shekels by the royal standard.
27Three sons and a daughter were born
to Absalom. The daughter's name was
Tamar, and she became a beautiful
woman.
28Absalom lived two years in Jerusalem
without seeing the king's face.
29Then Absalom sent for Joab in order
to send him to the king, but Joab
refused to come to him. So he sent a
second time, but he refused to come.
30Then he said to his servants, "Look,
Joab's field is next to mine, and he has
barley there. Go and set it on fire." So
Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
31Then Joab did go to Absalom's house
and he said to him, "Why have your
servants set my field on fire?"
32Absalom said to Joab, "Look, I sent
word to you and said, 'Come here so I
can send you to the king to ask, "Why
have I come from Geshur? It would be
better for me if I were still there!" ' Now
then, I want to see the king's face, and if
I am guilty of anything, let him put me to
death."
33So Joab went to the king and told him
this. Then the king summoned Absalom,
and he came in and bowed down with
his face to the ground before the king.
And the king kissed Absalom.
15In the course of time, Absalom
provided himself with a chariot and
horses and with fifty men to run ahead
of him.
2He would get up early and stand by the
side of the road leading to the city gate.
Whenever anyone came with a
complaint to be placed before the king
for a decision, Absalom would call out to
him, "What town are you from?" He
would answer, "Your servant is from one
of the tribes of Israel."
3Then Absalom would say to him, "Look,
your claims are valid and proper, but
there is no representative of the king to
hear you."
4And Absalom would add, "If only I were
appointed judge in the land! Then
everyone who has a complaint or case
could come to me and I would see that
he gets justice."
5Also, whenever anyone approached
him to bow down before him, Absalom
would reach out his hand, take hold of
him and kiss him.
6Absalom behaved in this way toward all
the Israelites who came to the king
asking for justice, and so he stole the
hearts of the men of Israel.
7At the end of four years, Absalom said
to the king, "Let me go to Hebron and
fulfill a vow I made to the Lord .
8While your servant was living at Geshur
in Aram, I made this vow: 'If the Lord
takes me back to Jerusalem, I will
worship the Lord in Hebron. ' "
9The king said to him, "Go in peace." So
he went to Hebron.
10Then Absalom sent secret
messengers throughout the tribes of
Israel to say, "As soon as you hear the
sound of the trumpets, then say,
'Absalom is king in Hebron.' "
11Two hundred men from Jerusalem had
accompanied Absalom. They had been
invited as guests and went quite
innocently, knowing nothing about the
matter.
12While Absalom was offering sacrifices,
he also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite,
David's counselor, to come from Giloh,
his hometown. And so the conspiracy
gained strength, and Absalom's
following kept on increasing.
13A messenger came and told David,
"The hearts of the men of Israel are with
Absalom."
14Then David said to all his officials who
were with him in Jerusalem, "Come! We
must flee, or none of us will escape from
Absalom. We must leave immediately,
or he will move quickly to overtake us
and bring ruin upon us and put the city
to the sword."
15The king's officials answered him,
"Your servants are ready to do whatever
our lord the king chooses."
16The king set out, with his entire
household following him; but he left ten
concubines to take care of the palace.
17So the king set out, with all the people
following him, and they halted at a place
some distance away.
18All his men marched past him, along
with all the Kerethites and Pelethites;
and all the six hundred Gittites who had
accompanied him from Gath marched
before the king.
19The king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why
should you come along with us? Go
back and stay with King Absalom. You
are a foreigner, an exile from your
homeland.
20You came only yesterday. And today
shall I make you wander about with us,
when I do not know where I am going?
Go back, and take your countrymen.
May kindness and faithfulness be with
you."
21But Ittai replied to the king, "As surely
as the Lord lives, and as my lord the
king lives, wherever my lord the king
may be, whether it means life or death,
there will your servant be."
22David said to Ittai, "Go ahead, march
on." So Ittai the Gittite marched on with
all his men and the families that were
with him.
23The whole countryside wept aloud as
all the people passed by. The king also
crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the
people moved on toward the desert.
24Zadok was there, too, and all the
Levites who were with him were carrying
the ark of the covenant of God. They set
down the ark of God, and Abiathar
offered sacrifices until all the people had
finished leaving the city.
25Then the king said to Zadok, "Take the
ark of God back into the city. If I find
favor in the Lord 's eyes, he will bring
me back and let me see it and his
dwelling place again.
26But if he says, 'I am not pleased with
you,' then I am ready; let him do to me
whatever seems good to him."
27The king also said to Zadok the priest,
"Aren't you a seer? Go back to the city
in peace, with your son Ahimaaz and
Jonathan son of Abiathar. You and
Abiathar take your two sons with you.
28I will wait at the fords in the desert until
word comes from you to inform me."
29So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of
God back to Jerusalem and stayed
there.
30But David continued up the Mount of
Olives, weeping as he went; his head
was covered and he was barefoot. All
the people with him covered their heads
too and were weeping as they went up.
31Now David had been told, "Ahithophel
is among the conspirators with
Absalom." So David prayed, "O Lord ,
turn Ahithophel's counsel into
foolishness."
32When David arrived at the summit,
where people used to worship God,
Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him,
his robe torn and dust on his head.
33David said to him, "If you go with me,
you will be a burden to me.
34But if you return to the city and say to
Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king;
I was your father's servant in the past,
but now I will be your servant,' then you
can help me by frustrating Ahithophel's
advice.
35Won't the priests Zadok and Abiathar
be there with you? Tell them anything
you hear in the king's palace.
36Their two sons, Ahimaaz son of Zadok
and Jonathan son of Abiathar, are there
with them. Send them to me with
anything you hear."
37So David's friend Hushai arrived at
Jerusalem as Absalom was entering the
city.
16When David had gone a short
distance beyond the summit, there was
Ziba, the steward of Mephibosheth,
waiting to meet him. He had a string of
donkeys saddled and loaded with two
hundred loaves of bread, a hundred
cakes of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs
and a skin of wine.
2The king asked Ziba, "Why have you
brought these?" Ziba answered, "The
donkeys are for the king's household to
ride on, the bread and fruit are for the
men to eat, and the wine is to refresh
those who become exhausted in the
desert."
3The king then asked, "Where is your
master's grandson?" Ziba said to him,
"He is staying in Jerusalem, because he
thinks, 'Today the house of Israel will
give me back my grandfather's
kingdom.' "
4Then the king said to Ziba, "All that
belonged to Mephibosheth is now
yours." "I humbly bow," Ziba said. "May I
find favor in your eyes, my lord the
king."
5As King David approached Bahurim, a
man from the same clan as Saul's family
came out from there. His name was
Shimei son of Gera, and he cursed as
he came out.
6He pelted David and all the king's
officials with stones, though all the
troops and the special guard were on
David's right and left.
7As he cursed, Shimei said, "Get out,
get out, you man of blood, you
scoundrel!
8The Lord has repaid you for all the
blood you shed in the household of Saul,
in whose place you have reigned. The
Lord has handed the kingdom over to
your son Absalom. You have come to
ruin because you are a man of blood!"
9Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the
king, "Why should this dead dog curse
my lord the king? Let me go over and
cut off his head."
10But the king said, "What do you and I
have in common, you sons of Zeruiah?
If he is cursing because the Lord said to
him, 'Curse David,' who can ask, 'Why
do you do this?' "
11David then said to Abishai and all his
officials, "My son, who is of my own
flesh, is trying to take my life. How much
more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him
alone; let him curse, for the Lord has
told him to.
12It may be that the Lord will see my
distress and repay me with good for the
cursing I am receiving today."
13So David and his men continued along
the road while Shimei was going along
the hillside opposite him, cursing as he
went and throwing stones at him and
showering him with dirt.
14The king and all the people with him
arrived at their destination exhausted.
And there he refreshed himself.
15Meanwhile, Absalom and all the men
of Israel came to Jerusalem, and
Ahithophel was with him.
16Then Hushai the Arkite, David's friend,
went to Absalom and said to him, "Long
live the king! Long live the king!"
17Absalom asked Hushai, "Is this the
love you show your friend? Why didn't
you go with your friend?"
18Hushai said to Absalom, "No, the one
chosen by the Lord , by these people,
and by all the men of Israel-his I will be,
and I will remain with him.
19Furthermore, whom should I serve?
Should I not serve the son? Just as I
served your father, so I will serve you."
20Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give us
your advice. What should we do?"
21Ahithophel answered, "Lie with your
father's concubines whom he left to take
care of the palace. Then all Israel will
hear that you have made yourself a
stench in your father's nostrils, and the
hands of everyone with you will be
strengthened."
22So they pitched a tent for Absalom on
the roof, and he lay with his father's
concubines in the sight of all Israel.
23Now in those days the advice
Ahithophel gave was like that of one
who inquires of God. That was how both
David and Absalom regarded all of
Ahithophel's advice.
17Ahithophel said to Absalom, "I
would choose twelve thousand men and
set out tonight in pursuit of David.
2I would attack him while he is weary
and weak. I would strike him with terror,
and then all the people with him will flee.
I would strike down only the king
3and bring all the people back to you.
The death of the man you seek will
mean the return of all; all the people will
be unharmed."
4This plan seemed good to Absalom and
to all the elders of Israel.
5But Absalom said, "Summon also
Hushai the Arkite, so we can hear what
he has to say."
6When Hushai came to him, Absalom
said, "Ahithophel has given this advice.
Should we do what he says? If not, give
us your opinion."
7Hushai replied to Absalom, "The advice
Ahithophel has given is not good this
time.
8You know your father and his men; they
are fighters, and as fierce as a wild bear
robbed of her cubs. Besides, your father
is an experienced fighter; he will not
spend the night with the troops.
9Even now, he is hidden in a cave or
some other place. If he should attack
your troops first, whoever hears about it
will say, 'There has been a slaughter
among the troops who follow Absalom.'
10Then even the bravest soldier, whose
heart is like the heart of a lion, will melt
with fear, for all Israel knows that your
father is a fighter and that those with
him are brave.
11"So I advise you: Let all Israel, from
Dan to Beersheba-as numerous as the
sand on the seashore-be gathered to
you, with you yourself leading them into
battle.
12Then we will attack him wherever he
may be found, and we will fall on him as
dew settles on the ground. Neither he
nor any of his men will be left alive.
13If he withdraws into a city, then all
Israel will bring ropes to that city, and
we will drag it down to the valley until
not even a piece of it can be found."
14Absalom and all the men of Israel said,
"The advice of Hushai the Arkite is
better than that of Ahithophel." For the
Lord had determined to frustrate the
good advice of Ahithophel in order to
bring disaster on Absalom.
15Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the
priests, "Ahithophel has advised
Absalom and the elders of Israel to do
such and such, but I have advised them
to do so and so.
16Now send a message immediately and
tell David, 'Do not spend the night at the
fords in the desert; cross over without
fail, or the king and all the people with
him will be swallowed up.' "
17Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at
En Rogel. A servant girl was to go and
inform them, and they were to go and
tell King David, for they could not risk
being seen entering the city.
18But a young man saw them and told
Absalom. So the two of them left quickly
and went to the house of a man in
Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard,
and they climbed down into it.
19His wife took a covering and spread it
out over the opening of the well and
scattered grain over it. No one knew
anything about it.
20When Absalom's men came to the
woman at the house, they asked,
"Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?"
The woman answered them, "They
crossed over the brook." The men
searched but found no one, so they
returned to Jerusalem.
21After the men had gone, the two
climbed out of the well and went to
inform King David. They said to him,
"Set out and cross the river at once;
Ahithophel has advised such and such
against you."
22So David and all the people with him
set out and crossed the Jordan. By
daybreak, no one was left who had not
crossed the Jordan.
23When Ahithophel saw that his advice
had not been followed, he saddled his
donkey and set out for his house in his
hometown. He put his house in order
and then hanged himself. So he died
and was buried in his father's tomb.
24David went to Mahanaim, and
Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the
men of Israel.
25Absalom had appointed Amasa over
the army in place of Joab. Amasa was
the son of a man named Jether, an
Israelite who had married Abigail, the
daughter of Nahash and sister of
Zeruiah the mother of Joab.
26The Israelites and Absalom camped in
the land of Gilead.
27When David came to Mahanaim,
Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of
the Ammonites, and Makir son of
Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the
Gileadite from Rogelim
28brought bedding and bowls and
articles of pottery. They also brought
wheat and barley, flour and roasted
grain, beans and lentils,
29honey and curds, sheep, and cheese
from cows' milk for David and his people
to eat. For they said, "The people have
become hungry and tired and thirsty in
the desert."
18David mustered the men who
were with him and appointed over them
commanders of thousands and
commanders of hundreds.
2David sent the troops out-a third under
the command of Joab, a third under
Joab's brother Abishai son of Zeruiah,
and a third under Ittai the Gittite. The
king told the troops, "I myself will surely
march out with you."
3But the men said, "You must not go
out; if we are forced to flee, they won't
care about us. Even if half of us die,
they won't care; but you are worth ten
thousand of us. It would be better now
for you to give us support from the city."
4The king answered, "I will do whatever
seems best to you." So the king stood
beside the gate while all the men
marched out in units of hundreds and of
thousands.
5The king commanded Joab, Abishai
and Ittai, "Be gentle with the young man
Absalom for my sake." And all the
troops heard the king giving orders
concerning Absalom to each of the
commanders.
6The army marched into the field to fight
Israel, and the battle took place in the
forest of Ephraim.
7There the army of Israel was defeated
by David's men, and the casualties that
day were great-twenty thousand men.
8The battle spread out over the whole
countryside, and the forest claimed
more lives that day than the sword.
9Now Absalom happened to meet
David's men. He was riding his mule,
and as the mule went under the thick
branches of a large oak, Absalom's
head got caught in the tree. He was left
hanging in midair, while the mule he
was riding kept on going.
10When one of the men saw this, he told
Joab, "I just saw Absalom hanging in an
oak tree."
11Joab said to the man who had told him
this, "What! You saw him? Why didn't
you strike him to the ground right there?
Then I would have had to give you ten
shekels of silver and a warrior's belt."
12But the man replied, "Even if a
thousand shekels were weighed out into
my hands, I would not lift my hand
against the king's son. In our hearing the
king commanded you and Abishai and
Ittai, 'Protect the young man Absalom
for my sake. '
13And if I had put my life in jeopardy -
and nothing is hidden from the king-you
would have kept your distance from
me."
14Joab said, "I'm not going to wait like
this for you." So he took three javelins in
his hand and plunged them into
Absalom's heart while Absalom was still
alive in the oak tree.
15And ten of Joab's armor-bearers
surrounded Absalom, struck him and
killed him.
16Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and
the troops stopped pursuing Israel, for
Joab halted them.
17They took Absalom, threw him into a
big pit in the forest and piled up a large
heap of rocks over him. Meanwhile, all
the Israelites fled to their homes.
18During his lifetime Absalom had taken
a pillar and erected it in the King's Valley
as a monument to himself, for he
thought, "I have no son to carry on the
memory of my name." He named the
pillar after himself, and it is called
Absalom's Monument to this day.
19Now Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, "Let
me run and take the news to the king
that the Lord has delivered him from the
hand of his enemies."
20"You are not the one to take the news
today," Joab told him. "You may take the
news another time, but you must not do
so today, because the king's son is
dead."
21Then Joab said to a Cushite, "Go, tell
the king what you have seen." The
Cushite bowed down before Joab and
ran off.
22Ahimaaz son of Zadok again said to
Joab, "Come what may, please let me
run behind the Cushite." But Joab
replied, "My son, why do you want to
go? You don't have any news that will
bring you a reward."
23He said, "Come what may, I want to
run." So Joab said, "Run!" Then
Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and
outran the Cushite.
24While David was sitting between the
inner and outer gates, the watchman
went up to the roof of the gateway by
the wall. As he looked out, he saw a
man running alone.
25The watchman called out to the king
and reported it. The king said, "If he is
alone, he must have good news." And
the man came closer and closer.
26Then the watchman saw another man
running, and he called down to the
gatekeeper, "Look, another man running
alone!" The king said, "He must be
bringing good news, too."
27The watchman said, "It seems to me
that the first one runs like Ahimaaz son
of Zadok." "He's a good man," the king
said. "He comes with good news."
28Then Ahimaaz called out to the king,
"All is well!" He bowed down before the
king with his face to the ground and said,
"Praise be to the Lord your God! He has
delivered up the men who lifted their
hands against my lord the king."
29The king asked, "Is the young man
Absalom safe?" Ahimaaz answered, "I
saw great confusion just as Joab was
about to send the king's servant and me,
your servant, but I don't know what it
was."
30The king said, "Stand aside and wait
here." So he stepped aside and stood
there.
31Then the Cushite arrived and said, "My
lord the king, hear the good news! The
Lord has delivered you today from all
who rose up against you."
32The king asked the Cushite, "Is the
young man Absalom safe?" The Cushite
replied, "May the enemies of my lord the
king and all who rise up to harm you be
like that young man."
33The king was shaken. He went up to
the room over the gateway and wept. As
he went, he said: "O my son Absalom!
My son, my son Absalom! If only I had
died instead of you-O Absalom, my son,
my son!"
19Joab was told, "The king is
weeping and mourning for Absalom."
2And for the whole army the victory that
day was turned into mourning, because
on that day the troops heard it said,
"The king is grieving for his son."
3The men stole into the city that day as
men steal in who are ashamed when
they flee from battle.
4The king covered his face and cried
aloud, "O my son Absalom! O Absalom,
my son, my son!"
5Then Joab went into the house to the
king and said, "Today you have
humiliated all your men, who have just
saved your life and the lives of your
sons and daughters and the lives of
your wives and concubines.
6You love those who hate you and hate
those who love you. You have made it
clear today that the commanders and
their men mean nothing to you. I see
that you would be pleased if Absalom
were alive today and all of us were dead.
7Now go out and encourage your men. I
swear by the Lord that if you don't go
out, not a man will be left with you by
nightfall. This will be worse for you than
all the calamities that have come upon
you from your youth till now."
8So the king got up and took his seat in
the gateway. When the men were told,
"The king is sitting in the gateway," they
all came before him. Meanwhile, the
Israelites had fled to their homes.
9Throughout the tribes of Israel, the
people were all arguing with each other,
saying, "The king delivered us from the
hand of our enemies; he is the one who
rescued us from the hand of the
Philistines. But now he has fled the
country because of Absalom;
10and Absalom, whom we anointed to
rule over us, has died in battle. So why
do you say nothing about bringing the
king back?"
11King David sent this message to
Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: "Ask
the elders of Judah, 'Why should you be
the last to bring the king back to his
palace, since what is being said
throughout Israel has reached the king
at his quarters?
12You are my brothers, my own flesh
and blood. So why should you be the
last to bring back the king?'
13And say to Amasa, 'Are you not my
own flesh and blood? May God deal
with me, be it ever so severely, if from
now on you are not the commander of
my army in place of Joab.' "
14He won over the hearts of all the men
of Judah as though they were one man.
They sent word to the king, "Return, you
and all your men."
15Then the king returned and went as far
as the Jordan. Now the men of Judah
had come to Gilgal to go out and meet
the king and bring him across the
Jordan.
16Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite
from Bahurim, hurried down with the
men of Judah to meet King David.
17With him were a thousand Benjamites,
along with Ziba, the steward of Saul's
household, and his fifteen sons and
twenty servants. They rushed to the
Jordan, where the king was.
18They crossed at the ford to take the
king's household over and to do
whatever he wished. When Shimei son
of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell
prostrate before the king
19and said to him, "May my lord not hold
me guilty. Do not remember how your
servant did wrong on the day my lord
the king left Jerusalem. May the king put
it out of his mind.
20For I your servant know that I have
sinned, but today I have come here as
the first of the whole house of Joseph to
come down and meet my lord the king."
21Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said,
"Shouldn't Shimei be put to death for
this? He cursed the Lord 's anointed."
22David replied, "What do you and I
have in common, you sons of Zeruiah?
This day you have become my
adversaries! Should anyone be put to
death in Israel today? Do I not know that
today I am king over Israel?"
23So the king said to Shimei, "You shall
not die." And the king promised him on
oath.
24Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson, also
went down to meet the king. He had not
taken care of his feet or trimmed his
mustache or washed his clothes from
the day the king left until the day he
returned safely.
25When he came from Jerusalem to
meet the king, the king asked him, "Why
didn't you go with me, Mephibosheth?"
26He said, "My lord the king, since I your
servant am lame, I said, 'I will have my
donkey saddled and will ride on it, so I
can go with the king.' But Ziba my
servant betrayed me.
27And he has slandered your servant to
my lord the king. My lord the king is like
an angel of God; so do whatever
pleases you.
28All my grandfather's descendants
deserved nothing but death from my lord
the king, but you gave your servant a
place among those who eat at your
table. So what right do I have to make
any more appeals to the king?"
29The king said to him, "Why say more?
I order you and Ziba to divide the fields."
30Mephibosheth said to the king, "Let
him take everything, now that my lord
the king has arrived home safely."
31Barzillai the Gileadite also came down
from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with
the king and to send him on his way
from there.
32Now Barzillai was a very old man,
eighty years of age. He had provided for
the king during his stay in Mahanaim, for
he was a very wealthy man.
33The king said to Barzillai, "Cross over
with me and stay with me in Jerusalem,
and I will provide for you."
34But Barzillai answered the king, "How
many more years will I live, that I should
go up to Jerusalem with the king?
35I am now eighty years old. Can I tell
the difference between what is good and
what is not? Can your servant taste
what he eats and drinks? Can I still hear
the voices of men and women singers?
Why should your servant be an added
burden to my lord the king?
36Your servant will cross over the Jordan
with the king for a short distance, but
why should the king reward me in this
way?
37Let your servant return, that I may die
in my own town near the tomb of my
father and mother. But here is your
servant Kimham. Let him cross over
with my lord the king. Do for him
whatever pleases you."
38The king said, "Kimham shall cross
over with me, and I will do for him
whatever pleases you. And anything you
desire from me I will do for you."
39So all the people crossed the Jordan,
and then the king crossed over. The
king kissed Barzillai and gave him his
blessing, and Barzillai returned to his
home.
40When the king crossed over to Gilgal,
Kimham crossed with him. All the troops
of Judah and half the troops of Israel
had taken the king over.
41Soon all the men of Israel were
coming to the king and saying to him,
"Why did our brothers, the men of Judah,
steal the king away and bring him and
his household across the Jordan,
together with all his men?"
42All the men of Judah answered the
men of Israel, "We did this because the
king is closely related to us. Why are
you angry about it? Have we eaten any
of the king's provisions? Have we taken
anything for ourselves?"
43Then the men of Israel answered the
men of Judah, "We have ten shares in
the king; and besides, we have a
greater claim on David than you have.
So why do you treat us with contempt?
Were we not the first to speak of
bringing back our king?" But the men of
Judah responded even more harshly
than the men of Israel.
20Now a troublemaker named
Sheba son of Bicri, a Benjamite,
happened to be there. He sounded the
trumpet and shouted, "We have no
share in David, no part in Jesse's son!
Every man to his tent, O Israel!"
2So all the men of Israel deserted David
to follow Sheba son of Bicri. But the
men of Judah stayed by their king all the
way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
3When David returned to his palace in
Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines
he had left to take care of the palace
and put them in a house under guard.
He provided for them, but did not lie with
them. They were kept in confinement till
the day of their death, living as widows.
4Then the king said to Amasa, "Summon
the men of Judah to come to me within
three days, and be here yourself."
5But when Amasa went to summon
Judah, he took longer than the time the
king had set for him.
6David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba son
of Bicri will do us more harm than
Absalom did. Take your master's men
and pursue him, or he will find fortified
cities and escape from us."
7So Joab's men and the Kerethites and
Pelethites and all the mighty warriors
went out under the command of Abishai.
They marched out from Jerusalem to
pursue Sheba son of Bicri.
8While they were at the great rock in
Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them.
Joab was wearing his military tunic, and
strapped over it at his waist was a belt
with a dagger in its sheath. As he
stepped forward, it dropped out of its
sheath.
9Joab said to Amasa, "How are you, my
brother?" Then Joab took Amasa by the
beard with his right hand to kiss him.
10Amasa was not on his guard against
the dagger in Joab's hand, and Joab
plunged it into his belly, and his
intestines spilled out on the ground.
Without being stabbed again, Amasa
died. Then Joab and his brother Abishai
pursued Sheba son of Bicri.
11One of Joab's men stood beside
Amasa and said, "Whoever favors Joab,
and whoever is for David, let him follow
Joab!"
12Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in
the middle of the road, and the man saw
that all the troops came to a halt there.
When he realized that everyone who
came up to Amasa stopped, he dragged
him from the road into a field and threw
a garment over him.
13After Amasa had been removed from
the road, all the men went on with Joab
to pursue Sheba son of Bicri.
14Sheba passed through all the tribes of
Israel to Abel Beth Maacah and through
the entire region of the Berites, who
gathered together and followed him.
15All the troops with Joab came and
besieged Sheba in Abel Beth Maacah.
They built a siege ramp up to the city,
and it stood against the outer
fortifications. While they were battering
the wall to bring it down,
16a wise woman called from the city,
"Listen! Listen! Tell Joab to come here
so I can speak to him."
17He went toward her, and she asked,
"Are you Joab?" "I am," he answered.
She said, "Listen to what your servant
has to say." "I'm listening," he said.
18She continued, "Long ago they used to
say, 'Get your answer at Abel,' and that
settled it.
19We are the peaceful and faithful in
Israel. You are trying to destroy a city
that is a mother in Israel. Why do you
want to swallow up the Lord 's
inheritance?"
20"Far be it from me!" Joab replied, "Far
be it from me to swallow up or destroy!
21That is not the case. A man named
Sheba son of Bicri, from the hill country
of Ephraim, has lifted up his hand
against the king, against David. Hand
over this one man, and I'll withdraw from
the city." The woman said to Joab, "His
head will be thrown to you from the
wall."
22Then the woman went to all the people
with her wise advice, and they cut off
the head of Sheba son of Bicri and
threw it to Joab. So he sounded the
trumpet, and his men dispersed from the
city, each returning to his home. And
Joab went back to the king in Jerusalem.
23Joab was over Israel's entire army;
Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the
Kerethites and Pelethites;
24Adoniram was in charge of forced
labor; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was
recorder;
25Sheva was secretary; Zadok and
Abiathar were priests;
26and Ira the Jairite was David's priest.
21During the reign of David, there
was a famine for three successive
years; so David sought the face of the
Lord . The Lord said, "It is on account of
Saul and his blood-stained house; it is
because he put the Gibeonites to
death."
2The king summoned the Gibeonites
and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites
were not a part of Israel but were
survivors of the Amorites; the Israelites
had sworn to spare them, but Saul in his
zeal for Israel and Judah had tried to
annihilate them.)
3David asked the Gibeonites, "What
shall I do for you? How shall I make
amends so that you will bless the Lord 's
inheritance?"
4The Gibeonites answered him, "We
have no right to demand silver or gold
from Saul or his family, nor do we have
the right to put anyone in Israel to
death." "What do you want me to do for
you?" David asked.
5They answered the king, "As for the
man who destroyed us and plotted
against us so that we have been
decimated and have no place anywhere
in Israel,
6let seven of his male descendants be
given to us to be killed and exposed
before the Lord at Gibeah of Saul-the
Lord 's chosen one." So the king said, "I
will give them to you."
7The king spared Mephibosheth son of
Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of
the oath before the Lord between David
and Jonathan son of Saul.
8But the king took Armoni and
Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah's
daughter Rizpah, whom she had borne
to Saul, together with the five sons of
Saul's daughter Merab, whom she had
borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the
Meholathite.
9He handed them over to the Gibeonites,
who killed and exposed them on a hill
before the Lord . All seven of them fell
together; they were put to death during
the first days of the harvest, just as the
barley harvest was beginning.
10Rizpah daughter of Aiah took
sackcloth and spread it out for herself
on a rock. From the beginning of the
harvest till the rain poured down from
the heavens on the bodies, she did not
let the birds of the air touch them by day
or the wild animals by night.
11When David was told what Aiah's
daughter Rizpah, Saul's concubine, had
done,
12he went and took the bones of Saul
and his son Jonathan from the citizens
of Jabesh Gilead. (They had taken them
secretly from the public square at Beth
Shan, where the Philistines had hung
them after they struck Saul down on
Gilboa.)
13David brought the bones of Saul and
his son Jonathan from there, and the
bones of those who had been killed and
exposed were gathered up.
14They buried the bones of Saul and his
son Jonathan in the tomb of Saul's
father Kish, at Zela in Benjamin, and did
everything the king commanded. After
that, God answered prayer in behalf of
the land.
15Once again there was a battle
between the Philistines and Israel.
David went down with his men to fight
against the Philistines, and he became
exhausted.
16And Ishbi-Benob, one of the
descendants of Rapha, whose bronze
spearhead weighed three hundred
shekels and who was armed with a new
sword , said he would kill David.
17But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to
David's rescue; he struck the Philistine
down and killed him. Then David's men
swore to him, saying, "Never again will
you go out with us to battle, so that the
lamp of Israel will not be extinguished."
18In the course of time, there was
another battle with the Philistines, at
Gob. At that time Sibbecai the
Hushathite killed Saph, one of the
descendants of Rapha.
19In another battle with the Philistines at
Gob, Elhanan son of Jaare-Oregim the
Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite,
who had a spear with a shaft like a
weaver's rod.
20In still another battle, which took place
at Gath, there was a huge man with six
fingers on each hand and six toes on
each foot-twenty-four in all. He also was
descended from Rapha.
21When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son
of Shimeah, David's brother, killed him.
22These four were descendants of
Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the
hands of David and his men.
22David sang to the Lord the words
of this song when the Lord delivered him
from the hand of all his enemies and
from the hand of Saul.
2He said: "The Lord is my rock, my
fortress and my deliverer;
3my God is my rock, in whom I take
refuge, my shield and the horn of my
salvation. He is my stronghold, my
refuge and my savior- from violent men
you save me.
4I call to the Lord , who is worthy of
praise, and I am saved from my
enemies.
5"The waves of death swirled about me;
the torrents of destruction overwhelmed
me.
6The cords of the grave coiled around
me; the snares of death confronted me.
7In my distress I called to the Lord ; I
called out to my God. From his temple
he heard my voice; my cry came to his
ears.
8"The earth trembled and quaked, the
foundations of the heavens shook; they
trembled because he was angry.
9Smoke rose from his nostrils;
consuming fire came from his mouth,
burning coals blazed out of it.
10He parted the heavens and came
down; dark clouds were under his feet.
11He mounted the cherubim and flew; he
soared on the wings of the wind.
12He made darkness his canopy around
him- the dark rain clouds of the sky.
13Out of the brightness of his presence
bolts of lightning blazed forth.
14The Lord thundered from heaven; the
voice of the Most High resounded.
15He shot arrows and scattered the
enemies , bolts of lightning and routed
them.
16The valleys of the sea were exposed
and the foundations of the earth laid
bare at the rebuke of the Lord , at the
blast of breath from his nostrils.
17"He reached down from on high and
took hold of me; he drew me out of deep
waters.
18He rescued me from my powerful
enemy, from my foes, who were too
strong for me.
19They confronted me in the day of my
disaster, but the Lord was my support.
20He brought me out into a spacious
place; he rescued me because he
delighted in me.
21"The Lord has dealt with me according
to my righteousness; according to the
cleanness of my hands he has rewarded
me.
22For I have kept the ways of the Lord ; I
have not done evil by turning from my
God.
23All his laws are before me; I have not
turned away from his decrees.
24I have been blameless before him and
have kept myself from sin.
25The Lord has rewarded me according
to my righteousness, according to my
cleanness in his sight.
26"To the faithful you show yourself
faithful, to the blameless you show
yourself blameless,
27to the pure you show yourself pure,
but to the crooked you show yourself
shrewd.
28You save the humble, but your eyes
are on the haughty to bring them low.
29You are my lamp, O Lord ; the Lord
turns my darkness into light.
30With your help I can advance against a
troop ; with my God I can scale a wall.
31"As for God, his way is perfect; the
word of the Lord is flawless. He is a
shield for all who take refuge in him.
32For who is God besides the Lord ?
And who is the Rock except our God?
33It is God who arms me with strength
and makes my way perfect.
34He makes my feet like the feet of a
deer; he enables me to stand on the
heights.
35He trains my hands for battle; my arms
can bend a bow of bronze.
36You give me your shield of victory; you
stoop down to make me great.
37You broaden the path beneath me, so
that my ankles do not turn.
38"I pursued my enemies and crushed
them; I did not turn back till they were
destroyed.
39I crushed them completely, and they
could not rise; they fell beneath my feet.
40You armed me with strength for battle;
you made my adversaries bow at my
feet.
41You made my enemies turn their
backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes.
42They cried for help, but there was no
one to save them- to the Lord , but he
did not answer.
43I beat them as fine as the dust of the
earth; I pounded and trampled them like
mud in the streets.
44"You have delivered me from the
attacks of my people; you have
preserved me as the head of nations.
People I did not know are subject to me,
45and foreigners come cringing to me;
as soon as they hear me, they obey me.
46They all lose heart; they come
trembling from their strongholds.
47"The Lord lives! Praise be to my Rock!
Exalted be God, the Rock, my Savior!
48He is the God who avenges me, who
puts the nations under me,
49who sets me free from my enemies.
You exalted me above my foes; from
violent men you rescued me.
50Therefore I will praise you, O Lord ,
among the nations; I will sing praises to
your name.
51He gives his king great victories; he
shows unfailing kindness to his anointed,
to David and his descendants forever."
23These are the last words of David:
"The oracle of David son of Jesse, the
oracle of the man exalted by the Most
High, the man anointed by the God of
Jacob, Israel's singer of songs :
2"The Spirit of the Lord spoke through
me; his word was on my tongue.
3The God of Israel spoke, the Rock of
Israel said to me: 'When one rules over
men in righteousness, when he rules in
the fear of God,
4he is like the light of morning at sunrise
on a cloudless morning, like the
brightness after rain that brings the
grass from the earth.'
5"Is not my house right with God? Has
he not made with me an everlasting
covenant, arranged and secured in
every part? Will he not bring to fruition
my salvation and grant me my every
desire?
6But evil men are all to be cast aside like
thorns, which are not gathered with the
hand.
7Whoever touches thorns uses a tool of
iron or the shaft of a spear; they are
burned up where they lie."
8These are the names of David's mighty
men: Josheb-Basshebeth, a
Tahkemonite, was chief of the Three; he
raised his spear against eight hundred
men, whom he killed in one encounter.
9Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai
the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty
men, he was with David when they
taunted the Philistines gathered at Pas
Dammim for battle. Then the men of
Israel retreated,
10but he stood his ground and struck
down the Philistines till his hand grew
tired and froze to the sword. The Lord
brought about a great victory that day.
The troops returned to Eleazar, but only
to strip the dead.
11Next to him was Shammah son of
Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines
banded together at a place where there
was a field full of lentils, Israel's troops
fled from them.
12But Shammah took his stand in the
middle of the field. He defended it and
struck the Philistines down, and the Lord
brought about a great victory.
13During harvest time, three of the thirty
chief men came down to David at the
cave of Adullam, while a band of
Philistines was encamped in the Valley
of Rephaim.
14At that time David was in the
stronghold, and the Philistine garrison
was at Bethlehem.
15David longed for water and said, "Oh,
that someone would get me a drink of
water from the well near the gate of
Bethlehem!"
16So the three mighty men broke
through the Philistine lines, drew water
from the well near the gate of
Bethlehem and carried it back to David.
But he refused to drink it; instead, he
poured it out before the Lord .
17"Far be it from me, O Lord , to do this!"
he said. "Is it not the blood of men who
went at the risk of their lives?" And
David would not drink it. Such were the
exploits of the three mighty men.
18Abishai the brother of Joab son of
Zeruiah was chief of the Three. He
raised his spear against three hundred
men, whom he killed, and so he became
as famous as the Three.
19Was he not held in greater honor than
the Three? He became their
commander, even though he was not
included among them.
20Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant
fighter from Kabzeel, who performed
great exploits. He struck down two of
Moab's best men. He also went down
into a pit on a snowy day and killed a
lion.
21And he struck down a huge Egyptian.
Although the Egyptian had a spear in his
hand, Benaiah went against him with a
club. He snatched the spear from the
Egyptian's hand and killed him with his
own spear.
22Such were the exploits of Benaiah son
of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as
the three mighty men.
23He was held in greater honor than any
of the Thirty, but he was not included
among the Three. And David put him in
charge of his bodyguard.
24Among the Thirty were: Asahel the
brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo
from Bethlehem,
25Shammah the Harodite, Elika the
Harodite,
26Helez the Paltite, Ira son of Ikkesh
from Tekoa,
27Abiezer from Anathoth, Mebunnai the
Hushathite,
28Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the
Netophathite,
29Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite,
Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah in
Benjamin,
30Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai from
the ravines of Gaash,
31Abi-Albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the
Barhumite,
32Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of
Jashen, Jonathan
33son of Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam
son of Sharar the Hararite,
34Eliphelet son of Ahasbai the
Maacathite, Eliam son of Ahithophel the
Gilonite,
35Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
36Igal son of Nathan from Zobah, the
son of Hagri,
37Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the
Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab
son of Zeruiah,
38Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite
39and Uriah the Hittite. There were thirtyseven
in all.
24Again the anger of the Lord
burned against Israel, and he incited
David against them, saying, "Go and
take a census of Israel and Judah."
2So the king said to Joab and the army
commanders with him, "Go throughout
the tribes of Israel from Dan to
Beersheba and enroll the fighting men,
so that I may know how many there
are."
3But Joab replied to the king, "May the
Lord your God multiply the troops a
hundred times over, and may the eyes
of my lord the king see it. But why does
my lord the king want to do such a
thing?"
4The king's word, however, overruled
Joab and the army commanders; so
they left the presence of the king to
enroll the fighting men of Israel.
5After crossing the Jordan, they camped
near Aroer, south of the town in the
gorge, and then went through Gad and
on to Jazer.
6They went to Gilead and the region of
Tahtim Hodshi, and on to Dan Jaan and
around toward Sidon.
7Then they went toward the fortress of
Tyre and all the towns of the Hivites and
Canaanites. Finally, they went on to
Beersheba in the Negev of Judah.
8After they had gone through the entire
land, they came back to Jerusalem at
the end of nine months and twenty days.
9Joab reported the number of the
fighting men to the king: In Israel there
were eight hundred thousand ablebodied
men who could handle a sword,
and in Judah five hundred thousand.
10David was conscience-stricken after
he had counted the fighting men, and he
said to the Lord , "I have sinned greatly
in what I have done. Now, O Lord , I beg
you, take away the guilt of your servant.
I have done a very foolish thing."
11Before David got up the next morning,
the word of the Lord had come to Gad
the prophet, David's seer:
12"Go and tell David, 'This is what the
Lord says: I am giving you three options.
Choose one of them for me to carry out
against you.' "
13So Gad went to David and said to him,
"Shall there come upon you three years
of famine in your land? Or three months
of fleeing from your enemies while they
pursue you? Or three days of plague in
your land? Now then, think it over and
decide how I should answer the one
who sent me."
14David said to Gad, "I am in deep
distress. Let us fall into the hands of the
Lord , for his mercy is great; but do not
let me fall into the hands of men."
15So the Lord sent a plague on Israel
from that morning until the end of the
time designated, and seventy thousand
of the people from Dan to Beersheba
died.
16When the angel stretched out his hand
to destroy Jerusalem, the Lord was
grieved because of the calamity and
said to the angel who was afflicting the
people, "Enough! Withdraw your hand."
The angel of the Lord was then at the
threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
17When David saw the angel who was
striking down the people, he said to the
Lord , "I am the one who has sinned and
done wrong. These are but sheep. What
have they done? Let your hand fall upon
me and my family."
18On that day Gad went to David and
said to him, "Go up and build an altar to
the Lord on the threshing floor of
Araunah the Jebusite."
19So David went up, as the Lord had
commanded through Gad.
20When Araunah looked and saw the
king and his men coming toward him, he
went out and bowed down before the
king with his face to the ground.
21Araunah said, "Why has my lord the
king come to his servant?" "To buy your
threshing floor," David answered, "so I
can build an altar to the Lord , that the
plague on the people may be stopped."
22Araunah said to David, "Let my lord
the king take whatever pleases him and
offer it up. Here are oxen for the burnt
offering, and here are threshing sledges
and ox yokes for the wood.
23O king, Araunah gives all this to the
king." Araunah also said to him, "May
the Lord your God accept you."
24But the king replied to Araunah, "No, I
insist on paying you for it. I will not
sacrifice to the Lord my God burnt
offerings that cost me nothing." So
David bought the threshing floor and the
oxen and paid fifty shekels of silver for
them.
25David built an altar to the Lord there
and sacrificed burnt offerings and
fellowship offerings. Then the Lord
answered prayer in behalf of the land,
and the plague on Israel was stopped.
1st Kings
1When King David was old and well
advanced in years, he could not keep
warm even when they put covers over
him.
2So his servants said to him, "Let us
look for a young virgin to attend the king
and take care of him. She can lie beside
him so that our lord the king may keep
warm."
3Then they searched throughout Israel
for a beautiful girl and found Abishag, a
Shunammite, and brought her to the
king.
4The girl was very beautiful; she took
care of the king and waited on him, but
the king had no intimate relations with
her.
5Now Adonijah, whose mother was
Haggith, put himself forward and said, "I
will be king." So he got chariots and
horses ready, with fifty men to run
ahead of him.
6(His father had never interfered with
him by asking, "Why do you behave as
you do?" He was also very handsome
and was born next after Absalom.)
7Adonijah conferred with Joab son of
Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest,
and they gave him their support.
8But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of
Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei
and Rei and David's special guard did
not join Adonijah.
9Adonijah then sacrificed sheep, cattle
and fattened calves at the Stone of
Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all
his brothers, the king's sons, and all the
men of Judah who were royal officials,
10but he did not invite Nathan the
prophet or Benaiah or the special guard
or his brother Solomon.
11Then Nathan asked Bathsheba,
Solomon's mother, "Have you not heard
that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has
become king without our lord David's
knowing it?
12Now then, let me advise you how you
can save your own life and the life of
your son Solomon.
13Go in to King David and say to him,
'My lord the king, did you not swear to
me your servant: "Surely Solomon your
son shall be king after me, and he will sit
on my throne"? Why then has Adonijah
become king?'
14While you are still there talking to the
king, I will come in and confirm what you
have said."
15So Bathsheba went to see the aged
king in his room, where Abishag the
Shunammite was attending him.
16Bathsheba bowed low and knelt before
the king. "What is it you want?" the king
asked.
17She said to him, "My lord, you yourself
swore to me your servant by the Lord
your God: 'Solomon your son shall be
king after me, and he will sit on my
throne.'
18But now Adonijah has become king,
and you, my lord the king, do not know
about it.
19He has sacrificed great numbers of
cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and
has invited all the king's sons, Abiathar
the priest and Joab the commander of
the army, but he has not invited
Solomon your servant.
20My lord the king, the eyes of all Israel
are on you, to learn from you who will sit
on the throne of my lord the king after
him.
21Otherwise, as soon as my lord the king
is laid to rest with his fathers, I and my
son Solomon will be treated as
criminals."
22While she was still speaking with the
king, Nathan the prophet arrived.
23And they told the king, "Nathan the
prophet is here." So he went before the
king and bowed with his face to the
ground.
24Nathan said, "Have you, my lord the
king, declared that Adonijah shall be
king after you, and that he will sit on
your throne?
25Today he has gone down and
sacrificed great numbers of cattle,
fattened calves, and sheep. He has
invited all the king's sons, the
commanders of the army and Abiathar
the priest. Right now they are eating and
drinking with him and saying, 'Long live
King Adonijah!'
26But me your servant, and Zadok the
priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada,
and your servant Solomon he did not
invite.
27Is this something my lord the king has
done without letting his servants know
who should sit on the throne of my lord
the king after him?"
28Then King David said, "Call in
Bathsheba." So she came into the king's
presence and stood before him.
29The king then took an oath: "As surely
as the Lord lives, who has delivered me
out of every trouble,
30I will surely carry out today what I
swore to you by the Lord , the God of
Israel: Solomon your son shall be king
after me, and he will sit on my throne in
my place."
31Then Bathsheba bowed low with her
face to the ground and, kneeling before
the king, said, "May my lord King David
live forever!"
32King David said, "Call in Zadok the
priest, Nathan the prophet and Benaiah
son of Jehoiada." When they came
before the king,
33he said to them: "Take your lord's
servants with you and set Solomon my
son on my own mule and take him down
to Gihon.
34There have Zadok the priest and
Nathan the prophet anoint him king over
Israel. Blow the trumpet and shout,
'Long live King Solomon!'
35Then you are to go up with him, and
he is to come and sit on my throne and
reign in my place. I have appointed him
ruler over Israel and Judah."
36Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered
the king, "Amen! May the Lord , the God
of my lord the king, so declare it.
37As the Lord was with my lord the king,
so may he be with Solomon to make his
throne even greater than the throne of
my lord King David!"
38So Zadok the priest, Nathan the
prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the
Kerethites and the Pelethites went down
and put Solomon on King David's mule
and escorted him to Gihon.
39Zadok the priest took the horn of oil
from the sacred tent and anointed
Solomon. Then they sounded the
trumpet and all the people shouted,
"Long live King Solomon!"
40And all the people went up after him,
playing flutes and rejoicing greatly, so
that the ground shook with the sound.
41Adonijah and all the guests who were
with him heard it as they were finishing
their feast. On hearing the sound of the
trumpet, Joab asked, "What's the
meaning of all the noise in the city?"
42Even as he was speaking, Jonathan
son of Abiathar the priest arrived.
Adonijah said, "Come in. A worthy man
like you must be bringing good news."
43"Not at all!" Jonathan answered. "Our
lord King David has made Solomon king.
44The king has sent with him Zadok the
priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son
of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the
Pelethites, and they have put him on the
king's mule,
45and Zadok the priest and Nathan the
prophet have anointed him king at
Gihon. From there they have gone up
cheering, and the city resounds with it.
That's the noise you hear.
46Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat
on the royal throne.
47Also, the royal officials have come to
congratulate our lord King David, saying,
'May your God make Solomon's name
more famous than yours and his throne
greater than yours!' And the king bowed
in worship on his bed
48and said, 'Praise be to the Lord , the
God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes
to see a successor on my throne today.'
"
49At this, all Adonijah's guests rose in
alarm and dispersed.
50But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, went
and took hold of the horns of the altar.
51Then Solomon was told, "Adonijah is
afraid of King Solomon and is clinging to
the horns of the altar. He says, 'Let King
Solomon swear to me today that he will
not put his servant to death with the
sword.' "
52Solomon replied, "If he shows himself
to be a worthy man, not a hair of his
head will fall to the ground; but if evil is
found in him, he will die."
53Then King Solomon sent men, and
they brought him down from the altar.
And Adonijah came and bowed down to
King Solomon, and Solomon said, "Go
to your home."
2When the time drew near for David to
die, he gave a charge to Solomon his
son.
2"I am about to go the way of all the
earth," he said. "So be strong, show
yourself a man,
3and observe what the Lord your God
requires: Walk in his ways, and keep his
decrees and commands, his laws and
requirements, as written in the Law of
Moses, so that you may prosper in all
you do and wherever you go,
4and that the Lord may keep his promise
to me: 'If your descendants watch how
they live, and if they walk faithfully
before me with all their heart and soul,
you will never fail to have a man on the
throne of Israel.'
5"Now you yourself know what Joab son
of Zeruiah did to me-what he did to the
two commanders of Israel's armies,
Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of
Jether. He killed them, shedding their
blood in peacetime as if in battle, and
with that blood stained the belt around
his waist and the sandals on his feet.
6Deal with him according to your wisdom,
but do not let his gray head go down to
the grave in peace.
7"But show kindness to the sons of
Barzillai of Gilead and let them be
among those who eat at your table.
They stood by me when I fled from your
brother Absalom.
8"And remember, you have with you
Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from
Bahurim, who called down bitter curses
on me the day I went to Mahanaim.
When he came down to meet me at the
Jordan, I swore to him by the Lord : 'I
will not put you to death by the sword.'
9But now, do not consider him innocent.
You are a man of wisdom; you will know
what to do to him. Bring his gray head
down to the grave in blood."
10Then David rested with his fathers and
was buried in the City of David.
11He had reigned forty years over Israelseven
years in Hebron and thirty-three
in Jerusalem.
12So Solomon sat on the throne of his
father David, and his rule was firmly
established.
13Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith,
went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother.
Bathsheba asked him, "Do you come
peacefully?" He answered, "Yes,
peacefully."
14Then he added, "I have something to
say to you." "You may say it," she
replied.
15"As you know," he said, "the kingdom
was mine. All Israel looked to me as
their king. But things changed, and the
kingdom has gone to my brother; for it
has come to him from the Lord .
16Now I have one request to make of
you. Do not refuse me." "You may make
it," she said.
17So he continued, "Please ask King
Solomon-he will not refuse you-to give
me Abishag the Shunammite as my
wife."
18"Very well," Bathsheba replied, "I will
speak to the king for you."
19When Bathsheba went to King
Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah,
the king stood up to meet her, bowed
down to her and sat down on his throne.
He had a throne brought for the king's
mother, and she sat down at his right
hand.
20"I have one small request to make of
you," she said. "Do not refuse me." The
king replied, "Make it, my mother; I will
not refuse you."
21So she said, "Let Abishag the
Shunammite be given in marriage to
your brother Adonijah."
22King Solomon answered his mother,
"Why do you request Abishag the
Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as
well request the kingdom for him-after
all, he is my older brother-yes, for him
and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son
of Zeruiah!"
23Then King Solomon swore by the
Lord : "May God deal with me, be it ever
so severely, if Adonijah does not pay
with his life for this request!
24And now, as surely as the Lord liveshe
who has established me securely on
the throne of my father David and has
founded a dynasty for me as he
promised-Adonijah shall be put to death
today!"
25So King Solomon gave orders to
Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck
down Adonijah and he died.
26To Abiathar the priest the king said,
"Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You
deserve to die, but I will not put you to
death now, because you carried the ark
of the Sovereign Lord before my father
David and shared all my father's
hardships."
27So Solomon removed Abiathar from
the priesthood of the Lord , fulfilling the
word the Lord had spoken at Shiloh
about the house of Eli.
28When the news reached Joab, who
had conspired with Adonijah though not
with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the
Lord and took hold of the horns of the
altar.
29King Solomon was told that Joab had
fled to the tent of the Lord and was
beside the altar. Then Solomon ordered
Benaiah son of Jehoiada, "Go, strike
him down!"
30So Benaiah entered the tent of the
Lord and said to Joab, "The king says,
'Come out!' " But he answered, "No, I
will die here." Benaiah reported to the
king, "This is how Joab answered me."
31Then the king commanded Benaiah,
"Do as he says. Strike him down and
bury him, and so clear me and my
father's house of the guilt of the innocent
blood that Joab shed.
32The Lord will repay him for the blood
he shed, because without the
knowledge of my father David he
attacked two men and killed them with
the sword. Both of them-Abner son of
Ner, commander of Israel's army, and
Amasa son of Jether, commander of
Judah's army-were better men and more
upright than he.
33May the guilt of their blood rest on the
head of Joab and his descendants
forever. But on David and his
descendants, his house and his throne,
may there be the Lord 's peace forever."
34So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up
and struck down Joab and killed him,
and he was buried on his own land in
the desert.
35The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada
over the army in Joab's position and
replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest.
36Then the king sent for Shimei and said
to him, "Build yourself a house in
Jerusalem and live there, but do not go
anywhere else.
37The day you leave and cross the
Kidron Valley, you can be sure you will
die; your blood will be on your own
head."
38Shimei answered the king, "What you
say is good. Your servant will do as my
lord the king has said." And Shimei
stayed in Jerusalem for a long time.
39But three years later, two of Shimei's
slaves ran off to Achish son of Maacah,
king of Gath, and Shimei was told, "Your
slaves are in Gath."
40At this, he saddled his donkey and
went to Achish at Gath in search of his
slaves. So Shimei went away and
brought the slaves back from Gath.
41When Solomon was told that Shimei
had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and
had returned,
42the king summoned Shimei and said to
him, "Did I not make you swear by the
Lord and warn you, 'On the day you
leave to go anywhere else, you can be
sure you will die'? At that time you said
to me, 'What you say is good. I will
obey.'
43Why then did you not keep your oath
to the Lord and obey the command I
gave you?"
44The king also said to Shimei, "You
know in your heart all the wrong you did
to my father David. Now the Lord will
repay you for your wrongdoing.
45But King Solomon will be blessed, and
David's throne will remain secure before
the Lord forever."
46Then the king gave the order to
Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went
out and struck Shimei down and killed
him. The kingdom was now firmly
established in Solomon's hands.
3Solomon made an alliance with
Pharaoh king of Egypt and married his
daughter. He brought her to the City of
David until he finished building his
palace and the temple of the Lord , and
the wall around Jerusalem.
2The people, however, were still
sacrificing at the high places, because a
temple had not yet been built for the
Name of the Lord .
3Solomon showed his love for the Lord
by walking according to the statutes of
his father David, except that he offered
sacrifices and burned incense on the
high places.
4The king went to Gibeon to offer
sacrifices, for that was the most
important high place, and Solomon
offered a thousand burnt offerings on
that altar.
5At Gibeon the Lord appeared to
Solomon during the night in a dream,
and God said, "Ask for whatever you
want me to give you."
6Solomon answered, "You have shown
great kindness to your servant, my
father David, because he was faithful to
you and righteous and upright in heart.
You have continued this great kindness
to him and have given him a son to sit
on his throne this very day.
7"Now, O Lord my God, you have made
your servant king in place of my father
David. But I am only a little child and do
not know how to carry out my duties.
8Your servant is here among the people
you have chosen, a great people, too
numerous to count or number.
9So give your servant a discerning heart
to govern your people and to distinguish
between right and wrong. For who is
able to govern this great people of
yours?"
10The Lord was pleased that Solomon
had asked for this.
11So God said to him, "Since you have
asked for this and not for long life or
wealth for yourself, nor have asked for
the death of your enemies but for
discernment in administering justice,
12I will do what you have asked. I will
give you a wise and discerning heart, so
that there will never have been anyone
like you, nor will there ever be.
13Moreover, I will give you what you
have not asked for-both riches and
honor-so that in your lifetime you will
have no equal among kings.
14And if you walk in my ways and obey
my statutes and commands as David
your father did, I will give you a long
life."
15Then Solomon awoke-and he realized
it had been a dream. He returned to
Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the
Lord's covenant and sacrificed burnt
offerings and fellowship offerings. Then
he gave a feast for all his court.
16Now two prostitutes came to the king
and stood before him.
17One of them said, "My lord, this
woman and I live in the same house. I
had a baby while she was there with me.
18The third day after my child was born,
this woman also had a baby. We were
alone; there was no one in the house
but the two of us.
19"During the night this woman's son
died because she lay on him.
20So she got up in the middle of the
night and took my son from my side
while I your servant was asleep. She put
him by her breast and put her dead son
by my breast.
21The next morning, I got up to nurse my
son-and he was dead! But when I
looked at him closely in the morning
light, I saw that it wasn't the son I had
borne."
22The other woman said, "No! The living
one is my son; the dead one is yours."
But the first one insisted, "No! The dead
one is yours; the living one is mine." And
so they argued before the king.
23The king said, "This one says, 'My son
is alive and your son is dead,' while that
one says, 'No! Your son is dead and
mine is alive.' "
24Then the king said, "Bring me a
sword." So they brought a sword for the
king.
25He then gave an order: "Cut the living
child in two and give half to one and half
to the other."
26The woman whose son was alive was
filled with compassion for her son and
said to the king, "Please, my lord, give
her the living baby! Don't kill him!" But
the other said, "Neither I nor you shall
have him. Cut him in two!"
27Then the king gave his ruling: "Give
the living baby to the first woman. Do
not kill him; she is his mother."
28When all Israel heard the verdict the
king had given, they held the king in
awe, because they saw that he had
wisdom from God to administer justice.
4So King Solomon ruled over all Israel.
2And these were his chief officials:
Azariah son of Zadok-the priest;
3Elihoreph and Ahijah, sons of Shishasecretaries;
Jehoshaphat son of Ahiludrecorder;
4Benaiah son of Jehoiada-commander
in chief; Zadok and Abiathar-priests;
5Azariah son of Nathan-in charge of the
district officers; Zabud son of Nathan-a
priest and personal adviser to the king;
6Ahishar-in charge of the palace;
Adoniram son of Abda-in charge of
forced labor.
7Solomon also had twelve district
governors over all Israel, who supplied
provisions for the king and the royal
household. Each one had to provide
supplies for one month in the year.
8These are their names: Ben-Hur-in the
hill country of Ephraim;
9Ben-Deker-in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth
Shemesh and Elon Bethhanan;
10Ben-Hesed-in Arubboth (Socoh and all
the land of Hepher were his);
11Ben-Abinadab-in Naphoth Dor (he was
married to Taphath daughter of
Solomon);
12Baana son of Ahilud-in Taanach and
Megiddo, and in all of Beth Shan next to
Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth Shan
to Abel Meholah across to Jokmeam;
13Ben-Geber-in Ramoth Gilead (the
settlements of Jair son of Manasseh in
Gilead were his, as well as the district of
Argob in Bashan and its sixty large
walled cities with bronze gate bars);
14Ahinadab son of Iddo-in Mahanaim;
15Ahimaaz-in Naphtali (he had married
Basemath daughter of Solomon);
16Baana son of Hushai-in Asher and in
Aloth;
17Jehoshaphat son of Paruah-in
Issachar;
18Shimei son of Ela-in Benjamin;
19Geber son of Uri-in Gilead (the country
of Sihon king of the Amorites and the
country of Og king of Bashan). He was
the only governor over the district.
20The people of Judah and Israel were
as numerous as the sand on the
seashore; they ate, they drank and they
were happy.
21And Solomon ruled over all the
kingdoms from the River to the land of
the Philistines, as far as the border of
Egypt. These countries brought tribute
and were Solomon's subjects all his life.
22Solomon's daily provisions were thirty
cors of fine flour and sixty cors of meal,
23ten head of stall-fed cattle, twenty of
pasture-fed cattle and a hundred sheep
and goats, as well as deer, gazelles,
roebucks and choice fowl.
24For he ruled over all the kingdoms
west of the River, from Tiphsah to Gaza,
and had peace on all sides.
25During Solomon's lifetime Judah and
Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, lived in
safety, each man under his own vine
and fig tree.
26Solomon had four thousand stalls for
chariot horses, and twelve thousand
horses.
27The district officers, each in his month,
supplied provisions for King Solomon
and all who came to the king's table.
They saw to it that nothing was lacking.
28They also brought to the proper place
their quotas of barley and straw for the
chariot horses and the other horses.
29God gave Solomon wisdom and very
great insight, and a breadth of
understanding as measureless as the
sand on the seashore.
30Solomon's wisdom was greater than
the wisdom of all the men of the East,
and greater than all the wisdom of Egypt.
31He was wiser than any other man,
including Ethan the Ezrahite-wiser than
Heman, Calcol and Darda, the sons of
Mahol. And his fame spread to all the
surrounding nations.
32He spoke three thousand proverbs
and his songs numbered a thousand
and five.
33He described plant life, from the cedar
of Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out
of walls. He also taught about animals
and birds, reptiles and fish.
34Men of all nations came to listen to
Solomon's wisdom, sent by all the kings
of the world, who had heard of his
wisdom.
5When Hiram king of Tyre heard that
Solomon had been anointed king to
succeed his father David, he sent his
envoys to Solomon, because he had
always been on friendly terms with
David.
2Solomon sent back this message to
Hiram:
3"You know that because of the wars
waged against my father David from all
sides, he could not build a temple for the
Name of the Lord his God until the Lord
put his enemies under his feet.
4But now the Lord my God has given me
rest on every side, and there is no
adversary or disaster.
5I intend, therefore, to build a temple for
the Name of the Lord my God, as the
Lord told my father David, when he said,
'Your son whom I will put on the throne
in your place will build the temple for my
Name.'
6"So give orders that cedars of Lebanon
be cut for me. My men will work with
yours, and I will pay you for your men
whatever wages you set. You know that
we have no one so skilled in felling
timber as the Sidonians."
7When Hiram heard Solomon's
message, he was greatly pleased and
said, "Praise be to the Lord today, for he
has given David a wise son to rule over
this great nation."
8So Hiram sent word to Solomon: "I
have received the message you sent me
and will do all you want in providing the
cedar and pine logs.
9My men will haul them down from
Lebanon to the sea, and I will float them
in rafts by sea to the place you specify.
There I will separate them and you can
take them away. And you are to grant
my wish by providing food for my royal
household."
10In this way Hiram kept Solomon
supplied with all the cedar and pine logs
he wanted,
11and Solomon gave Hiram twenty
thousand cors of wheat as food for his
household, in addition to twenty
thousand baths , of pressed olive oil.
Solomon continued to do this for Hiram
year after year.
12The Lord gave Solomon wisdom, just
as he had promised him. There were
peaceful relations between Hiram and
Solomon, and the two of them made a
treaty.
13King Solomon conscripted laborers
from all Israel-thirty thousand men.
14He sent them off to Lebanon in shifts
of ten thousand a month, so that they
spent one month in Lebanon and two
months at home. Adoniram was in
charge of the forced labor.
15Solomon had seventy thousand
carriers and eighty thousand
stonecutters in the hills,
16as well as thirty-three hundred
foremen who supervised the project and
directed the workmen.
17At the king's command they removed
from the quarry large blocks of quality
stone to provide a foundation of dressed
stone for the temple.
18The craftsmen of Solomon and Hiram
and the men of Gebal cut and prepared
the timber and stone for the building of
the temple.
6In the four hundred and eightieth
year after the Israelites had come out of
Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's
reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, the
second month, he began to build the
temple of the Lord .
2The temple that King Solomon built for
the Lord was sixty cubits long, twenty
wide and thirty high.
3The portico at the front of the main hall
of the temple extended the width of the
temple, that is twenty cubits, and
projected ten cubits from the front of the
temple.
4He made narrow clerestory windows in
the temple.
5Against the walls of the main hall and
inner sanctuary he built a structure
around the building, in which there were
side rooms.
6The lowest floor was five cubits wide,
the middle floor six cubits and the third
floor seven. He made offset ledges
around the outside of the temple so that
nothing would be inserted into the
temple walls.
7In building the temple, only blocks
dressed at the quarry were used, and no
hammer, chisel or any other iron tool
was heard at the temple site while it was
being built.
8The entrance to the lowest floor was on
the south side of the temple; a stairway
led up to the middle level and from there
to the third.
9So he built the temple and completed it,
roofing it with beams and cedar planks.
10And he built the side rooms all along
the temple. The height of each was five
cubits, and they were attached to the
temple by beams of cedar.
11The word of the Lord came to
Solomon:
12"As for this temple you are building, if
you follow my decrees, carry out my
regulations and keep all my commands
and obey them, I will fulfill through you
the promise I gave to David your father.
13And I will live among the Israelites and
will not abandon my people Israel."
14So Solomon built the temple and
completed it.
15He lined its interior walls with cedar
boards, paneling them from the floor of
the temple to the ceiling, and covered
the floor of the temple with planks of
pine.
16He partitioned off twenty cubits at the
rear of the temple with cedar boards
from floor to ceiling to form within the
temple an inner sanctuary, the Most
Holy Place.
17The main hall in front of this room was
forty cubits long.
18The inside of the temple was cedar,
carved with gourds and open flowers.
Everything was cedar; no stone was to
be seen.
19He prepared the inner sanctuary within
the temple to set the ark of the covenant
of the Lord there.
20The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits
long, twenty wide and twenty high. He
overlaid the inside with pure gold, and
he also overlaid the altar of cedar.
21Solomon covered the inside of the
temple with pure gold, and he extended
gold chains across the front of the inner
sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold.
22So he overlaid the whole interior with
gold. He also overlaid with gold the altar
that belonged to the inner sanctuary.
23In the inner sanctuary he made a pair
of cherubim of olive wood, each ten
cubits high.
24One wing of the first cherub was five
cubits long, and the other wing five
cubits-ten cubits from wing tip to wing tip.
25The second cherub also measured ten
cubits, for the two cherubim were
identical in size and shape.
26The height of each cherub was ten
cubits.
27He placed the cherubim inside the
innermost room of the temple, with their
wings spread out. The wing of one
cherub touched one wall, while the wing
of the other touched the other wall, and
their wings touched each other in the
middle of the room.
28He overlaid the cherubim with gold.
29On the walls all around the temple, in
both the inner and outer rooms, he
carved cherubim, palm trees and open
flowers.
30He also covered the floors of both the
inner and outer rooms of the temple with
gold.
31For the entrance of the inner sanctuary
he made doors of olive wood with fivesided
jambs.
32And on the two olive wood doors he
carved cherubim, palm trees and open
flowers, and overlaid the cherubim and
palm trees with beaten gold.
33In the same way he made four-sided
jambs of olive wood for the entrance to
the main hall.
34He also made two pine doors, each
having two leaves that turned in sockets.
35He carved cherubim, palm trees and
open flowers on them and overlaid them
with gold hammered evenly over the
carvings.
36And he built the inner courtyard of
three courses of dressed stone and one
course of trimmed cedar beams.
37The foundation of the temple of the
Lord was laid in the fourth year, in the
month of Ziv.
38In the eleventh year in the month of
Bul, the eighth month, the temple was
finished in all its details according to its
specifications. He had spent seven
years building it.
7It took Solomon thirteen years,
however, to complete the construction of
his palace.
2He built the Palace of the Forest of
Lebanon a hundred cubits long, fifty
wide and thirty high, with four rows of
cedar columns supporting trimmed
cedar beams.
3It was roofed with cedar above the
beams that rested on the columns-fortyfive
beams, fifteen to a row.
4Its windows were placed high in sets of
three, facing each other.
5All the doorways had rectangular
frames; they were in the front part in
sets of three, facing each other.
6He made a colonnade fifty cubits long
and thirty wide. In front of it was a
portico, and in front of that were pillars
and an overhanging roof.
7He built the throne hall, the Hall of
Justice, where he was to judge, and he
covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling.
8And the palace in which he was to live,
set farther back, was similar in design.
Solomon also made a palace like this
hall for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he
had married.
9All these structures, from the outside to
the great courtyard and from foundation
to eaves, were made of blocks of highgrade
stone cut to size and trimmed with
a saw on their inner and outer faces.
10The foundations were laid with large
stones of good quality, some measuring
ten cubits and some eight.
11Above were high-grade stones, cut to
size, and cedar beams.
12The great courtyard was surrounded
by a wall of three courses of dressed
stone and one course of trimmed cedar
beams, as was the inner courtyard of
the temple of the Lord with its portico.
13King Solomon sent to Tyre and
brought Huram,
14whose mother was a widow from the
tribe of Naphtali and whose father was a
man of Tyre and a craftsman in bronze.
Huram was highly skilled and
experienced in all kinds of bronze work.
He came to King Solomon and did all
the work assigned to him.
15He cast two bronze pillars, each
eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits
around, by line.
16He also made two capitals of cast
bronze to set on the tops of the pillars;
each capital was five cubits high.
17A network of interwoven chains
festooned the capitals on top of the
pillars, seven for each capital.
18He made pomegranates in two rows
encircling each network to decorate the
capitals on top of the pillars. He did the
same for each capital.
19The capitals on top of the pillars in the
portico were in the shape of lilies, four
cubits high.
20On the capitals of both pillars, above
the bowl-shaped part next to the
network, were the two hundred
pomegranates in rows all around.
21He erected the pillars at the portico of
the temple. The pillar to the south he
named Jakin and the one to the north
Boaz.
22The capitals on top were in the shape
of lilies. And so the work on the pillars
was completed.
23He made the Sea of cast metal,
circular in shape, measuring ten cubits
from rim to rim and five cubits high. It
took a line of thirty cubits to measure
around it.
24Below the rim, gourds encircled it-ten
to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two
rows in one piece with the Sea.
25The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three
facing north, three facing west, three
facing south and three facing east. The
Sea rested on top of them, and their
hindquarters were toward the center.
26It was a handbreadth in thickness, and
its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a
lily blossom. It held two thousand baths.
27He also made ten movable stands of
bronze; each was four cubits long, four
wide and three high.
28This is how the stands were made:
They had side panels attached to
uprights.
29On the panels between the uprights
were lions, bulls and cherubim-and on
the uprights as well. Above and below
the lions and bulls were wreaths of
hammered work.
30Each stand had four bronze wheels
with bronze axles, and each had a basin
resting on four supports, cast with
wreaths on each side.
31On the inside of the stand there was
an opening that had a circular frame one
cubit deep. This opening was round,
and with its basework it measured a
cubit and a half. Around its opening
there was engraving. The panels of the
stands were square, not round.
32The four wheels were under the
panels, and the axles of the wheels
were attached to the stand. The
diameter of each wheel was a cubit and
a half.
33The wheels were made like chariot
wheels; the axles, rims, spokes and
hubs were all of cast metal.
34Each stand had four handles, one on
each corner, projecting from the stand.
35At the top of the stand there was a
circular band half a cubit deep. The
supports and panels were attached to
the top of the stand.
36He engraved cherubim, lions and palm
trees on the surfaces of the supports
and on the panels, in every available
space, with wreaths all around.
37This is the way he made the ten
stands. They were all cast in the same
molds and were identical in size and
shape.
38He then made ten bronze basins, each
holding forty baths and measuring four
cubits across, one basin to go on each
of the ten stands.
39He placed five of the stands on the
south side of the temple and five on the
north. He placed the Sea on the south
side, at the southeast corner of the
temple.
40He also made the basins and shovels
and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished
all the work he had undertaken for King
Solomon in the temple of the Lord :
41the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped
capitals on top of the pillars; the two
sets of network decorating the two bowlshaped
capitals on top of the pillars;
42the four hundred pomegranates for the
two sets of network (two rows of
pomegranates for each network,
decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on
top of the pillars);
43the ten stands with their ten basins;
44the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;
45the pots, shovels and sprinkling bowls.
All these objects that Huram made for
King Solomon for the temple of the Lord
were of burnished bronze.
46The king had them cast in clay molds
in the plain of the Jordan between
Succoth and Zarethan.
47Solomon left all these things
unweighed, because there were so
many; the weight of the bronze was not
determined.
48Solomon also made all the furnishings
that were in the Lord 's temple: the
golden altar; the golden table on which
was the bread of the Presence;
49the lampstands of pure gold (five on
the right and five on the left, in front of
the inner sanctuary); the gold floral work
and lamps and tongs;
50the pure gold basins, wick trimmers,
sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers;
and the gold sockets for the doors of the
innermost room, the Most Holy Place,
and also for the doors of the main hall of
the temple.
51When all the work King Solomon had
done for the temple of the Lord was
finished, he brought in the things his
father David had dedicated-the silver
and gold and the furnishings-and he
placed them in the treasuries of the Lord
's temple.
8Then King Solomon summoned into
his presence at Jerusalem the elders of
Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the
chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring
up the ark of the Lord 's covenant from
Zion, the City of David.
2All the men of Israel came together to
King Solomon at the time of the festival
in the month of Ethanim, the seventh
month.
3When all the elders of Israel had
arrived, the priests took up the ark,
4and they brought up the ark of the Lord
and the Tent of Meeting and all the
sacred furnishings in it. The priests and
Levites carried them up,
5and King Solomon and the entire
assembly of Israel that had gathered
about him were before the ark,
sacrificing so many sheep and cattle
that they could not be recorded or
counted.
6The priests then brought the ark of the
Lord 's covenant to its place in the inner
sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy
Place, and put it beneath the wings of
the cherubim.
7The cherubim spread their wings over
the place of the ark and overshadowed
the ark and its carrying poles.
8These poles were so long that their
ends could be seen from the Holy Place
in front of the inner sanctuary, but not
from outside the Holy Place; and they
are still there today.
9There was nothing in the ark except the
two stone tablets that Moses had placed
in it at Horeb, where the Lord made a
covenant with the Israelites after they
came out of Egypt.
10When the priests withdrew from the
Holy Place, the cloud filled the temple of
the Lord .
11And the priests could not perform their
service because of the cloud, for the
glory of the Lord filled his temple.
12Then Solomon said, "The Lord has
said that he would dwell in a dark cloud;
13I have indeed built a magnificent
temple for you, a place for you to dwell
forever."
14While the whole assembly of Israel
was standing there, the king turned
around and blessed them.
15Then he said: "Praise be to the Lord ,
the God of Israel, who with his own
hand has fulfilled what he promised with
his own mouth to my father David. For
he said,
16'Since the day I brought my people
Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a
city in any tribe of Israel to have a
temple built for my Name to be there,
but I have chosen David to rule my
people Israel.'
17"My father David had it in his heart to
build a temple for the Name of the Lord ,
the God of Israel.
18But the Lord said to my father David,
'Because it was in your heart to build a
temple for my Name, you did well to
have this in your heart.
19Nevertheless, you are not the one to
build the temple, but your son, who is
your own flesh and blood-he is the one
who will build the temple for my Name.'
20"The Lord has kept the promise he
made: I have succeeded David my
father and now I sit on the throne of
Israel, just as the Lord promised, and I
have built the temple for the Name of
the Lord , the God of Israel.
21I have provided a place there for the
ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord
that he made with our fathers when he
brought them out of Egypt."
22Then Solomon stood before the altar
of the Lord in front of the whole
assembly of Israel, spread out his hands
toward heaven
23and said: "O Lord , God of Israel, there
is no God like you in heaven above or
on earth below-you who keep your
covenant of love with your servants who
continue wholeheartedly in your way.
24You have kept your promise to your
servant David my father; with your
mouth you have promised and with your
hand you have fulfilled it-as it is today.
25"Now Lord , God of Israel, keep for
your servant David my father the
promises you made to him when you
said, 'You shall never fail to have a man
to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if
only your sons are careful in all they do
to walk before me as you have done.'
26And now, O God of Israel, let your
word that you promised your servant
David my father come true.
27"But will God really dwell on earth?
The heavens, even the highest heaven,
cannot contain you. How much less this
temple I have built!
28Yet give attention to your servant's
prayer and his plea for mercy, O Lord
my God. Hear the cry and the prayer
that your servant is praying in your
presence this day.
29May your eyes be open toward this
temple night and day, this place of
which you said, 'My Name shall be
there,' so that you will hear the prayer
your servant prays toward this place.
30Hear the supplication of your servant
and of your people Israel when they
pray toward this place. Hear from
heaven, your dwelling place, and when
you hear, forgive.
31"When a man wrongs his neighbor and
is required to take an oath and he
comes and swears the oath before your
altar in this temple,
32then hear from heaven and act. Judge
between your servants, condemning the
guilty and bringing down on his own
head what he has done. Declare the
innocent not guilty, and so establish his
innocence.
33"When your people Israel have been
defeated by an enemy because they
have sinned against you, and when they
turn back to you and confess your name,
praying and making supplication to you
in this temple,
34then hear from heaven and forgive the
sin of your people Israel and bring them
back to the land you gave to their
fathers.
35"When the heavens are shut up and
there is no rain because your people
have sinned against you, and when they
pray toward this place and confess your
name and turn from their sin because
you have afflicted them,
36then hear from heaven and forgive the
sin of your servants, your people Israel.
Teach them the right way to live, and
send rain on the land you gave your
people for an inheritance.
37"When famine or plague comes to the
land, or blight or mildew, locusts or
grasshoppers, or when an enemy
besieges them in any of their cities,
whatever disaster or disease may come,
38and when a prayer or plea is made by
any of your people Israel-each one
aware of the afflictions of his own heart,
and spreading out his hands toward this
temple-
39then hear from heaven, your dwelling
place. Forgive and act; deal with each
man according to all he does, since you
know his heart (for you alone know the
hearts of all men),
40so that they will fear you all the time
they live in the land you gave our fathers.
41"As for the foreigner who does not
belong to your people Israel but has
come from a distant land because of
your name-
42for men will hear of your great name
and your mighty hand and your
outstretched arm-when he comes and
prays toward this temple,
43then hear from heaven, your dwelling
place, and do whatever the foreigner
asks of you, so that all the peoples of
the earth may know your name and fear
you, as do your own people Israel, and
may know that this house I have built
bears your Name.
44"When your people go to war against
their enemies, wherever you send them,
and when they pray to the Lord toward
the city you have chosen and the temple
I have built for your Name,
45then hear from heaven their prayer
and their plea, and uphold their cause.
46"When they sin against you-for there is
no one who does not sin-and you
become angry with them and give them
over to the enemy, who takes them
captive to his own land, far away or
near;
47and if they have a change of heart in
the land where they are held captive,
and repent and plead with you in the
land of their conquerors and say, 'We
have sinned, we have done wrong, we
have acted wickedly';
48and if they turn back to you with all
their heart and soul in the land of their
enemies who took them captive, and
pray to you toward the land you gave
their fathers, toward the city you have
chosen and the temple I have built for
your Name;
49then from heaven, your dwelling place,
hear their prayer and their plea, and
uphold their cause.
50And forgive your people, who have
sinned against you; forgive all the
offenses they have committed against
you, and cause their conquerors to
show them mercy;
51for they are your people and your
inheritance, whom you brought out of
Egypt, out of that iron-smelting furnace.
52"May your eyes be open to your
servant's plea and to the plea of your
people Israel, and may you listen to
them whenever they cry out to you.
53For you singled them out from all the
nations of the world to be your own
inheritance, just as you declared
through your servant Moses when you,
O Sovereign Lord , brought our fathers
out of Egypt."
54When Solomon had finished all these
prayers and supplications to the Lord ,
he rose from before the altar of the Lord ,
where he had been kneeling with his
hands spread out toward heaven.
55He stood and blessed the whole
assembly of Israel in a loud voice,
saying:
56"Praise be to the Lord , who has given
rest to his people Israel just as he
promised. Not one word has failed of all
the good promises he gave through his
servant Moses.
57May the Lord our God be with us as he
was with our fathers; may he never
leave us nor forsake us.
58May he turn our hearts to him, to walk
in all his ways and to keep the
commands, decrees and regulations he
gave our fathers.
59And may these words of mine, which I
have prayed before the Lord , be near to
the Lord our God day and night, that he
may uphold the cause of his servant and
the cause of his people Israel according
to each day's need,
60so that all the peoples of the earth may
know that the Lord is God and that there
is no other.
61But your hearts must be fully
committed to the Lord our God, to live
by his decrees and obey his commands,
as at this time."
62Then the king and all Israel with him
offered sacrifices before the Lord .
63Solomon offered a sacrifice of
fellowship offerings to the Lord : twentytwo
thousand cattle and a hundred and
twenty thousand sheep and goats. So
the king and all the Israelites dedicated
the temple of the Lord .
64On that same day the king
consecrated the middle part of the
courtyard in front of the temple of the
Lord , and there he offered burnt
offerings, grain offerings and the fat of
the fellowship offerings, because the
bronze altar before the Lord was too
small to hold the burnt offerings, the
grain offerings and the fat of the
fellowship offerings.
65So Solomon observed the festival at
that time, and all Israel with him-a vast
assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to
the Wadi of Egypt. They celebrated it
before the Lord our God for seven days
and seven days more, fourteen days in
all.
66On the following day he sent the
people away. They blessed the king and
then went home, joyful and glad in heart
for all the good things the Lord had done
for his servant David and his people
Israel.
9When Solomon had finished building
the temple of the Lord and the royal
palace, and had achieved all he had
desired to do,
2the Lord appeared to him a second
time, as he had appeared to him at
Gibeon.
3The Lord said to him: "I have heard the
prayer and plea you have made before
me; I have consecrated this temple,
which you have built, by putting my
Name there forever. My eyes and my
heart will always be there.
4"As for you, if you walk before me in
integrity of heart and uprightness, as
David your father did, and do all I
command and observe my decrees and
laws,
5I will establish your royal throne over
Israel forever, as I promised David your
father when I said, 'You shall never fail
to have a man on the throne of Israel.'
6"But if you or your sons turn away from
me and do not observe the commands
and decrees I have given you and go off
to serve other gods and worship them,
7then I will cut off Israel from the land I
have given them and will reject this
temple I have consecrated for my Name.
Israel will then become a byword and an
object of ridicule among all peoples.
8And though this temple is now imposing,
all who pass by will be appalled and will
scoff and say, 'Why has the Lord done
such a thing to this land and to this
temple?'
9People will answer, 'Because they have
forsaken the Lord their God, who
brought their fathers out of Egypt, and
have embraced other gods, worshiping
and serving them-that is why the Lord
brought all this disaster on them.' "
10At the end of twenty years, during
which Solomon built these two
buildings-the temple of the Lord and the
royal palace-
11King Solomon gave twenty towns in
Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, because
Hiram had supplied him with all the
cedar and pine and gold he wanted.
12But when Hiram went from Tyre to see
the towns that Solomon had given him,
he was not pleased with them.
13"What kind of towns are these you
have given me, my brother?" he asked.
And he called them the Land of Cabul, a
name they have to this day.
14Now Hiram had sent to the king 120
talents of gold.
15Here is the account of the forced labor
King Solomon conscripted to build the
Lord 's temple, his own palace, the
supporting terraces, the wall of
Jerusalem, and Hazor, Megiddo and
Gezer.
16(Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked
and captured Gezer. He had set it on
fire. He killed its Canaanite inhabitants
and then gave it as a wedding gift to his
daughter, Solomon's wife.
17And Solomon rebuilt Gezer.) He built
up Lower Beth Horon,
18Baalath, and Tadmor in the desert,
within his land,
19as well as all his store cities and the
towns for his chariots and for his horses
-whatever he desired to build in
Jerusalem, in Lebanon and throughout
all the territory he ruled.
20All the people left from the Amorites,
Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites
(these peoples were not Israelites),
21that is, their descendants remaining in
the land, whom the Israelites could not
exterminate -these Solomon conscripted
for his slave labor force, as it is to this
day.
22But Solomon did not make slaves of
any of the Israelites; they were his
fighting men, his government officials,
his officers, his captains, and the
commanders of his chariots and
charioteers.
23They were also the chief officials in
charge of Solomon's projects-550
officials supervising the men who did the
work.
24After Pharaoh's daughter had come up
from the City of David to the palace
Solomon had built for her, he
constructed the supporting terraces.
25Three times a year Solomon sacrificed
burnt offerings and fellowship offerings
on the altar he had built for the Lord ,
burning incense before the Lord along
with them, and so fulfilled the temple
obligations.
26King Solomon also built ships at Ezion
Geber, which is near Elath in Edom, on
the shore of the Red Sea.
27And Hiram sent his men-sailors who
knew the sea-to serve in the fleet with
Solomon's men.
28They sailed to Ophir and brought back
420 talents of gold, which they delivered
to King Solomon.
10When the queen of Sheba heard
about the fame of Solomon and his
relation to the name of the Lord , she
came to test him with hard questions.
2Arriving at Jerusalem with a very great
caravan-with camels carrying spices,
large quantities of gold, and precious
stones-she came to Solomon and talked
with him about all that she had on her
mind.
3Solomon answered all her questions;
nothing was too hard for the king to
explain to her.
4When the queen of Sheba saw all the
wisdom of Solomon and the palace he
had built,
5the food on his table, the seating of his
officials, the attending servants in their
robes, his cupbearers, and the burnt
offerings he made at the temple of the
Lord , she was overwhelmed.
6She said to the king, "The report I
heard in my own country about your
achievements and your wisdom is true.
7But I did not believe these things until I
came and saw with my own eyes.
Indeed, not even half was told me; in
wisdom and wealth you have far
exceeded the report I heard.
8How happy your men must be! How
happy your officials, who continually
stand before you and hear your wisdom!
9Praise be to the Lord your God, who
has delighted in you and placed you on
the throne of Israel. Because of the Lord
's eternal love for Israel, he has made
you king, to maintain justice and
righteousness."
10And she gave the king 120 talents of
gold, large quantities of spices, and
precious stones. Never again were so
many spices brought in as those the
queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
11(Hiram's ships brought gold from
Ophir; and from there they brought great
cargoes of almugwood and precious
stones.
12The king used the almugwood to make
supports for the temple of the Lord and
for the royal palace, and to make harps
and lyres for the musicians. So much
almugwood has never been imported or
seen since that day.)
13King Solomon gave the queen of
Sheba all she desired and asked for,
besides what he had given her out of his
royal bounty. Then she left and returned
with her retinue to her own country.
14The weight of the gold that Solomon
received yearly was 666 talents,
15not including the revenues from
merchants and traders and from all the
Arabian kings and the governors of the
land.
16King Solomon made two hundred
large shields of hammered gold; six
hundred bekas of gold went into each
shield.
17He also made three hundred small
shields of hammered gold, with three
minas of gold in each shield. The king
put them in the Palace of the Forest of
Lebanon.
18Then the king made a great throne
inlaid with ivory and overlaid with fine
gold.
19The throne had six steps, and its back
had a rounded top. On both sides of the
seat were armrests, with a lion standing
beside each of them.
20Twelve lions stood on the six steps,
one at either end of each step. Nothing
like it had ever been made for any other
kingdom.
21All King Solomon's goblets were gold,
and all the household articles in the
Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were
pure gold. Nothing was made of silver,
because silver was considered of little
value in Solomon's days.
22The king had a fleet of trading ships at
sea along with the ships of Hiram. Once
every three years it returned, carrying
gold, silver and ivory, and apes and
baboons.
23King Solomon was greater in riches
and wisdom than all the other kings of
the earth.
24The whole world sought audience with
Solomon to hear the wisdom God had
put in his heart.
25Year after year, everyone who came
brought a gift-articles of silver and gold,
robes, weapons and spices, and horses
and mules.
26Solomon accumulated chariots and
horses; he had fourteen hundred
chariots and twelve thousand horses,
which he kept in the chariot cities and
also with him in Jerusalem.
27The king made silver as common in
Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as
plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the
foothills.
28Solomon's horses were imported from
Egypt and from Kue - the royal
merchants purchased them from Kue.
29They imported a chariot from Egypt for
six hundred shekels of silver, and a
horse for a hundred and fifty. They also
exported them to all the kings of the
Hittites and of the Arameans.
11King Solomon, however, loved
many foreign women besides Pharaoh's
daughter-Moabites, Ammonites,
Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites.
2They were from nations about which
the Lord had told the Israelites, "You
must not intermarry with them, because
they will surely turn your hearts after
their gods." Nevertheless, Solomon held
fast to them in love.
3He had seven hundred wives of royal
birth and three hundred concubines, and
his wives led him astray.
4As Solomon grew old, his wives turned
his heart after other gods, and his heart
was not fully devoted to the Lord his
God, as the heart of David his father
had been.
5He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of
the Sidonians, and Molech the
detestable god of the Ammonites.
6So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the
Lord ; he did not follow the Lord
completely, as David his father had
done.
7On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon
built a high place for Chemosh the
detestable god of Moab, and for Molech
the detestable god of the Ammonites.
8He did the same for all his foreign
wives, who burned incense and offered
sacrifices to their gods.
9The Lord became angry with Solomon
because his heart had turned away from
the Lord , the God of Israel, who had
appeared to him twice.
10Although he had forbidden Solomon to
follow other gods, Solomon did not keep
the Lord 's command.
11So the Lord said to Solomon, "Since
this is your attitude and you have not
kept my covenant and my decrees,
which I commanded you, I will most
certainly tear the kingdom away from
you and give it to one of your
subordinates.
12Nevertheless, for the sake of David
your father, I will not do it during your
lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of
your son.
13Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom
from him, but will give him one tribe for
the sake of David my servant and for the
sake of Jerusalem, which I have
chosen."
14Then the Lord raised up against
Solomon an adversary, Hadad the
Edomite, from the royal line of Edom.
15Earlier when David was fighting with
Edom, Joab the commander of the army,
who had gone up to bury the dead, had
struck down all the men in Edom.
16Joab and all the Israelites stayed there
for six months, until they had destroyed
all the men in Edom.
17But Hadad, still only a boy, fled to
Egypt with some Edomite officials who
had served his father.
18They set out from Midian and went to
Paran. Then taking men from Paran with
them, they went to Egypt, to Pharaoh
king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house
and land and provided him with food.
19Pharaoh was so pleased with Hadad
that he gave him a sister of his own wife,
Queen Tahpenes, in marriage.
20The sister of Tahpenes bore him a son
named Genubath, whom Tahpenes
brought up in the royal palace. There
Genubath lived with Pharaoh's own
children.
21While he was in Egypt, Hadad heard
that David rested with his fathers and
that Joab the commander of the army
was also dead. Then Hadad said to
Pharaoh, "Let me go, that I may return
to my own country."
22"What have you lacked here that you
want to go back to your own country?"
Pharaoh asked. "Nothing," Hadad
replied, "but do let me go!"
23And God raised up against Solomon
another adversary, Rezon son of Eliada,
who had fled from his master,
Hadadezer king of Zobah.
24He gathered men around him and
became the leader of a band of rebels
when David destroyed the forces of
Zobah ; the rebels went to Damascus,
where they settled and took control.
25Rezon was Israel's adversary as long
as Solomon lived, adding to the trouble
caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled in
Aram and was hostile toward Israel.
26Also, Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled
against the king. He was one of
Solomon's officials, an Ephraimite from
Zeredah, and his mother was a widow
named Zeruah.
27Here is the account of how he rebelled
against the king: Solomon had built the
supporting terraces and had filled in the
gap in the wall of the city of David his
father.
28Now Jeroboam was a man of standing,
and when Solomon saw how well the
young man did his work, he put him in
charge of the whole labor force of the
house of Joseph.
29About that time Jeroboam was going
out of Jerusalem, and Ahijah the
prophet of Shiloh met him on the way,
wearing a new cloak. The two of them
were alone out in the country,
30and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak
he was wearing and tore it into twelve
pieces.
31Then he said to Jeroboam, "Take ten
pieces for yourself, for this is what the
Lord , the God of Israel, says: 'See, I am
going to tear the kingdom out of
Solomon's hand and give you ten tribes.
32But for the sake of my servant David
and the city of Jerusalem, which I have
chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, he
will have one tribe.
33I will do this because they have
forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth
the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh
the god of the Moabites, and Molech the
god of the Ammonites, and have not
walked in my ways, nor done what is
right in my eyes, nor kept my statutes
and laws as David, Solomon's father,
did.
34" 'But I will not take the whole kingdom
out of Solomon's hand; I have made him
ruler all the days of his life for the sake
of David my servant, whom I chose and
who observed my commands and
statutes.
35I will take the kingdom from his son's
hands and give you ten tribes.
36I will give one tribe to his son so that
David my servant may always have a
lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city
where I chose to put my Name.
37However, as for you, I will take you,
and you will rule over all that your heart
desires; you will be king over Israel.
38If you do whatever I command you and
walk in my ways and do what is right in
my eyes by keeping my statutes and
commands, as David my servant did, I
will be with you. I will build you a
dynasty as enduring as the one I built
for David and will give Israel to you.
39I will humble David's descendants
because of this, but not forever.' "
40Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but
Jeroboam fled to Egypt, to Shishak the
king, and stayed there until Solomon's
death.
41As for the other events of Solomon's
reign-all he did and the wisdom he
displayed-are they not written in the
book of the annals of Solomon?
42Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all
Israel forty years.
43Then he rested with his fathers and
was buried in the city of David his father.
And Rehoboam his son succeeded him
as king.
12Rehoboam went to Shechem, for
all the Israelites had gone there to make
him king.
2When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard
this (he was still in Egypt, where he had
fled from King Solomon), he returned
from Egypt.
3So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and
the whole assembly of Israel went to
Rehoboam and said to him:
4"Your father put a heavy yoke on us,
but now lighten the harsh labor and the
heavy yoke he put on us, and we will
serve you."
5Rehoboam answered, "Go away for
three days and then come back to me."
So the people went away.
6Then King Rehoboam consulted the
elders who had served his father
Solomon during his lifetime. "How would
you advise me to answer these people?"
he asked.
7They replied, "If today you will be a
servant to these people and serve them
and give them a favorable answer, they
will always be your servants."
8But Rehoboam rejected the advice the
elders gave him and consulted the
young men who had grown up with him
and were serving him.
9He asked them, "What is your advice?
How should we answer these people
who say to me, 'Lighten the yoke your
father put on us'?"
10The young men who had grown up
with him replied, "Tell these people who
have said to you, 'Your father put a
heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke
lighter'-tell them, 'My little finger is
thicker than my father's waist.
11My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I
will make it even heavier. My father
scourged you with whips; I will scourge
you with scorpions.' "
12Three days later Jeroboam and all the
people returned to Rehoboam, as the
king had said, "Come back to me in
three days."
13The king answered the people harshly.
Rejecting the advice given him by the
elders,
14he followed the advice of the young
men and said, "My father made your
yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier.
My father scourged you with whips; I will
scourge you with scorpions."
15So the king did not listen to the people,
for this turn of events was from the Lord ,
to fulfill the word the Lord had spoken to
Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah
the Shilonite.
16When all Israel saw that the king
refused to listen to them, they answered
the king: "What share do we have in
David, what part in Jesse's son? To your
tents, O Israel! Look after your own
house, O David!" So the Israelites went
home.
17But as for the Israelites who were
living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam
still ruled over them.
18King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram,
who was in charge of forced labor, but
all Israel stoned him to death. King
Rehoboam, however, managed to get
into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
19So Israel has been in rebellion against
the house of David to this day.
20When all the Israelites heard that
Jeroboam had returned, they sent and
called him to the assembly and made
him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of
Judah remained loyal to the house of
David.
21When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem,
he mustered the whole house of Judah
and the tribe of Benjamin-a hundred and
eighty thousand fighting men-to make
war against the house of Israel and to
regain the kingdom for Rehoboam son
of Solomon.
22But this word of God came to
Shemaiah the man of God:
23"Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon
king of Judah, to the whole house of
Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of
the people,
24'This is what the Lord says: Do not go
up to fight against your brothers, the
Israelites. Go home, every one of you,
for this is my doing.' " So they obeyed
the word of the Lord and went home
again, as the Lord had ordered.
25Then Jeroboam fortified Shechem in
the hill country of Ephraim and lived
there. From there he went out and built
up Peniel.
26Jeroboam thought to himself, "The
kingdom will now likely revert to the
house of David.
27If these people go up to offer sacrifices
at the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem,
they will again give their allegiance to
their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah.
They will kill me and return to King
Rehoboam."
28After seeking advice, the king made
two golden calves. He said to the people,
"It is too much for you to go up to
Jerusalem. Here are your gods, O Israel,
who brought you up out of Egypt."
29One he set up in Bethel, and the other
in Dan.
30And this thing became a sin; the
people went even as far as Dan to
worship the one there.
31Jeroboam built shrines on high places
and appointed priests from all sorts of
people, even though they were not
Levites.
32He instituted a festival on the fifteenth
day of the eighth month, like the festival
held in Judah, and offered sacrifices on
the altar. This he did in Bethel,
sacrificing to the calves he had made.
And at Bethel he also installed priests at
the high places he had made.
33On the fifteenth day of the eighth
month, a month of his own choosing, he
offered sacrifices on the altar he had
built at Bethel. So he instituted the
festival for the Israelites and went up to
the altar to make offerings.
13By the word of the Lord a man of
God came from Judah to Bethel, as
Jeroboam was standing by the altar to
make an offering.
2He cried out against the altar by the
word of the Lord : "O altar, altar! This is
what the Lord says: 'A son named
Josiah will be born to the house of David.
On you he will sacrifice the priests of the
high places who now make offerings
here, and human bones will be burned
on you.' "
3That same day the man of God gave a
sign: "This is the sign the Lord has
declared: The altar will be split apart and
the ashes on it will be poured out."
4When King Jeroboam heard what the
man of God cried out against the altar at
Bethel, he stretched out his hand from
the altar and said, "Seize him!" But the
hand he stretched out toward the man
shriveled up, so that he could not pull it
back.
5Also, the altar was split apart and its
ashes poured out according to the sign
given by the man of God by the word of
the Lord .
6Then the king said to the man of God,
"Intercede with the Lord your God and
pray for me that my hand may be
restored." So the man of God interceded
with the Lord , and the king's hand was
restored and became as it was before.
7The king said to the man of God,
"Come home with me and have
something to eat, and I will give you a
gift."
8But the man of God answered the king,
"Even if you were to give me half your
possessions, I would not go with you,
nor would I eat bread or drink water
here.
9For I was commanded by the word of
the Lord : 'You must not eat bread or
drink water or return by the way you
came.' "
10So he took another road and did not
return by the way he had come to Bethel.
11Now there was a certain old prophet
living in Bethel, whose sons came and
told him all that the man of God had
done there that day. They also told their
father what he had said to the king.
12Their father asked them, "Which way
did he go?" And his sons showed him
which road the man of God from Judah
had taken.
13So he said to his sons, "Saddle the
donkey for me." And when they had
saddled the donkey for him, he mounted
it
14and rode after the man of God. He
found him sitting under an oak tree and
asked, "Are you the man of God who
came from Judah?" "I am," he replied.
15So the prophet said to him, "Come
home with me and eat."
16The man of God said, "I cannot turn
back and go with you, nor can I eat
bread or drink water with you in this
place.
17I have been told by the word of the
Lord : 'You must not eat bread or drink
water there or return by the way you
came.' "
18The old prophet answered, "I too am a
prophet, as you are. And an angel said
to me by the word of the Lord : 'Bring
him back with you to your house so that
he may eat bread and drink water.' "
(But he was lying to him.)
19So the man of God returned with him
and ate and drank in his house.
20While they were sitting at the table, the
word of the Lord came to the old
prophet who had brought him back.
21He cried out to the man of God who
had come from Judah, "This is what the
Lord says: 'You have defied the word of
the Lord and have not kept the
command the Lord your God gave you.
22You came back and ate bread and
drank water in the place where he told
you not to eat or drink. Therefore your
body will not be buried in the tomb of
your fathers.' "
23When the man of God had finished
eating and drinking, the prophet who
had brought him back saddled his
donkey for him.
24As he went on his way, a lion met him
on the road and killed him, and his body
was thrown down on the road, with both
the donkey and the lion standing beside
it.
25Some people who passed by saw the
body thrown down there, with the lion
standing beside the body, and they went
and reported it in the city where the old
prophet lived.
26When the prophet who had brought
him back from his journey heard of it, he
said, "It is the man of God who defied
the word of the Lord . The Lord has
given him over to the lion, which has
mauled him and killed him, as the word
of the Lord had warned him."
27The prophet said to his sons, "Saddle
the donkey for me," and they did so.
28Then he went out and found the body
thrown down on the road, with the
donkey and the lion standing beside it.
The lion had neither eaten the body nor
mauled the donkey.
29So the prophet picked up the body of
the man of God, laid it on the donkey,
and brought it back to his own city to
mourn for him and bury him.
30Then he laid the body in his own tomb,
and they mourned over him and said,
"Oh, my brother!"
31After burying him, he said to his sons,
"When I die, bury me in the grave where
the man of God is buried; lay my bones
beside his bones.
32For the message he declared by the
word of the Lord against the altar in
Bethel and against all the shrines on the
high places in the towns of Samaria will
certainly come true."
33Even after this, Jeroboam did not
change his evil ways, but once more
appointed priests for the high places
from all sorts of people. Anyone who
wanted to become a priest he
consecrated for the high places.
34This was the sin of the house of
Jeroboam that led to its downfall and to
its destruction from the face of the earth.
14At that time Abijah son of
Jeroboam became ill,
2and Jeroboam said to his wife, "Go,
disguise yourself, so you won't be
recognized as the wife of Jeroboam.
Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is
there-the one who told me I would be
king over this people.
3Take ten loaves of bread with you,
some cakes and a jar of honey, and go
to him. He will tell you what will happen
to the boy."
4So Jeroboam's wife did what he said
and went to Ahijah's house in Shiloh.
Now Ahijah could not see; his sight was
gone because of his age.
5But the Lord had told Ahijah,
"Jeroboam's wife is coming to ask you
about her son, for he is ill, and you are
to give her such and such an answer.
When she arrives, she will pretend to be
someone else."
6So when Ahijah heard the sound of her
footsteps at the door, he said, "Come in,
wife of Jeroboam. Why this pretense? I
have been sent to you with bad news.
7Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the
Lord , the God of Israel, says: 'I raised
you up from among the people and
made you a leader over my people
Israel.
8I tore the kingdom away from the house
of David and gave it to you, but you
have not been like my servant David,
who kept my commands and followed
me with all his heart, doing only what
was right in my eyes.
9You have done more evil than all who
lived before you. You have made for
yourself other gods, idols made of
metal; you have provoked me to anger
and thrust me behind your back.
10" 'Because of this, I am going to bring
disaster on the house of Jeroboam. I will
cut off from Jeroboam every last male in
Israel-slave or free. I will burn up the
house of Jeroboam as one burns dung,
until it is all gone.
11Dogs will eat those belonging to
Jeroboam who die in the city, and the
birds of the air will feed on those who
die in the country. The Lord has
spoken!'
12"As for you, go back home. When you
set foot in your city, the boy will die.
13All Israel will mourn for him and bury
him. He is the only one belonging to
Jeroboam who will be buried, because
he is the only one in the house of
Jeroboam in whom the Lord , the God of
Israel, has found anything good.
14"The Lord will raise up for himself a
king over Israel who will cut off the
family of Jeroboam. This is the day!
What? Yes, even now.
15And the Lord will strike Israel, so that it
will be like a reed swaying in the water.
He will uproot Israel from this good land
that he gave to their forefathers and
scatter them beyond the River, because
they provoked the Lord to anger by
making Asherah poles.
16And he will give Israel up because of
the sins Jeroboam has committed and
has caused Israel to commit."
17Then Jeroboam's wife got up and left
and went to Tirzah. As soon as she
stepped over the threshold of the house,
the boy died.
18They buried him, and all Israel
mourned for him, as the Lord had said
through his servant the prophet Ahijah.
19The other events of Jeroboam's reign,
his wars and how he ruled, are written in
the book of the annals of the kings of
Israel.
20He reigned for twenty-two years and
then rested with his fathers. And Nadab
his son succeeded him as king.
21Rehoboam son of Solomon was king
in Judah. He was forty-one years old
when he became king, and he reigned
seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city
the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes
of Israel in which to put his Name. His
mother's name was Naamah; she was
an Ammonite.
22Judah did evil in the eyes of the Lord .
By the sins they committed they stirred
up his jealous anger more than their
fathers had done.
23They also set up for themselves high
places, sacred stones and Asherah
poles on every high hill and under every
spreading tree.
24There were even male shrine
prostitutes in the land; the people
engaged in all the detestable practices
of the nations the Lord had driven out
before the Israelites.
25In the fifth year of King Rehoboam,
Shishak king of Egypt attacked
Jerusalem.
26He carried off the treasures of the
temple of the Lord and the treasures of
the royal palace. He took everything,
including all the gold shields Solomon
had made.
27So King Rehoboam made bronze
shields to replace them and assigned
these to the commanders of the guard
on duty at the entrance to the royal
palace.
28Whenever the king went to the Lord 's
temple, the guards bore the shields, and
afterward they returned them to the
guardroom.
29As for the other events of Rehoboam's
reign, and all he did, are they not written
in the book of the annals of the kings of
Judah?
30There was continual warfare between
Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
31And Rehoboam rested with his fathers
and was buried with them in the City of
David. His mother's name was Naamah;
she was an Ammonite. And Abijah his
son succeeded him as king.
15In the eighteenth year of the reign
of Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijah
became king of Judah,
2and he reigned in Jerusalem three
years. His mother's name was Maacah
daughter of Abishalom.
3He committed all the sins his father had
done before him; his heart was not fully
devoted to the Lord his God, as the
heart of David his forefather had been.
4Nevertheless, for David's sake the Lord
his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem
by raising up a son to succeed him and
by making Jerusalem strong.
5For David had done what was right in
the eyes of the Lord and had not failed
to keep any of the Lord 's commands all
the days of his life-except in the case of
Uriah the Hittite.
6There was war between Rehoboam
and Jeroboam throughout Abijah's
lifetime.
7As for the other events of Abijah's reign,
and all he did, are they not written in the
book of the annals of the kings of
Judah? There was war between Abijah
and Jeroboam.
8And Abijah rested with his fathers and
was buried in the City of David. And Asa
his son succeeded him as king.
9In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king
of Israel, Asa became king of Judah,
10and he reigned in Jerusalem forty-one
years. His grandmother's name was
Maacah daughter of Abishalom.
11Asa did what was right in the eyes of
the Lord , as his father David had done.
12He expelled the male shrine
prostitutes from the land and got rid of
all the idols his fathers had made.
13He even deposed his grandmother
Maacah from her position as queen
mother, because she had made a
repulsive Asherah pole. Asa cut the pole
down and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
14Although he did not remove the high
places, Asa's heart was fully committed
to the Lord all his life.
15He brought into the temple of the Lord
the silver and gold and the articles that
he and his father had dedicated.
16There was war between Asa and
Baasha king of Israel throughout their
reigns.
17Baasha king of Israel went up against
Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent
anyone from leaving or entering the
territory of Asa king of Judah.
18Asa then took all the silver and gold
that was left in the treasuries of the Lord
's temple and of his own palace. He
entrusted it to his officials and sent them
to Ben-Hadad son of Tabrimmon, the
son of Hezion, the king of Aram, who
was ruling in Damascus.
19"Let there be a treaty between me and
you," he said, "as there was between my
father and your father. See, I am
sending you a gift of silver and gold.
Now break your treaty with Baasha king
of Israel so he will withdraw from me."
20Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and
sent the commanders of his forces
against the towns of Israel. He
conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maacah
and all Kinnereth in addition to Naphtali.
21When Baasha heard this, he stopped
building Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah.
22Then King Asa issued an order to all
Judah-no one was exempt-and they
carried away from Ramah the stones
and timber Baasha had been using
there. With them King Asa built up Geba
in Benjamin, and also Mizpah.
23As for all the other events of Asa's
reign, all his achievements, all he did
and the cities he built, are they not
written in the book of the annals of the
kings of Judah? In his old age, however,
his feet became diseased.
24Then Asa rested with his fathers and
was buried with them in the city of his
father David. And Jehoshaphat his son
succeeded him as king.
25Nadab son of Jeroboam became king
of Israel in the second year of Asa king
of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two
years.
26He did evil in the eyes of the Lord ,
walking in the ways of his father and in
his sin, which he had caused Israel to
commit.
27Baasha son of Ahijah of the house of
Issachar plotted against him, and he
struck him down at Gibbethon, a
Philistine town, while Nadab and all
Israel were besieging it.
28Baasha killed Nadab in the third year
of Asa king of Judah and succeeded
him as king.
29As soon as he began to reign, he killed
Jeroboam's whole family. He did not
leave Jeroboam anyone that breathed,
but destroyed them all, according to the
word of the Lord given through his
servant Ahijah the Shilonite-
30because of the sins Jeroboam had
committed and had caused Israel to
commit, and because he provoked the
Lord , the God of Israel, to anger.
31As for the other events of Nadab's
reign, and all he did, are they not written
in the book of the annals of the kings of
Israel?
32There was war between Asa and
Baasha king of Israel throughout their
reigns.
33In the third year of Asa king of Judah,
Baasha son of Ahijah became king of all
Israel in Tirzah, and he reigned twentyfour
years.
34He did evil in the eyes of the Lord ,
walking in the ways of Jeroboam and in
his sin, which he had caused Israel to
commit.
16Then the word of the Lord came to
Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha:
2"I lifted you up from the dust and made
you leader of my people Israel, but you
walked in the ways of Jeroboam and
caused my people Israel to sin and to
provoke me to anger by their sins.
3So I am about to consume Baasha and
his house, and I will make your house
like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat.
4Dogs will eat those belonging to
Baasha who die in the city, and the birds
of the air will feed on those who die in
the country."
5As for the other events of Baasha's
reign, what he did and his achievements,
are they not written in the book of the
annals of the kings of Israel?
6Baasha rested with his fathers and was
buried in Tirzah. And Elah his son
succeeded him as king.
7Moreover, the word of the Lord came
through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani
to Baasha and his house, because of all
the evil he had done in the eyes of the
Lord , provoking him to anger by the
things he did, and becoming like the
house of Jeroboam-and also because
he destroyed it.
8In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of
Judah, Elah son of Baasha became king
of Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah two
years.
9Zimri, one of his officials, who had
command of half his chariots, plotted
against him. Elah was in Tirzah at the
time, getting drunk in the home of Arza,
the man in charge of the palace at
Tirzah.
10Zimri came in, struck him down and
killed him in the twenty-seventh year of
Asa king of Judah. Then he succeeded
him as king.
11As soon as he began to reign and was
seated on the throne, he killed off
Baasha's whole family. He did not spare
a single male, whether relative or friend.
12So Zimri destroyed the whole family of
Baasha, in accordance with the word of
the Lord spoken against Baasha
through the prophet Jehu-
13because of all the sins Baasha and his
son Elah had committed and had
caused Israel to commit, so that they
provoked the Lord , the God of Israel, to
anger by their worthless idols.
14As for the other events of Elah's reign,
and all he did, are they not written in the
book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
15In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king
of Judah, Zimri reigned in Tirzah seven
days. The army was encamped near
Gibbethon, a Philistine town.
16When the Israelites in the camp heard
that Zimri had plotted against the king
and murdered him, they proclaimed
Omri, the commander of the army, king
over Israel that very day there in the
camp.
17Then Omri and all the Israelites with
him withdrew from Gibbethon and laid
siege to Tirzah.
18When Zimri saw that the city was
taken, he went into the citadel of the
royal palace and set the palace on fire
around him. So he died,
19because of the sins he had committed,
doing evil in the eyes of the Lord and
walking in the ways of Jeroboam and in
the sin he had committed and had
caused Israel to commit.
20As for the other events of Zimri's reign,
and the rebellion he carried out, are they
not written in the book of the annals of
the kings of Israel?
21Then the people of Israel were split
into two factions; half supported Tibni
son of Ginath for king, and the other half
supported Omri.
22But Omri's followers proved stronger
than those of Tibni son of Ginath. So
Tibni died and Omri became king.
23In the thirty-first year of Asa king of
Judah, Omri became king of Israel, and
he reigned twelve years, six of them in
Tirzah.
24He bought the hill of Samaria from
Shemer for two talents of silver and built
a city on the hill, calling it Samaria, after
Shemer, the name of the former owner
of the hill.
25But Omri did evil in the eyes of the
Lord and sinned more than all those
before him.
26He walked in all the ways of Jeroboam
son of Nebat and in his sin, which he
had caused Israel to commit, so that
they provoked the Lord , the God of
Israel, to anger by their worthless idols.
27As for the other events of Omri's reign,
what he did and the things he achieved,
are they not written in the book of the
annals of the kings of Israel?
28Omri rested with his fathers and was
buried in Samaria. And Ahab his son
succeeded him as king.
29In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of
Judah, Ahab son of Omri became king
of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria
over Israel twenty-two years.
30Ahab son of Omri did more evil in the
eyes of the Lord than any of those
before him.
31He not only considered it trivial to
commit the sins of Jeroboam son of
Nebat, but he also married Jezebel
daughter of Ethbaal king of the
Sidonians, and began to serve Baal and
worship him.
32He set up an altar for Baal in the
temple of Baal that he built in Samaria.
33Ahab also made an Asherah pole and
did more to provoke the Lord , the God
of Israel, to anger than did all the kings
of Israel before him.
34In Ahab's time, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt
Jericho. He laid its foundations at the
cost of his firstborn son Abiram, and he
set up its gates at the cost of his
youngest son Segub, in accordance with
the word of the Lord spoken by Joshua
son of Nun.
17Now Elijah the Tishbite, from
Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, "As the
Lord , the God of Israel, lives, whom I
serve, there will be neither dew nor rain
in the next few years except at my
word."
2Then the word of the Lord came to
Elijah:
3"Leave here, turn eastward and hide in
the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan.
4You will drink from the brook, and I
have ordered the ravens to feed you
there."
5So he did what the Lord had told him.
He went to the Kerith Ravine, east of the
Jordan, and stayed there.
6The ravens brought him bread and
meat in the morning and bread and
meat in the evening, and he drank from
the brook.
7Some time later the brook dried up
because there had been no rain in the
land.
8Then the word of the Lord came to him:
9"Go at once to Zarephath of Sidon and
stay there. I have commanded a widow
in that place to supply you with food."
10So he went to Zarephath. When he
came to the town gate, a widow was
there gathering sticks. He called to her
and asked, "Would you bring me a little
water in a jar so I may have a drink?"
11As she was going to get it, he called,
"And bring me, please, a piece of
bread."
12"As surely as the Lord your God lives,"
she replied, "I don't have any bread-only
a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in
a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take
home and make a meal for myself and
my son, that we may eat it-and die."
13Elijah said to her, "Don't be afraid. Go
home and do as you have said. But first
make a small cake of bread for me from
what you have and bring it to me, and
then make something for yourself and
your son.
14For this is what the Lord , the God of
Israel, says: 'The jar of flour will not be
used up and the jug of oil will not run dry
until the day the Lord gives rain on the
land.' "
15She went away and did as Elijah had
told her. So there was food every day
for Elijah and for the woman and her
family.
16For the jar of flour was not used up
and the jug of oil did not run dry, in
keeping with the word of the Lord
spoken by Elijah.
17Some time later the son of the woman
who owned the house became ill. He
grew worse and worse, and finally
stopped breathing.
18She said to Elijah, "What do you have
against me, man of God? Did you come
to remind me of my sin and kill my son?"
19"Give me your son," Elijah replied. He
took him from her arms, carried him to
the upper room where he was staying,
and laid him on his bed.
20Then he cried out to the Lord , "O Lord
my God, have you brought tragedy also
upon this widow I am staying with, by
causing her son to die?"
21Then he stretched himself out on the
boy three times and cried to the Lord ,
"O Lord my God, let this boy's life return
to him!"
22The Lord heard Elijah's cry, and the
boy's life returned to him, and he lived.
23Elijah picked up the child and carried
him down from the room into the house.
He gave him to his mother and said,
"Look, your son is alive!"
24Then the woman said to Elijah, "Now I
know that you are a man of God and
that the word of the Lord from your
mouth is the truth."
18After a long time, in the third year,
the word of the Lord came to Elijah: "Go
and present yourself to Ahab, and I will
send rain on the land."
2So Elijah went to present himself to
Ahab. Now the famine was severe in
Samaria,
3and Ahab had summoned Obadiah,
who was in charge of his palace.
(Obadiah was a devout believer in the
Lord .
4While Jezebel was killing off the Lord 's
prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred
prophets and hidden them in two caves,
fifty in each, and had supplied them with
food and water.)
5Ahab had said to Obadiah, "Go through
the land to all the springs and valleys.
Maybe we can find some grass to keep
the horses and mules alive so we will
not have to kill any of our animals."
6So they divided the land they were to
cover, Ahab going in one direction and
Obadiah in another.
7As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah
met him. Obadiah recognized him,
bowed down to the ground, and said, "Is
it really you, my lord Elijah?"
8"Yes," he replied. "Go tell your master,
'Elijah is here.' "
9"What have I done wrong," asked
Obadiah, "that you are handing your
servant over to Ahab to be put to death?
10As surely as the Lord your God lives,
there is not a nation or kingdom where
my master has not sent someone to
look for you. And whenever a nation or
kingdom claimed you were not there, he
made them swear they could not find
you.
11But now you tell me to go to my
master and say, 'Elijah is here.'
12I don't know where the Spirit of the
Lord may carry you when I leave you. If
I go and tell Ahab and he doesn't find
you, he will kill me. Yet I your servant
have worshiped the Lord since my youth.
13Haven't you heard, my lord, what I did
while Jezebel was killing the prophets of
the Lord ? I hid a hundred of the Lord 's
prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and
supplied them with food and water.
14And now you tell me to go to my
master and say, 'Elijah is here.' He will
kill me!"
15Elijah said, "As the Lord Almighty lives,
whom I serve, I will surely present
myself to Ahab today."
16So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and
told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
17When he saw Elijah, he said to him, "Is
that you, you troubler of Israel?"
18"I have not made trouble for Israel,"
Elijah replied. "But you and your father's
family have. You have abandoned the
Lord 's commands and have followed
the Baals.
19Now summon the people from all over
Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel.
And bring the four hundred and fifty
prophets of Baal and the four hundred
prophets of Asherah, who eat at
Jezebel's table."
20So Ahab sent word throughout all
Israel and assembled the prophets on
Mount Carmel.
21Elijah went before the people and said,
"How long will you waver between two
opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him;
but if Baal is God, follow him." But the
people said nothing.
22Then Elijah said to them, "I am the
only one of the Lord 's prophets left, but
Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets.
23Get two bulls for us. Let them choose
one for themselves, and let them cut it
into pieces and put it on the wood but
not set fire to it. I will prepare the other
bull and put it on the wood but not set
fire to it.
24Then you call on the name of your god,
and I will call on the name of the Lord .
The god who answers by fire-he is
God." Then all the people said, "What
you say is good."
25Elijah said to the prophets of Baal,
"Choose one of the bulls and prepare it
first, since there are so many of you.
Call on the name of your god, but do not
light the fire."
26So they took the bull given them and
prepared it. Then they called on the
name of Baal from morning till noon. "O
Baal, answer us!" they shouted. But
there was no response; no one
answered. And they danced around the
altar they had made.
27At noon Elijah began to taunt them.
"Shout louder!" he said. "Surely he is a
god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or
busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping
and must be awakened."
28So they shouted louder and slashed
themselves with swords and spears, as
was their custom, until their blood
flowed.
29Midday passed, and they continued
their frantic prophesying until the time
for the evening sacrifice. But there was
no response, no one answered, no one
paid attention.
30Then Elijah said to all the people,
"Come here to me." They came to him,
and he repaired the altar of the Lord ,
which was in ruins.
31Elijah took twelve stones, one for each
of the tribes descended from Jacob, to
whom the word of the Lord had come,
saying, "Your name shall be Israel."
32With the stones he built an altar in the
name of the Lord , and he dug a trench
around it large enough to hold two
seahs of seed.
33He arranged the wood, cut the bull into
pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he
said to them, "Fill four large jars with
water and pour it on the offering and on
the wood."
34"Do it again," he said, and they did it
again. "Do it a third time," he ordered,
and they did it the third time.
35The water ran down around the altar
and even filled the trench.
36At the time of sacrifice, the prophet
Elijah stepped forward and prayed: "O
Lord , God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel,
let it be known today that you are God in
Israel and that I am your servant and
have done all these things at your
command.
37Answer me, O Lord , answer me, so
these people will know that you, O Lord ,
are God, and that you are turning their
hearts back again."
38Then the fire of the Lord fell and
burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the
stones and the soil, and also licked up
the water in the trench.
39When all the people saw this, they fell
prostrate and cried, "The Lord -he is
God! The Lord -he is God!"
40Then Elijah commanded them, "Seize
the prophets of Baal. Don't let anyone
get away!" They seized them, and Elijah
had them brought down to the Kishon
Valley and slaughtered there.
41And Elijah said to Ahab, "Go, eat and
drink, for there is the sound of a heavy
rain."
42So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but
Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent
down to the ground and put his face
between his knees.
43"Go and look toward the sea," he told
his servant. And he went up and looked.
"There is nothing there," he said. Seven
times Elijah said, "Go back."
44The seventh time the servant reported,
"A cloud as small as a man's hand is
rising from the sea." So Elijah said, "Go
and tell Ahab, 'Hitch up your chariot and
go down before the rain stops you.' "
45Meanwhile, the sky grew black with
clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain
came on and Ahab rode off to Jezreel.
46The power of the Lord came upon
Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt,
he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to
Jezreel.
19Now Ahab told Jezebel everything
Elijah had done and how he had killed
all the prophets with the sword.
2So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah
to say, "May the gods deal with me, be it
ever so severely, if by this time
tomorrow I do not make your life like
that of one of them."
3Elijah was afraid and ran for his life.
When he came to Beersheba in Judah,
he left his servant there,
4while he himself went a day's journey
into the desert. He came to a broom tree,
sat down under it and prayed that he
might die. "I have had enough, Lord ,"
he said. "Take my life; I am no better
than my ancestors."
5Then he lay down under the tree and
fell asleep. All at once an angel touched
him and said, "Get up and eat."
6He looked around, and there by his
head was a cake of bread baked over
hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and
drank and then lay down again.
7The angel of the Lord came back a
second time and touched him and said,
"Get up and eat, for the journey is too
much for you."
8So he got up and ate and drank.
Strengthened by that food, he traveled
forty days and forty nights until he
reached Horeb, the mountain of God.
9There he went into a cave and spent
the night. And the word of the Lord
came to him: "What are you doing here,
Elijah?"
10He replied, "I have been very zealous
for the Lord God Almighty. The Israelites
have rejected your covenant, broken
down your altars, and put your prophets
to death with the sword. I am the only
one left, and now they are trying to kill
me too."
11The Lord said, "Go out and stand on
the mountain in the presence of the
Lord , for the Lord is about to pass by."
Then a great and powerful wind tore the
mountains apart and shattered the rocks
before the Lord , but the Lord was not in
the wind. After the wind there was an
earthquake, but the Lord was not in the
earthquake.
12After the earthquake came a fire, but
the Lord was not in the fire. And after
the fire came a gentle whisper.
13When Elijah heard it, he pulled his
cloak over his face and went out and
stood at the mouth of the cave. Then a
voice said to him, "What are you doing
here, Elijah?"
14He replied, "I have been very zealous
for the Lord God Almighty. The Israelites
have rejected your covenant, broken
down your altars, and put your prophets
to death with the sword. I am the only
one left, and now they are trying to kill
me too."
15The Lord said to him, "Go back the
way you came, and go to the Desert of
Damascus. When you get there, anoint
Hazael king over Aram.
16Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king
over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of
Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed
you as prophet.
17Jehu will put to death any who escape
the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put
to death any who escape the sword of
Jehu.
18Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israelall
whose knees have not bowed down
to Baal and all whose mouths have not
kissed him."
19So Elijah went from there and found
Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing
with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself
was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went
up to him and threw his cloak around
him.
20Elisha then left his oxen and ran after
Elijah. "Let me kiss my father and
mother good-by," he said, "and then I
will come with you." "Go back," Elijah
replied. "What have I done to you?"
21So Elisha left him and went back. He
took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered
them. He burned the plowing equipment
to cook the meat and gave it to the
people, and they ate. Then he set out to
follow Elijah and became his attendant.
20Now Ben-Hadad king of Aram
mustered his entire army. Accompanied
by thirty-two kings with their horses and
chariots, he went up and besieged
Samaria and attacked it.
2He sent messengers into the city to
Ahab king of Israel, saying, "This is what
Ben-Hadad says:
3'Your silver and gold are mine, and the
best of your wives and children are
mine.' "
4The king of Israel answered, "Just as
you say, my lord the king. I and all I
have are yours."
5The messengers came again and said,
"This is what Ben-Hadad says: 'I sent to
demand your silver and gold, your wives
and your children.
6But about this time tomorrow I am
going to send my officials to search your
palace and the houses of your officials.
They will seize everything you value and
carry it away.' "
7The king of Israel summoned all the
elders of the land and said to them,
"See how this man is looking for trouble!
When he sent for my wives and my
children, my silver and my gold, I did not
refuse him."
8The elders and the people all answered,
"Don't listen to him or agree to his
demands."
9So he replied to Ben-Hadad's
messengers, "Tell my lord the king,
'Your servant will do all you demanded
the first time, but this demand I cannot
meet.' " They left and took the answer
back to Ben-Hadad.
10Then Ben-Hadad sent another
message to Ahab: "May the gods deal
with me, be it ever so severely, if
enough dust remains in Samaria to give
each of my men a handful."
11The king of Israel answered, "Tell him:
'One who puts on his armor should not
boast like one who takes it off.' "
12Ben-Hadad heard this message while
he and the kings were drinking in their
tents, and he ordered his men: "Prepare
to attack." So they prepared to attack
the city.
13Meanwhile a prophet came to Ahab
king of Israel and announced, "This is
what the Lord says: 'Do you see this
vast army? I will give it into your hand
today, and then you will know that I am
the Lord .' "
14"But who will do this?" asked Ahab.
The prophet replied, "This is what the
Lord says: 'The young officers of the
provincial commanders will do it.' " "And
who will start the battle?" he asked. The
prophet answered, "You will."
15So Ahab summoned the young officers
of the provincial commanders, 232 men.
Then he assembled the rest of the
Israelites, 7,000 in all.
16They set out at noon while Ben-Hadad
and the 32 kings allied with him were in
their tents getting drunk.
17The young officers of the provincial
commanders went out first. Now Ben-
Hadad had dispatched scouts, who
reported, "Men are advancing from
Samaria."
18He said, "If they have come out for
peace, take them alive; if they have
come out for war, take them alive."
19The young officers of the provincial
commanders marched out of the city
with the army behind them
20and each one struck down his
opponent. At that, the Arameans fled,
with the Israelites in pursuit. But Ben-
Hadad king of Aram escaped on
horseback with some of his horsemen.
21The king of Israel advanced and
overpowered the horses and chariots
and inflicted heavy losses on the
Arameans.
22Afterward, the prophet came to the
king of Israel and said, "Strengthen your
position and see what must be done,
because next spring the king of Aram
will attack you again."
23Meanwhile, the officials of the king of
Aram advised him, "Their gods are gods
of the hills. That is why they were too
strong for us. But if we fight them on the
plains, surely we will be stronger than
they.
24Do this: Remove all the kings from
their commands and replace them with
other officers.
25You must also raise an army like the
one you lost-horse for horse and chariot
for chariot-so we can fight Israel on the
plains. Then surely we will be stronger
than they." He agreed with them and
acted accordingly.
26The next spring Ben-Hadad mustered
the Arameans and went up to Aphek to
fight against Israel.
27When the Israelites were also
mustered and given provisions, they
marched out to meet them. The
Israelites camped opposite them like
two small flocks of goats, while the
Arameans covered the countryside.
28The man of God came up and told the
king of Israel, "This is what the Lord
says: 'Because the Arameans think the
Lord is a god of the hills and not a god
of the valleys, I will deliver this vast
army into your hands, and you will know
that I am the Lord .' "
29For seven days they camped opposite
each other, and on the seventh day the
battle was joined. The Israelites inflicted
a hundred thousand casualties on the
Aramean foot soldiers in one day.
30The rest of them escaped to the city of
Aphek, where the wall collapsed on
twenty-seven thousand of them. And
Ben-Hadad fled to the city and hid in an
inner room.
31His officials said to him, "Look, we
have heard that the kings of the house
of Israel are merciful. Let us go to the
king of Israel with sackcloth around our
waists and ropes around our heads.
Perhaps he will spare your life."
32Wearing sackcloth around their waists
and ropes around their heads, they went
to the king of Israel and said, "Your
servant Ben-Hadad says: 'Please let me
live.' " The king answered, "Is he still
alive? He is my brother."
33The men took this as a good sign and
were quick to pick up his word. "Yes,
your brother Ben-Hadad!" they said. "Go
and get him," the king said. When Ben-
Hadad came out, Ahab had him come
up into his chariot.
34"I will return the cities my father took
from your father," Ben-Hadad offered.
"You may set up your own market areas
in Damascus, as my father did in
Samaria." Ahab said, "On the basis of a
treaty I will set you free." So he made a
treaty with him, and let him go.
35By the word of the Lord one of the
sons of the prophets said to his
companion, "Strike me with your
weapon," but the man refused.
36So the prophet said, "Because you
have not obeyed the Lord , as soon as
you leave me a lion will kill you." And
after the man went away, a lion found
him and killed him.
37The prophet found another man and
said, "Strike me, please." So the man
struck him and wounded him.
38Then the prophet went and stood by
the road waiting for the king. He
disguised himself with his headband
down over his eyes.
39As the king passed by, the prophet
called out to him, "Your servant went
into the thick of the battle, and someone
came to me with a captive and said,
'Guard this man. If he is missing, it will
be your life for his life, or you must pay a
talent of silver.'
40While your servant was busy here and
there, the man disappeared." "That is
your sentence," the king of Israel said.
"You have pronounced it yourself."
41Then the prophet quickly removed the
headband from his eyes, and the king of
Israel recognized him as one of the
prophets.
42He said to the king, "This is what the
Lord says: 'You have set free a man I
had determined should die. Therefore it
is your life for his life, your people for his
people.' "
43Sullen and angry, the king of Israel
went to his palace in Samaria.
21Some time later there was an
incident involving a vineyard belonging
to Naboth the Jezreelite. The vineyard
was in Jezreel, close to the palace of
Ahab king of Samaria.
2Ahab said to Naboth, "Let me have
your vineyard to use for a vegetable
garden, since it is close to my palace. In
exchange I will give you a better
vineyard or, if you prefer, I will pay you
whatever it is worth."
3But Naboth replied, "The Lord forbid
that I should give you the inheritance of
my fathers."
4So Ahab went home, sullen and angry
because Naboth the Jezreelite had said,
"I will not give you the inheritance of my
fathers." He lay on his bed sulking and
refused to eat.
5His wife Jezebel came in and asked
him, "Why are you so sullen? Why won't
you eat?"
6He answered her, "Because I said to
Naboth the Jezreelite, 'Sell me your
vineyard; or if you prefer, I will give you
another vineyard in its place.' But he
said, 'I will not give you my vineyard.' "
7Jezebel his wife said, "Is this how you
act as king over Israel? Get up and eat!
Cheer up. I'll get you the vineyard of
Naboth the Jezreelite."
8So she wrote letters in Ahab's name,
placed his seal on them, and sent them
to the elders and nobles who lived in
Naboth's city with him.
9In those letters she wrote: "Proclaim a
day of fasting and seat Naboth in a
prominent place among the people.
10But seat two scoundrels opposite him
and have them testify that he has
cursed both God and the king. Then
take him out and stone him to death."
11So the elders and nobles who lived in
Naboth's city did as Jezebel directed in
the letters she had written to them.
12They proclaimed a fast and seated
Naboth in a prominent place among the
people.
13Then two scoundrels came and sat
opposite him and brought charges
against Naboth before the people,
saying, "Naboth has cursed both God
and the king." So they took him outside
the city and stoned him to death.
14Then they sent word to Jezebel:
"Naboth has been stoned and is dead."
15As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth
had been stoned to death, she said to
Ahab, "Get up and take possession of
the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite
that he refused to sell you. He is no
longer alive, but dead."
16When Ahab heard that Naboth was
dead, he got up and went down to take
possession of Naboth's vineyard.
17Then the word of the Lord came to
Elijah the Tishbite:
18"Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel,
who rules in Samaria. He is now in
Naboth's vineyard, where he has gone
to take possession of it.
19Say to him, 'This is what the Lord
says: Have you not murdered a man
and seized his property?' Then say to
him, 'This is what the Lord says: In the
place where dogs licked up Naboth's
blood, dogs will lick up your blood-yes,
yours!' "
20Ahab said to Elijah, "So you have
found me, my enemy!" "I have found
you," he answered, "because you have
sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the
Lord .
21'I am going to bring disaster on you. I
will consume your descendants and cut
off from Ahab every last male in Israelslave
or free.
22I will make your house like that of
Jeroboam son of Nebat and that of
Baasha son of Ahijah, because you
have provoked me to anger and have
caused Israel to sin.'
23"And also concerning Jezebel the Lord
says: 'Dogs will devour Jezebel by the
wall of Jezreel.'
24"Dogs will eat those belonging to Ahab
who die in the city, and the birds of the
air will feed on those who die in the
country."
25(There was never a man like Ahab,
who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of
the Lord , urged on by Jezebel his wife.
26He behaved in the vilest manner by
going after idols, like the Amorites the
Lord drove out before Israel.)
27When Ahab heard these words, he
tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and
fasted. He lay in sackcloth and went
around meekly.
28Then the word of the Lord came to
Elijah the Tishbite:
29"Have you noticed how Ahab has
humbled himself before me? Because
he has humbled himself, I will not bring
this disaster in his day, but I will bring it
on his house in the days of his son."
22For three years there was no war
between Aram and Israel.
2But in the third year Jehoshaphat king
of Judah went down to see the king of
Israel.
3The king of Israel had said to his
officials, "Don't you know that Ramoth
Gilead belongs to us and yet we are
doing nothing to retake it from the king
of Aram?"
4So he asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you go
with me to fight against Ramoth
Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied to the king
of Israel, "I am as you are, my people as
your people, my horses as your horses."
5But Jehoshaphat also said to the king
of Israel, "First seek the counsel of the
Lord ."
6So the king of Israel brought together
the prophets-about four hundred menand
asked them, "Shall I go to war
against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I
refrain?" "Go," they answered, "for the
Lord will give it into the king's hand."
7But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not a
prophet of the Lord here whom we can
inquire of?"
8The king of Israel answered
Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man
through whom we can inquire of the
Lord , but I hate him because he never
prophesies anything good about me, but
always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah."
"The king should not say that,"
Jehoshaphat replied.
9So the king of Israel called one of his
officials and said, "Bring Micaiah son of
Imlah at once."
10Dressed in their royal robes, the king
of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah
were sitting on their thrones at the
threshing floor by the entrance of the
gate of Samaria, with all the prophets
prophesying before them.
11Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had
made iron horns and he declared, "This
is what the Lord says: 'With these you
will gore the Arameans until they are
destroyed.' "
12All the other prophets were
prophesying the same thing. "Attack
Ramoth Gilead and be victorious," they
said, "for the Lord will give it into the
king's hand."
13The messenger who had gone to
summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, as
one man the other prophets are
predicting success for the king. Let your
word agree with theirs, and speak
favorably."
14But Micaiah said, "As surely as the
Lord lives, I can tell him only what the
Lord tells me."
15When he arrived, the king asked him,
"Micaiah, shall we go to war against
Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?"
"Attack and be victorious," he answered,
"for the Lord will give it into the king's
hand."
16The king said to him, "How many times
must I make you swear to tell me
nothing but the truth in the name of the
Lord ?"
17Then Micaiah answered, "I saw all
Israel scattered on the hills like sheep
without a shepherd, and the Lord said,
'These people have no master. Let each
one go home in peace.' "
18The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat,
"Didn't I tell you that he never
prophesies anything good about me, but
only bad?"
19Micaiah continued, "Therefore hear the
word of the Lord : I saw the Lord sitting
on his throne with all the host of heaven
standing around him on his right and on
his left.
20And the Lord said, 'Who will entice
Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and
going to his death there?' "One
suggested this, and another that.
21Finally, a spirit came forward, stood
before the Lord and said, 'I will entice
him.'
22" 'By what means?' the Lord asked. " 'I
will go out and be a lying spirit in the
mouths of all his prophets,' he said. "
'You will succeed in enticing him,' said
the Lord . 'Go and do it.'
23"So now the Lord has put a lying spirit
in the mouths of all these prophets of
yours. The Lord has decreed disaster
for you."
24Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went
up and slapped Micaiah in the face.
"Which way did the spirit from the Lord
go when he went from me to speak to
you?" he asked.
25Micaiah replied, "You will find out on
the day you go to hide in an inner room."
26The king of Israel then ordered, "Take
Micaiah and send him back to Amon the
ruler of the city and to Joash the king's
son
27and say, 'This is what the king says:
Put this fellow in prison and give him
nothing but bread and water until I
return safely.' "
28Micaiah declared, "If you ever return
safely, the Lord has not spoken through
me." Then he added, "Mark my words,
all you people!"
29So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat
king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.
30The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat,
"I will enter the battle in disguise, but
you wear your royal robes." So the king
of Israel disguised himself and went into
battle.
31Now the king of Aram had ordered his
thirty-two chariot commanders, "Do not
fight with anyone, small or great, except
the king of Israel."
32When the chariot commanders saw
Jehoshaphat, they thought, "Surely this
is the king of Israel." So they turned to
attack him, but when Jehoshaphat cried
out,
33the chariot commanders saw that he
was not the king of Israel and stopped
pursuing him.
34But someone drew his bow at random
and hit the king of Israel between the
sections of his armor. The king told his
chariot driver, "Wheel around and get
me out of the fighting. I've been
wounded."
35All day long the battle raged, and the
king was propped up in his chariot
facing the Arameans. The blood from
his wound ran onto the floor of the
chariot, and that evening he died.
36As the sun was setting, a cry spread
through the army: "Every man to his
town; everyone to his land!"
37So the king died and was brought to
Samaria, and they buried him there.
38They washed the chariot at a pool in
Samaria (where the prostitutes bathed),
and the dogs licked up his blood, as the
word of the Lord had declared.
39As for the other events of Ahab's reign,
including all he did, the palace he built
and inlaid with ivory, and the cities he
fortified, are they not written in the book
of the annals of the kings of Israel?
40Ahab rested with his fathers. And
Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.
41Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king
of Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king
of Israel.
42Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old
when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His
mother's name was Azubah daughter of
Shilhi.
43In everything he walked in the ways of
his father Asa and did not stray from
them; he did what was right in the eyes
of the Lord . The high places, however,
were not removed, and the people
continued to offer sacrifices and burn
incense there.
44Jehoshaphat was also at peace with
the king of Israel.
45As for the other events of
Jehoshaphat's reign, the things he
achieved and his military exploits, are
they not written in the book of the annals
of the kings of Judah?
46He rid the land of the rest of the male
shrine prostitutes who remained there
even after the reign of his father Asa.
47There was then no king in Edom; a
deputy ruled.
48Now Jehoshaphat built a fleet of
trading ships to go to Ophir for gold, but
they never set sail-they were wrecked at
Ezion Geber.
49At that time Ahaziah son of Ahab said
to Jehoshaphat, "Let my men sail with
your men," but Jehoshaphat refused.
50Then Jehoshaphat rested with his
fathers and was buried with them in the
city of David his father. And Jehoram his
son succeeded him.
51Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of
Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth
year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and
he reigned over Israel two years.
52He did evil in the eyes of the Lord ,
because he walked in the ways of his
father and mother and in the ways of
Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused
Israel to sin.
53He served and worshiped Baal and
provoked the Lord , the God of Israel, to
anger, just as his father had done.
2nd Kings
1After Ahab's death, Moab rebelled
against Israel.
2Now Ahaziah had fallen through the
lattice of his upper room in Samaria and
injured himself. So he sent messengers,
saying to them, "Go and consult Baal-
Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will
recover from this injury."
3But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah
the Tishbite, "Go up and meet the
messengers of the king of Samaria and
ask them, 'Is it because there is no God
in Israel that you are going off to consult
Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?'
4Therefore this is what the Lord says:
'You will not leave the bed you are lying
on. You will certainly die!' " So Elijah
went.
5When the messengers returned to the
king, he asked them, "Why have you
come back?"
6"A man came to meet us," they replied.
"And he said to us, 'Go back to the king
who sent you and tell him, "This is what
the Lord says: Is it because there is no
God in Israel that you are sending men
to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of
Ekron? Therefore you will not leave the
bed you are lying on. You will certainly
die!" ' "
7The king asked them, "What kind of
man was it who came to meet you and
told you this?"
8They replied, "He was a man with a
garment of hair and with a leather belt
around his waist." The king said, "That
was Elijah the Tishbite."
9Then he sent to Elijah a captain with his
company of fifty men. The captain went
up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top
of a hill, and said to him, "Man of God,
the king says, 'Come down!' "
10Elijah answered the captain, "If I am a
man of God, may fire come down from
heaven and consume you and your fifty
men!" Then fire fell from heaven and
consumed the captain and his men.
11At this the king sent to Elijah another
captain with his fifty men. The captain
said to him, "Man of God, this is what
the king says, 'Come down at once!' "
12"If I am a man of God," Elijah replied,
"may fire come down from heaven and
consume you and your fifty men!" Then
the fire of God fell from heaven and
consumed him and his fifty men.
13So the king sent a third captain with
his fifty men. This third captain went up
and fell on his knees before Elijah. "Man
of God," he begged, "please have
respect for my life and the lives of these
fifty men, your servants!
14See, fire has fallen from heaven and
consumed the first two captains and all
their men. But now have respect for my
life!"
15The angel of the Lord said to Elijah,
"Go down with him; do not be afraid of
him." So Elijah got up and went down
with him to the king.
16He told the king, "This is what the Lord
says: Is it because there is no God in
Israel for you to consult that you have
sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub,
the god of Ekron? Because you have
done this, you will never leave the bed
you are lying on. You will certainly die!"
17So he died, according to the word of
the Lord that Elijah had spoken.
Because Ahaziah had no son, Joram
succeeded him as king in the second
year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat
king of Judah.
18As for all the other events of Ahaziah's
reign, and what he did, are they not
written in the book of the annals of the
kings of Israel?
2When the Lord was about to take
Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah
and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.
2Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here; the
Lord has sent me to Bethel." But Elisha
said, "As surely as the Lord lives and as
you live, I will not leave you." So they
went down to Bethel.
3The company of the prophets at Bethel
came out to Elisha and asked, "Do you
know that the Lord is going to take your
master from you today?" "Yes, I know,"
Elisha replied, "but do not speak of it."
4Then Elijah said to him, "Stay here,
Elisha; the Lord has sent me to Jericho."
And he replied, "As surely as the Lord
lives and as you live, I will not leave
you." So they went to Jericho.
5The company of the prophets at Jericho
went up to Elisha and asked him, "Do
you know that the Lord is going to take
your master from you today?" "Yes, I
know," he replied, "but do not speak of
it."
6Then Elijah said to him, "Stay here; the
Lord has sent me to the Jordan." And he
replied, "As surely as the Lord lives and
as you live, I will not leave you." So the
two of them walked on.
7Fifty men of the company of the
prophets went and stood at a distance,
facing the place where Elijah and Elisha
had stopped at the Jordan.
8Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up and
struck the water with it. The water
divided to the right and to the left, and
the two of them crossed over on dry
ground.
9When they had crossed, Elijah said to
Elisha, "Tell me, what can I do for you
before I am taken from you?" "Let me
inherit a double portion of your spirit,"
Elisha replied.
10"You have asked a difficult thing,"
Elijah said, "yet if you see me when I am
taken from you, it will be yoursotherwise
not."
11As they were walking along and talking
together, suddenly a chariot of fire and
horses of fire appeared and separated
the two of them, and Elijah went up to
heaven in a whirlwind.
12Elisha saw this and cried out, "My
father! My father! The chariots and
horsemen of Israel!" And Elisha saw him
no more. Then he took hold of his own
clothes and tore them apart.
13He picked up the cloak that had fallen
from Elijah and went back and stood on
the bank of the Jordan.
14Then he took the cloak that had fallen
from him and struck the water with it.
"Where now is the Lord , the God of
Elijah?" he asked. When he struck the
water, it divided to the right and to the
left, and he crossed over.
15The company of the prophets from
Jericho, who were watching, said, "The
spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha." And
they went to meet him and bowed to the
ground before him.
16"Look," they said, "we your servants
have fifty able men. Let them go and
look for your master. Perhaps the Spirit
of the Lord has picked him up and set
him down on some mountain or in some
valley." "No," Elisha replied, "do not
send them."
17But they persisted until he was too
ashamed to refuse. So he said, "Send
them." And they sent fifty men, who
searched for three days but did not find
him.
18When they returned to Elisha, who
was staying in Jericho, he said to them,
"Didn't I tell you not to go?"
19The men of the city said to Elisha,
"Look, our lord, this town is well situated,
as you can see, but the water is bad and
the land is unproductive."
20"Bring me a new bowl," he said, "and
put salt in it." So they brought it to him.
21Then he went out to the spring and
threw the salt into it, saying, "This is
what the Lord says: 'I have healed this
water. Never again will it cause death or
make the land unproductive.' "
22And the water has remained
wholesome to this day, according to the
word Elisha had spoken.
23From there Elisha went up to Bethel.
As he was walking along the road, some
youths came out of the town and jeered
at him. "Go on up, you baldhead!" they
said. "Go on up, you baldhead!"
24He turned around, looked at them and
called down a curse on them in the
name of the Lord . Then two bears
came out of the woods and mauled
forty-two of the youths.
25And he went on to Mount Carmel and
from there returned to Samaria.
3Joram son of Ahab became king of
Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year
of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he
reigned twelve years.
2He did evil in the eyes of the Lord , but
not as his father and mother had done.
He got rid of the sacred stone of Baal
that his father had made.
3Nevertheless he clung to the sins of
Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had
caused Israel to commit; he did not turn
away from them.
4Now Mesha king of Moab raised sheep,
and he had to supply the king of Israel
with a hundred thousand lambs and with
the wool of a hundred thousand rams.
5But after Ahab died, the king of Moab
rebelled against the king of Israel.
6So at that time King Joram set out from
Samaria and mobilized all Israel.
7He also sent this message to
Jehoshaphat king of Judah: "The king of
Moab has rebelled against me. Will you
go with me to fight against Moab?" "I will
go with you," he replied. "I am as you
are, my people as your people, my
horses as your horses."
8"By what route shall we attack?" he
asked. "Through the Desert of Edom,"
he answered.
9So the king of Israel set out with the
king of Judah and the king of Edom.
After a roundabout march of seven days,
the army had no more water for
themselves or for the animals with them.
10"What!" exclaimed the king of Israel.
"Has the Lord called us three kings
together only to hand us over to Moab?"
11But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there no
prophet of the Lord here, that we may
inquire of the Lord through him?" An
officer of the king of Israel answered,
"Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used
to pour water on the hands of Elijah. "
12Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the
Lord is with him." So the king of Israel
and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom
went down to him.
13Elisha said to the king of Israel, "What
do we have to do with each other? Go to
the prophets of your father and the
prophets of your mother." "No," the king
of Israel answered, "because it was the
Lord who called us three kings together
to hand us over to Moab."
14Elisha said, "As surely as the Lord
Almighty lives, whom I serve, if I did not
have respect for the presence of
Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not
look at you or even notice you.
15But now bring me a harpist." While the
harpist was playing, the hand of the
Lord came upon Elisha
16and he said, "This is what the Lord
says: Make this valley full of ditches.
17For this is what the Lord says: You will
see neither wind nor rain, yet this valley
will be filled with water, and you, your
cattle and your other animals will drink.
18This is an easy thing in the eyes of the
Lord ; he will also hand Moab over to
you.
19You will overthrow every fortified city
and every major town. You will cut down
every good tree, stop up all the springs,
and ruin every good field with stones."
20The next morning, about the time for
offering the sacrifice, there it was-water
flowing from the direction of Edom! And
the land was filled with water.
21Now all the Moabites had heard that
the kings had come to fight against
them; so every man, young and old,
who could bear arms was called up and
stationed on the border.
22When they got up early in the morning,
the sun was shining on the water. To the
Moabites across the way, the water
looked red-like blood.
23"That's blood!" they said. "Those kings
must have fought and slaughtered each
other. Now to the plunder, Moab!"
24But when the Moabites came to the
camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up
and fought them until they fled. And the
Israelites invaded the land and
slaughtered the Moabites.
25They destroyed the towns, and each
man threw a stone on every good field
until it was covered. They stopped up all
the springs and cut down every good
tree. Only Kir Hareseth was left with its
stones in place, but men armed with
slings surrounded it and attacked it as
well.
26When the king of Moab saw that the
battle had gone against him, he took
with him seven hundred swordsmen to
break through to the king of Edom, but
they failed.
27Then he took his firstborn son, who
was to succeed him as king, and offered
him as a sacrifice on the city wall. The
fury against Israel was great; they
withdrew and returned to their own land.
4The wife of a man from the company
of the prophets cried out to Elisha, "Your
servant my husband is dead, and you
know that he revered the Lord . But now
his creditor is coming to take my two
boys as his slaves."
2Elisha replied to her, "How can I help
you? Tell me, what do you have in your
house?" "Your servant has nothing there
at all," she said, "except a little oil."
3Elisha said, "Go around and ask all
your neighbors for empty jars. Don't ask
for just a few.
4Then go inside and shut the door
behind you and your sons. Pour oil into
all the jars, and as each is filled, put it to
one side."
5She left him and afterward shut the
door behind her and her sons. They
brought the jars to her and she kept
pouring.
6When all the jars were full, she said to
her son, "Bring me another one." But he
replied, "There is not a jar left." Then the
oil stopped flowing.
7She went and told the man of God, and
he said, "Go, sell the oil and pay your
debts. You and your sons can live on
what is left."
8One day Elisha went to Shunem. And a
well-to-do woman was there, who urged
him to stay for a meal. So whenever he
came by, he stopped there to eat.
9She said to her husband, "I know that
this man who often comes our way is a
holy man of God.
10Let's make a small room on the roof
and put in it a bed and a table, a chair
and a lamp for him. Then he can stay
there whenever he comes to us."
11One day when Elisha came, he went
up to his room and lay down there.
12He said to his servant Gehazi, "Call
the Shunammite." So he called her, and
she stood before him.
13Elisha said to him, "Tell her, 'You have
gone to all this trouble for us. Now what
can be done for you? Can we speak on
your behalf to the king or the
commander of the army?' " She replied,
"I have a home among my own people."
14"What can be done for her?" Elisha
asked. Gehazi said, "Well, she has no
son and her husband is old."
15Then Elisha said, "Call her." So he
called her, and she stood in the doorway.
16"About this time next year," Elisha said,
"you will hold a son in your arms." "No,
my lord," she objected. "Don't mislead
your servant, O man of God!"
17But the woman became pregnant, and
the next year about that same time she
gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had
told her.
18The child grew, and one day he went
out to his father, who was with the
reapers.
19"My head! My head!" he said to his
father. His father told a servant, "Carry
him to his mother."
20After the servant had lifted him up and
carried him to his mother, the boy sat on
her lap until noon, and then he died.
21She went up and laid him on the bed
of the man of God, then shut the door
and went out.
22She called her husband and said,
"Please send me one of the servants
and a donkey so I can go to the man of
God quickly and return."
23"Why go to him today?" he asked. "It's
not the New Moon or the Sabbath." "It's
all right," she said.
24She saddled the donkey and said to
her servant, "Lead on; don't slow down
for me unless I tell you."
25So she set out and came to the man of
God at Mount Carmel. When he saw her
in the distance, the man of God said to
his servant Gehazi, "Look! There's the
Shunammite!
26Run to meet her and ask her, 'Are you
all right? Is your husband all right? Is
your child all right?' " "Everything is all
right," she said.
27When she reached the man of God at
the mountain, she took hold of his feet.
Gehazi came over to push her away, but
the man of God said, "Leave her alone!
She is in bitter distress, but the Lord has
hidden it from me and has not told me
why."
28"Did I ask you for a son, my lord?" she
said. "Didn't I tell you, 'Don't raise my
hopes'?"
29Elisha said to Gehazi, "Tuck your
cloak into your belt, take my staff in your
hand and run. If you meet anyone, do
not greet him, and if anyone greets you,
do not answer. Lay my staff on the boy's
face."
30But the child's mother said, "As surely
as the Lord lives and as you live, I will
not leave you." So he got up and
followed her.
31Gehazi went on ahead and laid the
staff on the boy's face, but there was no
sound or response. So Gehazi went
back to meet Elisha and told him, "The
boy has not awakened."
32When Elisha reached the house, there
was the boy lying dead on his couch.
33He went in, shut the door on the two of
them and prayed to the Lord .
34Then he got on the bed and lay upon
the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes,
hands to hands. As he stretched himself
out upon him, the boy's body grew warm.
35Elisha turned away and walked back
and forth in the room and then got on
the bed and stretched out upon him
once more. The boy sneezed seven
times and opened his eyes.
36Elisha summoned Gehazi and said,
"Call the Shunammite." And he did.
When she came, he said, "Take your
son."
37She came in, fell at his feet and bowed
to the ground. Then she took her son
and went out.
38Elisha returned to Gilgal and there was
a famine in that region. While the
company of the prophets was meeting
with him, he said to his servant, "Put on
the large pot and cook some stew for
these men."
39One of them went out into the fields to
gather herbs and found a wild vine. He
gathered some of its gourds and filled
the fold of his cloak. When he returned,
he cut them up into the pot of stew,
though no one knew what they were.
40The stew was poured out for the men,
but as they began to eat it, they cried
out, "O man of God, there is death in the
pot!" And they could not eat it.
41Elisha said, "Get some flour." He put it
into the pot and said, "Serve it to the
people to eat." And there was nothing
harmful in the pot.
42A man came from Baal Shalishah,
bringing the man of God twenty loaves
of barley bread baked from the first ripe
grain, along with some heads of new
grain. "Give it to the people to eat,"
Elisha said.
43"How can I set this before a hundred
men?" his servant asked. But Elisha
answered, "Give it to the people to eat.
For this is what the Lord says: 'They will
eat and have some left over.' "
44Then he set it before them, and they
ate and had some left over, according to
the word of the Lord .
5Now Naaman was commander of the
army of the king of Aram. He was a
great man in the sight of his master and
highly regarded, because through him
the Lord had given victory to Aram. He
was a valiant soldier, but he had leprosy.
2Now bands from Aram had gone out
and had taken captive a young girl from
Israel, and she served Naaman's wife.
3She said to her mistress, "If only my
master would see the prophet who is in
Samaria! He would cure him of his
leprosy."
4Naaman went to his master and told
him what the girl from Israel had said.
5"By all means, go," the king of Aram
replied. "I will send a letter to the king of
Israel." So Naaman left, taking with him
ten talents of silver, six thousand
shekels of gold and ten sets of clothing.
6The letter that he took to the king of
Israel read: "With this letter I am sending
my servant Naaman to you so that you
may cure him of his leprosy."
7As soon as the king of Israel read the
letter, he tore his robes and said, "Am I
God? Can I kill and bring back to life?
Why does this fellow send someone to
me to be cured of his leprosy? See how
he is trying to pick a quarrel with me!"
8When Elisha the man of God heard that
the king of Israel had torn his robes, he
sent him this message: "Why have you
torn your robes? Have the man come to
me and he will know that there is a
prophet in Israel."
9So Naaman went with his horses and
chariots and stopped at the door of
Elisha's house.
10Elisha sent a messenger to say to him,
"Go, wash yourself seven times in the
Jordan, and your flesh will be restored
and you will be cleansed."
11But Naaman went away angry and
said, "I thought that he would surely
come out to me and stand and call on
the name of the Lord his God, wave his
hand over the spot and cure me of my
leprosy.
12Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers
of Damascus, better than any of the
waters of Israel? Couldn't I wash in them
and be cleansed?" So he turned and
went off in a rage.
13Naaman's servants went to him and
said, "My father, if the prophet had told
you to do some great thing, would you
not have done it? How much more, then,
when he tells you, 'Wash and be
cleansed'!"
14So he went down and dipped himself
in the Jordan seven times, as the man
of God had told him, and his flesh was
restored and became clean like that of a
young boy.
15Then Naaman and all his attendants
went back to the man of God. He stood
before him and said, "Now I know that
there is no God in all the world except in
Israel. Please accept now a gift from
your servant."
16The prophet answered, "As surely as
the Lord lives, whom I serve, I will not
accept a thing." And even though
Naaman urged him, he refused.
17"If you will not," said Naaman, "please
let me, your servant, be given as much
earth as a pair of mules can carry, for
your servant will never again make burnt
offerings and sacrifices to any other god
but the Lord .
18But may the Lord forgive your servant
for this one thing: When my master
enters the temple of Rimmon to bow
down and he is leaning on my arm and I
bow there also-when I bow down in the
temple of Rimmon, may the Lord forgive
your servant for this."
19"Go in peace," Elisha said. After
Naaman had traveled some distance,
20Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man
of God, said to himself, "My master was
too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by
not accepting from him what he brought.
As surely as the Lord lives, I will run
after him and get something from him."
21So Gehazi hurried after Naaman.
When Naaman saw him running toward
him, he got down from the chariot to
meet him. "Is everything all right?" he
asked.
22"Everything is all right," Gehazi
answered. "My master sent me to say,
'Two young men from the company of
the prophets have just come to me from
the hill country of Ephraim. Please give
them a talent of silver and two sets of
clothing.' "
23"By all means, take two talents," said
Naaman. He urged Gehazi to accept
them, and then tied up the two talents of
silver in two bags, with two sets of
clothing. He gave them to two of his
servants, and they carried them ahead
of Gehazi.
24When Gehazi came to the hill, he took
the things from the servants and put
them away in the house. He sent the
men away and they left.
25Then he went in and stood before his
master Elisha. "Where have you been,
Gehazi?" Elisha asked. "Your servant
didn't go anywhere," Gehazi answered.
26But Elisha said to him, "Was not my
spirit with you when the man got down
from his chariot to meet you? Is this the
time to take money, or to accept clothes,
olive groves, vineyards, flocks, herds, or
menservants and maidservants?
27Naaman's leprosy will cling to you and
to your descendants forever." Then
Gehazi went from Elisha's presence and
he was leprous, as white as snow.
6The company of the prophets said to
Elisha, "Look, the place where we meet
with you is too small for us.
2Let us go to the Jordan, where each of
us can get a pole; and let us build a
place there for us to live." And he said,
"Go."
3Then one of them said, "Won't you
please come with your servants?" "I
will," Elisha replied.
4And he went with them. They went to
the Jordan and began to cut down trees.
5As one of them was cutting down a tree,
the iron axhead fell into the water. "Oh,
my lord," he cried out, "it was borrowed!"
6The man of God asked, "Where did it
fall?" When he showed him the place,
Elisha cut a stick and threw it there, and
made the iron float.
7"Lift it out," he said. Then the man
reached out his hand and took it.
8Now the king of Aram was at war with
Israel. After conferring with his officers,
he said, "I will set up my camp in such
and such a place."
9The man of God sent word to the king
of Israel: "Beware of passing that place,
because the Arameans are going down
there."
10So the king of Israel checked on the
place indicated by the man of God. Time
and again Elisha warned the king, so
that he was on his guard in such places.
11This enraged the king of Aram. He
summoned his officers and demanded
of them, "Will you not tell me which of us
is on the side of the king of Israel?"
12"None of us, my lord the king," said
one of his officers, "but Elisha, the
prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of
Israel the very words you speak in your
bedroom."
13"Go, find out where he is," the king
ordered, "so I can send men and
capture him." The report came back:
"He is in Dothan."
14Then he sent horses and chariots and
a strong force there. They went by night
and surrounded the city.
15When the servant of the man of God
got up and went out early the next
morning, an army with horses and
chariots had surrounded the city. "Oh,
my lord, what shall we do?" the servant
asked.
16"Don't be afraid," the prophet
answered. "Those who are with us are
more than those who are with them."
17And Elisha prayed, "O Lord , open his
eyes so he may see." Then the Lord
opened the servant's eyes, and he
looked and saw the hills full of horses
and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
18As the enemy came down toward him,
Elisha prayed to the Lord , "Strike these
people with blindness." So he struck
them with blindness, as Elisha had
asked.
19Elisha told them, "This is not the road
and this is not the city. Follow me, and I
will lead you to the man you are looking
for." And he led them to Samaria.
20After they entered the city, Elisha said,
"Lord , open the eyes of these men so
they can see." Then the Lord opened
their eyes and they looked, and there
they were, inside Samaria.
21When the king of Israel saw them, he
asked Elisha, "Shall I kill them, my
father? Shall I kill them?"
22"Do not kill them," he answered.
"Would you kill men you have captured
with your own sword or bow? Set food
and water before them so that they may
eat and drink and then go back to their
master."
23So he prepared a great feast for them,
and after they had finished eating and
drinking, he sent them away, and they
returned to their master. So the bands
from Aram stopped raiding Israel's
territory.
24Some time later, Ben-Hadad king of
Aram mobilized his entire army and
marched up and laid siege to Samaria.
25There was a great famine in the city;
the siege lasted so long that a donkey's
head sold for eighty shekels of silver,
and a quarter of a cab of seed pods for
five shekels.
26As the king of Israel was passing by
on the wall, a woman cried to him, "Help
me, my lord the king!"
27The king replied, "If the Lord does not
help you, where can I get help for you?
From the threshing floor? From the
winepress?"
28Then he asked her, "What's the
matter?" She answered, "This woman
said to me, 'Give up your son so we may
eat him today, and tomorrow we'll eat
my son.'
29So we cooked my son and ate him.
The next day I said to her, 'Give up your
son so we may eat him,' but she had
hidden him."
30When the king heard the woman's
words, he tore his robes. As he went
along the wall, the people looked, and
there, underneath, he had sackcloth on
his body.
31He said, "May God deal with me, be it
ever so severely, if the head of Elisha
son of Shaphat remains on his
shoulders today!"
32Now Elisha was sitting in his house,
and the elders were sitting with him. The
king sent a messenger ahead, but
before he arrived, Elisha said to the
elders, "Don't you see how this murderer
is sending someone to cut off my head?
Look, when the messenger comes, shut
the door and hold it shut against him. Is
not the sound of his master's footsteps
behind him?"
33While he was still talking to them, the
messenger came down to him. And the
king said, "This disaster is from the
Lord . Why should I wait for the Lord any
longer?"
7Elisha said, "Hear the word of the
Lord . This is what the Lord says: About
this time tomorrow, a seah of flour will
sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley
for a shekel at the gate of Samaria."
2The officer on whose arm the king was
leaning said to the man of God, "Look,
even if the Lord should open the
floodgates of the heavens, could this
happen?" "You will see it with your own
eyes," answered Elisha, "but you will not
eat any of it!"
3Now there were four men with leprosy
at the entrance of the city gate. They
said to each other, "Why stay here until
we die?
4If we say, 'We'll go into the city'-the
famine is there, and we will die. And if
we stay here, we will die. So let's go
over to the camp of the Arameans and
surrender. If they spare us, we live; if
they kill us, then we die."
5At dusk they got up and went to the
camp of the Arameans. When they
reached the edge of the camp, not a
man was there,
6for the Lord had caused the Arameans
to hear the sound of chariots and horses
and a great army, so that they said to
one another, "Look, the king of Israel
has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings
to attack us!"
7So they got up and fled in the dusk and
abandoned their tents and their horses
and donkeys. They left the camp as it
was and ran for their lives.
8The men who had leprosy reached the
edge of the camp and entered one of
the tents. They ate and drank, and
carried away silver, gold and clothes,
and went off and hid them. They
returned and entered another tent and
took some things from it and hid them
also.
9Then they said to each other, "We're
not doing right. This is a day of good
news and we are keeping it to ourselves.
If we wait until daylight, punishment will
overtake us. Let's go at once and report
this to the royal palace."
10So they went and called out to the city
gatekeepers and told them, "We went
into the Aramean camp and not a man
was there-not a sound of anyone-only
tethered horses and donkeys, and the
tents left just as they were."
11The gatekeepers shouted the news,
and it was reported within the palace.
12The king got up in the night and said to
his officers, "I will tell you what the
Arameans have done to us. They know
we are starving; so they have left the
camp to hide in the countryside, thinking,
'They will surely come out, and then we
will take them alive and get into the city.'
"
13One of his officers answered, "Have
some men take five of the horses that
are left in the city. Their plight will be like
that of all the Israelites left here-yes,
they will only be like all these Israelites
who are doomed. So let us send them to
find out what happened."
14So they selected two chariots with
their horses, and the king sent them
after the Aramean army. He
commanded the drivers, "Go and find
out what has happened."
15They followed them as far as the
Jordan, and they found the whole road
strewn with the clothing and equipment
the Arameans had thrown away in their
headlong flight. So the messengers
returned and reported to the king.
16Then the people went out and
plundered the camp of the Arameans.
So a seah of flour sold for a shekel, and
two seahs of barley sold for a shekel, as
the Lord had said.
17Now the king had put the officer on
whose arm he leaned in charge of the
gate, and the people trampled him in the
gateway, and he died, just as the man of
God had foretold when the king came
down to his house.
18It happened as the man of God had
said to the king: "About this time
tomorrow, a seah of flour will sell for a
shekel and two seahs of barley for a
shekel at the gate of Samaria."
19The officer had said to the man of God,
"Look, even if the Lord should open the
floodgates of the heavens, could this
happen?" The man of God had replied,
"You will see it with your own eyes, but
you will not eat any of it!"
20And that is exactly what happened to
him, for the people trampled him in the
gateway, and he died.
8Now Elisha had said to the woman
whose son he had restored to life, "Go
away with your family and stay for a
while wherever you can, because the
Lord has decreed a famine in the land
that will last seven years."
2The woman proceeded to do as the
man of God said. She and her family
went away and stayed in the land of the
Philistines seven years.
3At the end of the seven years she came
back from the land of the Philistines and
went to the king to beg for her house
and land.
4The king was talking to Gehazi, the
servant of the man of God, and had said,
"Tell me about all the great things Elisha
has done."
5Just as Gehazi was telling the king how
Elisha had restored the dead to life, the
woman whose son Elisha had brought
back to life came to beg the king for her
house and land. Gehazi said, "This is
the woman, my lord the king, and this is
her son whom Elisha restored to life."
6The king asked the woman about it,
and she told him. Then he assigned an
official to her case and said to him,
"Give back everything that belonged to
her, including all the income from her
land from the day she left the country
until now."
7Elisha went to Damascus, and Ben-
Hadad king of Aram was ill. When the
king was told, "The man of God has
come all the way up here,"
8he said to Hazael, "Take a gift with you
and go to meet the man of God. Consult
the Lord through him; ask him, 'Will I
recover from this illness?' "
9Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with
him as a gift forty camel-loads of all the
finest wares of Damascus. He went in
and stood before him, and said, "Your
son Ben-Hadad king of Aram has sent
me to ask, 'Will I recover from this
illness?' "
10Elisha answered, "Go and say to him,
'You will certainly recover'; but the Lord
has revealed to me that he will in fact
die."
11He stared at him with a fixed gaze until
Hazael felt ashamed. Then the man of
God began to weep.
12"Why is my lord weeping?" asked
Hazael. "Because I know the harm you
will do to the Israelites," he answered.
"You will set fire to their fortified places,
kill their young men with the sword,
dash their little children to the ground,
and rip open their pregnant women."
13Hazael said, "How could your servant,
a mere dog, accomplish such a feat?"
"The Lord has shown me that you will
become king of Aram," answered Elisha.
14Then Hazael left Elisha and returned
to his master. When Ben-Hadad asked,
"What did Elisha say to you?" Hazael
replied, "He told me that you would
certainly recover."
15But the next day he took a thick cloth,
soaked it in water and spread it over the
king's face, so that he died. Then
Hazael succeeded him as king.
16In the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab
king of Israel, when Jehoshaphat was
king of Judah, Jehoram son of
Jehoshaphat began his reign as king of
Judah.
17He was thirty-two years old when he
became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem eight years.
18He walked in the ways of the kings of
Israel, as the house of Ahab had done,
for he married a daughter of Ahab. He
did evil in the eyes of the Lord .
19Nevertheless, for the sake of his
servant David, the Lord was not willing
to destroy Judah. He had promised to
maintain a lamp for David and his
descendants forever.
20In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled
against Judah and set up its own king.
21So Jehoram went to Zair with all his
chariots. The Edomites surrounded him
and his chariot commanders, but he
rose up and broke through by night; his
army, however, fled back home.
22To this day Edom has been in
rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted
at the same time.
23As for the other events of Jehoram's
reign, and all he did, are they not written
in the book of the annals of the kings of
Judah?
24Jehoram rested with his fathers and
was buried with them in the City of
David. And Ahaziah his son succeeded
him as king.
25In the twelfth year of Joram son of
Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah son of
Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.
26Ahaziah was twenty-two years old
when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem one year. His mother's
name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of
Omri king of Israel.
27He walked in the ways of the house of
Ahab and did evil in the eyes of the
Lord , as the house of Ahab had done,
for he was related by marriage to Ahab's
family.
28Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab
to war against Hazael king of Aram at
Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans
wounded Joram;
29so King Joram returned to Jezreel to
recover from the wounds the Arameans
had inflicted on him at Ramoth in his
battle with Hazael king of Aram. Then
Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah
went down to Jezreel to see Joram son
of Ahab, because he had been wounded.
9The prophet Elisha summoned a
man from the company of the prophets
and said to him, "Tuck your cloak into
your belt, take this flask of oil with you
and go to Ramoth Gilead.
2When you get there, look for Jehu son
of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go
to him, get him away from his
companions and take him into an inner
room.
3Then take the flask and pour the oil on
his head and declare, 'This is what the
Lord says: I anoint you king over Israel.'
Then open the door and run; don't
delay!"
4So the young man, the prophet, went to
Ramoth Gilead.
5When he arrived, he found the army
officers sitting together. "I have a
message for you, commander," he said.
"For which of us?" asked Jehu. "For you,
commander," he replied.
6Jehu got up and went into the house.
Then the prophet poured the oil on
Jehu's head and declared, "This is what
the Lord , the God of Israel, says: 'I
anoint you king over the Lord 's people
Israel.
7You are to destroy the house of Ahab
your master, and I will avenge the blood
of my servants the prophets and the
blood of all the Lord 's servants shed by
Jezebel.
8The whole house of Ahab will perish. I
will cut off from Ahab every last male in
Israel-slave or free.
9I will make the house of Ahab like the
house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and
like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah.
10As for Jezebel, dogs will devour her on
the plot of ground at Jezreel, and no one
will bury her.' " Then he opened the door
and ran.
11When Jehu went out to his fellow
officers, one of them asked him, "Is
everything all right? Why did this
madman come to you?" "You know the
man and the sort of things he says,"
Jehu replied.
12"That's not true!" they said. "Tell us."
Jehu said, "Here is what he told me:
'This is what the Lord says: I anoint you
king over Israel.' "
13They hurried and took their cloaks and
spread them under him on the bare
steps. Then they blew the trumpet and
shouted, "Jehu is king!"
14So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son
of Nimshi, conspired against Joram.
(Now Joram and all Israel had been
defending Ramoth Gilead against
Hazael king of Aram,
15but King Joram had returned to
Jezreel to recover from the wounds the
Arameans had inflicted on him in the
battle with Hazael king of Aram.) Jehu
said, "If this is the way you feel, don't let
anyone slip out of the city to go and tell
the news in Jezreel."
16Then he got into his chariot and rode
to Jezreel, because Joram was resting
there and Ahaziah king of Judah had
gone down to see him.
17When the lookout standing on the
tower in Jezreel saw Jehu's troops
approaching, he called out, "I see some
troops coming." "Get a horseman,"
Joram ordered. "Send him to meet them
and ask, 'Do you come in peace?' "
18The horseman rode off to meet Jehu
and said, "This is what the king says:
'Do you come in peace?' " "What do you
have to do with peace?" Jehu replied.
"Fall in behind me." The lookout
reported, "The messenger has reached
them, but he isn't coming back."
19So the king sent out a second
horseman. When he came to them he
said, "This is what the king says: 'Do
you come in peace?' " Jehu replied,
"What do you have to do with peace?
Fall in behind me."
20The lookout reported, "He has reached
them, but he isn't coming back either.
The driving is like that of Jehu son of
Nimshi-he drives like a madman."
21"Hitch up my chariot," Joram ordered.
And when it was hitched up, Joram king
of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah rode
out, each in his own chariot, to meet
Jehu. They met him at the plot of ground
that had belonged to Naboth the
Jezreelite.
22When Joram saw Jehu he asked,
"Have you come in peace, Jehu?" "How
can there be peace," Jehu replied, "as
long as all the idolatry and witchcraft of
your mother Jezebel abound?"
23Joram turned about and fled, calling
out to Ahaziah, "Treachery, Ahaziah!"
24Then Jehu drew his bow and shot
Joram between the shoulders. The
arrow pierced his heart and he slumped
down in his chariot.
25Jehu said to Bidkar, his chariot officer,
"Pick him up and throw him on the field
that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite.
Remember how you and I were riding
together in chariots behind Ahab his
father when the Lord made this
prophecy about him:
26'Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth
and the blood of his sons, declares the
Lord , and I will surely make you pay for
it on this plot of ground, declares the
Lord .' Now then, pick him up and throw
him on that plot, in accordance with the
word of the Lord ."
27When Ahaziah king of Judah saw what
had happened, he fled up the road to
Beth Haggan. Jehu chased him,
shouting, "Kill him too!" They wounded
him in his chariot on the way up to Gur
near Ibleam, but he escaped to Megiddo
and died there.
28His servants took him by chariot to
Jerusalem and buried him with his
fathers in his tomb in the City of David.
29(In the eleventh year of Joram son of
Ahab, Ahaziah had become king of
Judah.)
30Then Jehu went to Jezreel. When
Jezebel heard about it, she painted her
eyes, arranged her hair and looked out
of a window.
31As Jehu entered the gate, she asked,
"Have you come in peace, Zimri, you
murderer of your master?"
32He looked up at the window and called
out, "Who is on my side? Who?" Two or
three eunuchs looked down at him.
33"Throw her down!" Jehu said. So they
threw her down, and some of her blood
spattered the wall and the horses as
they trampled her underfoot.
34Jehu went in and ate and drank. "Take
care of that cursed woman," he said,
"and bury her, for she was a king's
daughter."
35But when they went out to bury her,
they found nothing except her skull, her
feet and her hands.
36They went back and told Jehu, who
said, "This is the word of the Lord that
he spoke through his servant Elijah the
Tishbite: On the plot of ground at
Jezreel dogs will devour Jezebel's flesh.
37Jezebel's body will be like refuse on
the ground in the plot at Jezreel, so that
no one will be able to say, 'This is
Jezebel.' "
10Now there were in Samaria
seventy sons of the house of Ahab. So
Jehu wrote letters and sent them to
Samaria: to the officials of Jezreel, to
the elders and to the guardians of
Ahab's children. He said,
2"As soon as this letter reaches you,
since your master's sons are with you
and you have chariots and horses, a
fortified city and weapons,
3choose the best and most worthy of
your master's sons and set him on his
father's throne. Then fight for your
master's house."
4But they were terrified and said, "If two
kings could not resist him, how can we?"
5So the palace administrator, the city
governor, the elders and the guardians
sent this message to Jehu: "We are your
servants and we will do anything you
say. We will not appoint anyone as king;
you do whatever you think best."
6Then Jehu wrote them a second letter,
saying, "If you are on my side and will
obey me, take the heads of your
master's sons and come to me in
Jezreel by this time tomorrow." Now the
royal princes, seventy of them, were
with the leading men of the city, who
were rearing them.
7When the letter arrived, these men took
the princes and slaughtered all seventy
of them. They put their heads in baskets
and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel.
8When the messenger arrived, he told
Jehu, "They have brought the heads of
the princes." Then Jehu ordered, "Put
them in two piles at the entrance of the
city gate until morning."
9The next morning Jehu went out. He
stood before all the people and said,
"You are innocent. It was I who
conspired against my master and killed
him, but who killed all these?
10Know then, that not a word the Lord
has spoken against the house of Ahab
will fail. The Lord has done what he
promised through his servant Elijah."
11So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel
who remained of the house of Ahab, as
well as all his chief men, his close
friends and his priests, leaving him no
survivor.
12Jehu then set out and went toward
Samaria. At Beth Eked of the
Shepherds,
13he met some relatives of Ahaziah king
of Judah and asked, "Who are you?"
They said, "We are relatives of Ahaziah,
and we have come down to greet the
families of the king and of the queen
mother."
14"Take them alive!" he ordered. So they
took them alive and slaughtered them
by the well of Beth Eked-forty-two men.
He left no survivor.
15After he left there, he came upon
Jehonadab son of Recab, who was on
his way to meet him. Jehu greeted him
and said, "Are you in accord with me, as
I am with you?" "I am," Jehonadab
answered. "If so," said Jehu, "give me
your hand." So he did, and Jehu helped
him up into the chariot.
16Jehu said, "Come with me and see my
zeal for the Lord ." Then he had him ride
along in his chariot.
17When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed
all who were left there of Ahab's family;
he destroyed them, according to the
word of the Lord spoken to Elijah.
18Then Jehu brought all the people
together and said to them, "Ahab served
Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much.
19Now summon all the prophets of Baal,
all his ministers and all his priests. See
that no one is missing, because I am
going to hold a great sacrifice for Baal.
Anyone who fails to come will no longer
live." But Jehu was acting deceptively in
order to destroy the ministers of Baal.
20Jehu said, "Call an assembly in honor
of Baal." So they proclaimed it.
21Then he sent word throughout Israel,
and all the ministers of Baal came; not
one stayed away. They crowded into the
temple of Baal until it was full from one
end to the other.
22And Jehu said to the keeper of the
wardrobe, "Bring robes for all the
ministers of Baal." So he brought out
robes for them.
23Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of
Recab went into the temple of Baal.
Jehu said to the ministers of Baal, "Look
around and see that no servants of the
Lord are here with you-only ministers of
Baal."
24So they went in to make sacrifices and
burnt offerings. Now Jehu had posted
eighty men outside with this warning: "If
one of you lets any of the men I am
placing in your hands escape, it will be
your life for his life."
25As soon as Jehu had finished making
the burnt offering, he ordered the guards
and officers: "Go in and kill them; let no
one escape." So they cut them down
with the sword. The guards and officers
threw the bodies out and then entered
the inner shrine of the temple of Baal.
26They brought the sacred stone out of
the temple of Baal and burned it.
27They demolished the sacred stone of
Baal and tore down the temple of Baal,
and people have used it for a latrine to
this day.
28So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in
Israel.
29However, he did not turn away from
the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat,
which he had caused Israel to committhe
worship of the golden calves at
Bethel and Dan.
30The Lord said to Jehu, "Because you
have done well in accomplishing what is
right in my eyes and have done to the
house of Ahab all I had in mind to do,
your descendants will sit on the throne
of Israel to the fourth generation."
31Yet Jehu was not careful to keep the
law of the Lord , the God of Israel, with
all his heart. He did not turn away from
the sins of Jeroboam, which he had
caused Israel to commit.
32In those days the Lord began to
reduce the size of Israel. Hazael
overpowered the Israelites throughout
their territory
33east of the Jordan in all the land of
Gilead (the region of Gad, Reuben and
Manasseh), from Aroer by the Arnon
Gorge through Gilead to Bashan.
34As for the other events of Jehu's reign,
all he did, and all his achievements, are
they not written in the book of the annals
of the kings of Israel?
35Jehu rested with his fathers and was
buried in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his
son succeeded him as king.
36The time that Jehu reigned over Israel
in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
11When Athaliah the mother of
Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she
proceeded to destroy the whole royal
family.
2But Jehosheba, the daughter of King
Jehoram and sister of Ahaziah, took
Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him
away from among the royal princes, who
were about to be murdered. She put him
and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him
from Athaliah; so he was not killed.
3He remained hidden with his nurse at
the temple of the Lord for six years while
Athaliah ruled the land.
4In the seventh year Jehoiada sent for
the commanders of units of a hundred,
the Carites and the guards and had
them brought to him at the temple of the
Lord . He made a covenant with them
and put them under oath at the temple
of the Lord . Then he showed them the
king's son.
5He commanded them, saying, "This is
what you are to do: You who are in the
three companies that are going on duty
on the Sabbath-a third of you guarding
the royal palace,
6a third at the Sur Gate, and a third at
the gate behind the guard, who take
turns guarding the temple-
7and you who are in the other two
companies that normally go off Sabbath
duty are all to guard the temple for the
king.
8Station yourselves around the king,
each man with his weapon in his hand.
Anyone who approaches your ranks
must be put to death. Stay close to the
king wherever he goes."
9The commanders of units of a hundred
did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered.
Each one took his men-those who were
going on duty on the Sabbath and those
who were going off duty-and came to
Jehoiada the priest.
10Then he gave the commanders the
spears and shields that had belonged to
King David and that were in the temple
of the Lord .
11The guards, each with his weapon in
his hand, stationed themselves around
the king-near the altar and the temple,
from the south side to the north side of
the temple.
12Jehoiada brought out the king's son
and put the crown on him; he presented
him with a copy of the covenant and
proclaimed him king. They anointed him,
and the people clapped their hands and
shouted, "Long live the king!"
13When Athaliah heard the noise made
by the guards and the people, she went
to the people at the temple of the Lord .
14She looked and there was the king,
standing by the pillar, as the custom
was. The officers and the trumpeters
were beside the king, and all the people
of the land were rejoicing and blowing
trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her robes
and called out, "Treason! Treason!"
15Jehoiada the priest ordered the
commanders of units of a hundred, who
were in charge of the troops: "Bring her
out between the ranks and put to the
sword anyone who follows her." For the
priest had said, "She must not be put to
death in the temple of the Lord ."
16So they seized her as she reached the
place where the horses enter the palace
grounds, and there she was put to death.
17Jehoiada then made a covenant
between the Lord and the king and
people that they would be the Lord 's
people. He also made a covenant
between the king and the people.
18All the people of the land went to the
temple of Baal and tore it down. They
smashed the altars and idols to pieces
and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in
front of the altars. Then Jehoiada the
priest posted guards at the temple of the
Lord .
19He took with him the commanders of
hundreds, the Carites, the guards and
all the people of the land, and together
they brought the king down from the
temple of the Lord and went into the
palace, entering by way of the gate of
the guards. The king then took his place
on the royal throne,
20and all the people of the land rejoiced.
And the city was quiet, because Athaliah
had been slain with the sword at the
palace.
21Joash was seven years old when he
began to reign.
12In the seventh year of Jehu, Joash
became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem forty years. His mother's
name was Zibiah; she was from
Beersheba.
2Joash did what was right in the eyes of
the Lord all the years Jehoiada the
priest instructed him.
3The high places, however, were not
removed; the people continued to offer
sacrifices and burn incense there.
4Joash said to the priests, "Collect all
the money that is brought as sacred
offerings to the temple of the Lord -the
money collected in the census, the
money received from personal vows and
the money brought voluntarily to the
temple.
5Let every priest receive the money from
one of the treasurers, and let it be used
to repair whatever damage is found in
the temple."
6But by the twenty-third year of King
Joash the priests still had not repaired
the temple.
7Therefore King Joash summoned
Jehoiada the priest and the other priests
and asked them, "Why aren't you
repairing the damage done to the
temple? Take no more money from your
treasurers, but hand it over for repairing
the temple."
8The priests agreed that they would not
collect any more money from the people
and that they would not repair the
temple themselves.
9Jehoiada the priest took a chest and
bored a hole in its lid. He placed it
beside the altar, on the right side as one
enters the temple of the Lord . The
priests who guarded the entrance put
into the chest all the money that was
brought to the temple of the Lord .
10Whenever they saw that there was a
large amount of money in the chest, the
royal secretary and the high priest came,
counted the money that had been
brought into the temple of the Lord and
put it into bags.
11When the amount had been
determined, they gave the money to the
men appointed to supervise the work on
the temple. With it they paid those who
worked on the temple of the Lord -the
carpenters and builders,
12the masons and stonecutters. They
purchased timber and dressed stone for
the repair of the temple of the Lord , and
met all the other expenses of restoring
the temple.
13The money brought into the temple
was not spent for making silver basins,
wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls,
trumpets or any other articles of gold or
silver for the temple of the Lord ;
14it was paid to the workmen, who used
it to repair the temple.
15They did not require an accounting
from those to whom they gave the
money to pay the workers, because they
acted with complete honesty.
16The money from the guilt offerings and
sin offerings was not brought into the
temple of the Lord ; it belonged to the
priests.
17About this time Hazael king of Aram
went up and attacked Gath and
captured it. Then he turned to attack
Jerusalem.
18But Joash king of Judah took all the
sacred objects dedicated by his fathers-
Jehoshaphat, Jehoram and Ahaziah, the
kings of Judah-and the gifts he himself
had dedicated and all the gold found in
the treasuries of the temple of the Lord
and of the royal palace, and he sent
them to Hazael king of Aram, who then
withdrew from Jerusalem.
19As for the other events of the reign of
Joash, and all he did, are they not
written in the book of the annals of the
kings of Judah?
20His officials conspired against him and
assassinated him at Beth Millo, on the
road down to Silla.
21The officials who murdered him were
Jozabad son of Shimeath and
Jehozabad son of Shomer. He died and
was buried with his fathers in the City of
David. And Amaziah his son succeeded
him as king.
13In the twenty-third year of Joash
son of Ahaziah king of Judah, Jehoahaz
son of Jehu became king of Israel in
Samaria, and he reigned seventeen
years.
2He did evil in the eyes of the Lord by
following the sins of Jeroboam son of
Nebat, which he had caused Israel to
commit, and he did not turn away from
them.
3So the Lord 's anger burned against
Israel, and for a long time he kept them
under the power of Hazael king of Aram
and Ben-Hadad his son.
4Then Jehoahaz sought the Lord 's favor,
and the Lord listened to him, for he saw
how severely the king of Aram was
oppressing Israel.
5The Lord provided a deliverer for Israel,
and they escaped from the power of
Aram. So the Israelites lived in their own
homes as they had before.
6But they did not turn away from the sins
of the house of Jeroboam, which he had
caused Israel to commit; they continued
in them. Also, the Asherah pole
remained standing in Samaria.
7Nothing had been left of the army of
Jehoahaz except fifty horsemen, ten
chariots and ten thousand foot soldiers,
for the king of Aram had destroyed the
rest and made them like the dust at
threshing time.
8As for the other events of the reign of
Jehoahaz, all he did and his
achievements, are they not written in the
book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
9Jehoahaz rested with his fathers and
was buried in Samaria. And Jehoash his
son succeeded him as king.
10In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king
of Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz
became king of Israel in Samaria, and
he reigned sixteen years.
11He did evil in the eyes of the Lord and
did not turn away from any of the sins of
Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had
caused Israel to commit; he continued in
them.
12As for the other events of the reign of
Jehoash, all he did and his
achievements, including his war against
Amaziah king of Judah, are they not
written in the book of the annals of the
kings of Israel?
13Jehoash rested with his fathers, and
Jeroboam succeeded him on the throne.
Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the
kings of Israel.
14Now Elisha was suffering from the
illness from which he died. Jehoash king
of Israel went down to see him and wept
over him. "My father! My father!" he
cried. "The chariots and horsemen of
Israel!"
15Elisha said, "Get a bow and some
arrows," and he did so.
16"Take the bow in your hands," he said
to the king of Israel. When he had taken
it, Elisha put his hands on the king's
hands.
17"Open the east window," he said, and
he opened it. "Shoot!" Elisha said, and
he shot. "The Lord 's arrow of victory,
the arrow of victory over Aram!" Elisha
declared. "You will completely destroy
the Arameans at Aphek."
18Then he said, "Take the arrows," and
the king took them. Elisha told him,
"Strike the ground." He struck it three
times and stopped.
19The man of God was angry with him
and said, "You should have struck the
ground five or six times; then you would
have defeated Aram and completely
destroyed it. But now you will defeat it
only three times."
20Elisha died and was buried. Now
Moabite raiders used to enter the
country every spring.
21Once while some Israelites were
burying a man, suddenly they saw a
band of raiders; so they threw the man's
body into Elisha's tomb. When the body
touched Elisha's bones, the man came
to life and stood up on his feet.
22Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel
throughout the reign of Jehoahaz.
23But the Lord was gracious to them and
had compassion and showed concern
for them because of his covenant with
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. To this day
he has been unwilling to destroy them or
banish them from his presence.
24Hazael king of Aram died, and Ben-
Hadad his son succeeded him as king.
25Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz
recaptured from Ben-Hadad son of
Hazael the towns he had taken in battle
from his father Jehoahaz. Three times
Jehoash defeated him, and so he
recovered the Israelite towns.
14In the second year of Jehoash son
of Jehoahaz king of Israel, Amaziah son
of Joash king of Judah began to reign.
2He was twenty-five years old when he
became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His
mother's name was Jehoaddin; she was
from Jerusalem.
3He did what was right in the eyes of the
Lord , but not as his father David had
done. In everything he followed the
example of his father Joash.
4The high places, however, were not
removed; the people continued to offer
sacrifices and burn incense there.
5After the kingdom was firmly in his
grasp, he executed the officials who had
murdered his father the king.
6Yet he did not put the sons of the
assassins to death, in accordance with
what is written in the Book of the Law of
Moses where the Lord commanded:
"Fathers shall not be put to death for
their children, nor children put to death
for their fathers; each is to die for his
own sins."
7He was the one who defeated ten
thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt
and captured Sela in battle, calling it
Joktheel, the name it has to this day.
8Then Amaziah sent messengers to
Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of
Jehu, king of Israel, with the challenge:
"Come, meet me face to face."
9But Jehoash king of Israel replied to
Amaziah king of Judah: "A thistle in
Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in
Lebanon, 'Give your daughter to my son
in marriage.' Then a wild beast in
Lebanon came along and trampled the
thistle underfoot.
10You have indeed defeated Edom and
now you are arrogant. Glory in your
victory, but stay at home! Why ask for
trouble and cause your own downfall
and that of Judah also?"
11Amaziah, however, would not listen,
so Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He
and Amaziah king of Judah faced each
other at Beth Shemesh in Judah.
12Judah was routed by Israel, and every
man fled to his home.
13Jehoash king of Israel captured
Amaziah king of Judah, the son of
Joash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth
Shemesh. Then Jehoash went to
Jerusalem and broke down the wall of
Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the
Corner Gate-a section about six
hundred feet long.
14He took all the gold and silver and all
the articles found in the temple of the
Lord and in the treasuries of the royal
palace. He also took hostages and
returned to Samaria.
15As for the other events of the reign of
Jehoash, what he did and his
achievements, including his war against
Amaziah king of Judah, are they not
written in the book of the annals of the
kings of Israel?
16Jehoash rested with his fathers and
was buried in Samaria with the kings of
Israel. And Jeroboam his son
succeeded him as king.
17Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah
lived for fifteen years after the death of
Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
18As for the other events of Amaziah's
reign, are they not written in the book of
the annals of the kings of Judah?
19They conspired against him in
Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish, but
they sent men after him to Lachish and
killed him there.
20He was brought back by horse and
was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers,
in the City of David.
21Then all the people of Judah took
Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and
made him king in place of his father
Amaziah.
22He was the one who rebuilt Elath and
restored it to Judah after Amaziah
rested with his fathers.
23In the fifteenth year of Amaziah son of
Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam son of
Jehoash king of Israel became king in
Samaria, and he reigned forty-one years.
24He did evil in the eyes of the Lord and
did not turn away from any of the sins of
Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had
caused Israel to commit.
25He was the one who restored the
boundaries of Israel from Lebo Hamath
to the Sea of the Arabah, in accordance
with the word of the Lord , the God of
Israel, spoken through his servant
Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet from
Gath Hepher.
26The Lord had seen how bitterly
everyone in Israel, whether slave or free,
was suffering; there was no one to help
them.
27And since the Lord had not said he
would blot out the name of Israel from
under heaven, he saved them by the
hand of Jeroboam son of Jehoash.
28As for the other events of Jeroboam's
reign, all he did, and his military
achievements, including how he
recovered for Israel both Damascus and
Hamath, which had belonged to Yaudi,
are they not written in the book of the
annals of the kings of Israel?
29Jeroboam rested with his fathers, the
kings of Israel. And Zechariah his son
succeeded him as king.
15In the twenty-seventh year of
Jeroboam king of Israel, Azariah son of
Amaziah king of Judah began to reign.
2He was sixteen years old when he
became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother's
name was Jecoliah; she was from
Jerusalem.
3He did what was right in the eyes of the
Lord , just as his father Amaziah had
done.
4The high places, however, were not
removed; the people continued to offer
sacrifices and burn incense there.
5The Lord afflicted the king with leprosy
until the day he died, and he lived in a
separate house. Jotham the king's son
had charge of the palace and governed
the people of the land.
6As for the other events of Azariah's
reign, and all he did, are they not written
in the book of the annals of the kings of
Judah?
7Azariah rested with his fathers and was
buried near them in the City of David.
And Jotham his son succeeded him as
king.
8In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king
of Judah, Zechariah son of Jeroboam
became king of Israel in Samaria, and
he reigned six months.
9He did evil in the eyes of the Lord , as
his fathers had done. He did not turn
away from the sins of Jeroboam son of
Nebat, which he had caused Israel to
commit.
10Shallum son of Jabesh conspired
against Zechariah. He attacked him in
front of the people, assassinated him
and succeeded him as king.
11The other events of Zechariah's reign
are written in the book of the annals of
the kings of Israel.
12So the word of the Lord spoken to
Jehu was fulfilled: "Your descendants
will sit on the throne of Israel to the
fourth generation."
13Shallum son of Jabesh became king in
the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of
Judah, and he reigned in Samaria one
month.
14Then Menahem son of Gadi went from
Tirzah up to Samaria. He attacked
Shallum son of Jabesh in Samaria,
assassinated him and succeeded him
as king.
15The other events of Shallum's reign,
and the conspiracy he led, are written in
the book of the annals of the kings of
Israel.
16At that time Menahem, starting out
from Tirzah, attacked Tiphsah and
everyone in the city and its vicinity,
because they refused to open their
gates. He sacked Tiphsah and ripped
open all the pregnant women.
17In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king
of Judah, Menahem son of Gadi
became king of Israel, and he reigned in
Samaria ten years.
18He did evil in the eyes of the Lord .
During his entire reign he did not turn
away from the sins of Jeroboam son of
Nebat, which he had caused Israel to
commit.
19Then Pul king of Assyria invaded the
land, and Menahem gave him a
thousand talents of silver to gain his
support and strengthen his own hold on
the kingdom.
20Menahem exacted this money from
Israel. Every wealthy man had to
contribute fifty shekels of silver to be
given to the king of Assyria. So the king
of Assyria withdrew and stayed in the
land no longer.
21As for the other events of Menahem's
reign, and all he did, are they not written
in the book of the annals of the kings of
Israel?
22Menahem rested with his fathers. And
Pekahiah his son succeeded him as
king.
23In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of
Judah, Pekahiah son of Menahem
became king of Israel in Samaria, and
he reigned two years.
24Pekahiah did evil in the eyes of the
Lord . He did not turn away from the
sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which
he had caused Israel to commit.
25One of his chief officers, Pekah son of
Remaliah, conspired against him.
Taking fifty men of Gilead with him, he
assassinated Pekahiah, along with
Argob and Arieh, in the citadel of the
royal palace at Samaria. So Pekah killed
Pekahiah and succeeded him as king.
26The other events of Pekahiah's reign,
and all he did, are written in the book of
the annals of the kings of Israel.
27In the fifty-second year of Azariah king
of Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah
became king of Israel in Samaria, and
he reigned twenty years.
28He did evil in the eyes of the Lord . He
did not turn away from the sins of
Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had
caused Israel to commit.
29In the time of Pekah king of Israel,
Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came and
took Ijon, Abel Beth Maacah, Janoah,
Kedesh and Hazor. He took Gilead and
Galilee, including all the land of Naphtali,
and deported the people to Assyria.
30Then Hoshea son of Elah conspired
against Pekah son of Remaliah. He
attacked and assassinated him, and
then succeeded him as king in the
twentieth year of Jotham son of Uzziah.
31As for the other events of Pekah's
reign, and all he did, are they not written
in the book of the annals of the kings of
Israel?
32In the second year of Pekah son of
Remaliah king of Israel, Jotham son of
Uzziah king of Judah began to reign.
33He was twenty-five years old when he
became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother's
name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok.
34He did what was right in the eyes of
the Lord , just as his father Uzziah had
done.
35The high places, however, were not
removed; the people continued to offer
sacrifices and burn incense there.
Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the
temple of the Lord .
36As for the other events of Jotham's
reign, and what he did, are they not
written in the book of the annals of the
kings of Judah?
37(In those days the Lord began to send
Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of
Remaliah against Judah.)
38Jotham rested with his fathers and
was buried with them in the City of
David, the city of his father. And Ahaz
his son succeeded him as king.
16In the seventeenth year of Pekah
son of Remaliah, Ahaz son of Jotham
king of Judah began to reign.
2Ahaz was twenty years old when he
became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem sixteen years. Unlike David
his father, he did not do what was right
in the eyes of the Lord his God.
3He walked in the ways of the kings of
Israel and even sacrificed his son in the
fire, following the detestable ways of the
nations the Lord had driven out before
the Israelites.
4He offered sacrifices and burned
incense at the high places, on the
hilltops and under every spreading tree.
5Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah
son of Remaliah king of Israel marched
up to fight against Jerusalem and
besieged Ahaz, but they could not
overpower him.
6At that time, Rezin king of Aram
recovered Elath for Aram by driving out
the men of Judah. Edomites then moved
into Elath and have lived there to this
day.
7Ahaz sent messengers to say to
Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, "I am
your servant and vassal. Come up and
save me out of the hand of the king of
Aram and of the king of Israel, who are
attacking me."
8And Ahaz took the silver and gold
found in the temple of the Lord and in
the treasuries of the royal palace and
sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria.
9The king of Assyria complied by
attacking Damascus and capturing it. He
deported its inhabitants to Kir and put
Rezin to death.
10Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to
meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria. He
saw an altar in Damascus and sent to
Uriah the priest a sketch of the altar,
with detailed plans for its construction.
11So Uriah the priest built an altar in
accordance with all the plans that King
Ahaz had sent from Damascus and
finished it before King Ahaz returned.
12When the king came back from
Damascus and saw the altar, he
approached it and presented offerings
on it.
13He offered up his burnt offering and
grain offering, poured out his drink
offering, and sprinkled the blood of his
fellowship offerings on the altar.
14The bronze altar that stood before the
Lord he brought from the front of the
temple-from between the new altar and
the temple of the Lord -and put it on the
north side of the new altar.
15King Ahaz then gave these orders to
Uriah the priest: "On the large new altar,
offer the morning burnt offering and the
evening grain offering, the king's burnt
offering and his grain offering, and the
burnt offering of all the people of the
land, and their grain offering and their
drink offering. Sprinkle on the altar all
the blood of the burnt offerings and
sacrifices. But I will use the bronze altar
for seeking guidance."
16And Uriah the priest did just as King
Ahaz had ordered.
17King Ahaz took away the side panels
and removed the basins from the
movable stands. He removed the Sea
from the bronze bulls that supported it
and set it on a stone base.
18He took away the Sabbath canopy that
had been built at the temple and
removed the royal entryway outside the
temple of the Lord , in deference to the
king of Assyria.
19As for the other events of the reign of
Ahaz, and what he did, are they not
written in the book of the annals of the
kings of Judah?
20Ahaz rested with his fathers and was
buried with them in the City of David.
And Hezekiah his son succeeded him
as king.
17In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of
Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king
of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned
nine years.
2He did evil in the eyes of the Lord , but
not like the kings of Israel who preceded
him.
3Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up
to attack Hoshea, who had been
Shalmaneser's vassal and had paid him
tribute.
4But the king of Assyria discovered that
Hoshea was a traitor, for he had sent
envoys to So king of Egypt, and he no
longer paid tribute to the king of Assyria,
as he had done year by year. Therefore
Shalmaneser seized him and put him in
prison.
5The king of Assyria invaded the entire
land, marched against Samaria and laid
siege to it for three years.
6In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of
Assyria captured Samaria and deported
the Israelites to Assyria. He settled them
in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River
and in the towns of the Medes.
7All this took place because the
Israelites had sinned against the Lord
their God, who had brought them up out
of Egypt from under the power of
Pharaoh king of Egypt. They worshiped
other gods
8and followed the practices of the
nations the Lord had driven out before
them, as well as the practices that the
kings of Israel had introduced.
9The Israelites secretly did things
against the Lord their God that were not
right. From watchtower to fortified city
they built themselves high places in all
their towns.
10They set up sacred stones and
Asherah poles on every high hill and
under every spreading tree.
11At every high place they burned
incense, as the nations whom the Lord
had driven out before them had done.
They did wicked things that provoked
the Lord to anger.
12They worshiped idols, though the Lord
had said, "You shall not do this."
13The Lord warned Israel and Judah
through all his prophets and seers:
"Turn from your evil ways. Observe my
commands and decrees, in accordance
with the entire Law that I commanded
your fathers to obey and that I delivered
to you through my servants the
prophets."
14But they would not listen and were as
stiff-necked as their fathers, who did not
trust in the Lord their God.
15They rejected his decrees and the
covenant he had made with their fathers
and the warnings he had given them.
They followed worthless idols and
themselves became worthless. They
imitated the nations around them
although the Lord had ordered them,
"Do not do as they do," and they did the
things the Lord had forbidden them to
do.
16They forsook all the commands of the
Lord their God and made for themselves
two idols cast in the shape of calves,
and an Asherah pole. They bowed down
to all the starry hosts, and they
worshiped Baal.
17They sacrificed their sons and
daughters in the fire. They practiced
divination and sorcery and sold
themselves to do evil in the eyes of the
Lord , provoking him to anger.
18So the Lord was very angry with Israel
and removed them from his presence.
Only the tribe of Judah was left,
19and even Judah did not keep the
commands of the Lord their God. They
followed the practices Israel had
introduced.
20Therefore the Lord rejected all the
people of Israel; he afflicted them and
gave them into the hands of plunderers,
until he thrust them from his presence.
21When he tore Israel away from the
house of David, they made Jeroboam
son of Nebat their king. Jeroboam
enticed Israel away from following the
Lord and caused them to commit a great
sin.
22The Israelites persisted in all the sins
of Jeroboam and did not turn away from
them
23until the Lord removed them from his
presence, as he had warned through all
his servants the prophets. So the people
of Israel were taken from their homeland
into exile in Assyria, and they are still
there.
24The king of Assyria brought people
from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath
and Sepharvaim and settled them in the
towns of Samaria to replace the
Israelites. They took over Samaria and
lived in its towns.
25When they first lived there, they did
not worship the Lord ; so he sent lions
among them and they killed some of the
people.
26It was reported to the king of Assyria:
"The people you deported and resettled
in the towns of Samaria do not know
what the god of that country requires.
He has sent lions among them, which
are killing them off, because the people
do not know what he requires."
27Then the king of Assyria gave this
order: "Have one of the priests you took
captive from Samaria go back to live
there and teach the people what the god
of the land requires."
28So one of the priests who had been
exiled from Samaria came to live in
Bethel and taught them how to worship
the Lord .
29Nevertheless, each national group
made its own gods in the several towns
where they settled, and set them up in
the shrines the people of Samaria had
made at the high places.
30The men from Babylon made Succoth
Benoth, the men from Cuthah made
Nergal, and the men from Hamath made
Ashima;
31the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak,
and the Sepharvites burned their
children in the fire as sacrifices to
Adrammelech and Anammelech, the
gods of Sepharvaim.
32They worshiped the Lord , but they
also appointed all sorts of their own
people to officiate for them as priests in
the shrines at the high places.
33They worshiped the Lord , but they
also served their own gods in
accordance with the customs of the
nations from which they had been
brought.
34To this day they persist in their former
practices. They neither worship the Lord
nor adhere to the decrees and
ordinances, the laws and commands
that the Lord gave the descendants of
Jacob, whom he named Israel.
35When the Lord made a covenant with
the Israelites, he commanded them: "Do
not worship any other gods or bow down
to them, serve them or sacrifice to them.
36But the Lord , who brought you up out
of Egypt with mighty power and
outstretched arm, is the one you must
worship. To him you shall bow down
and to him offer sacrifices.
37You must always be careful to keep
the decrees and ordinances, the laws
and commands he wrote for you. Do not
worship other gods.
38Do not forget the covenant I have
made with you, and do not worship
other gods.
39Rather, worship the Lord your God; it
is he who will deliver you from the hand
of all your enemies."
40They would not listen, however, but
persisted in their former practices.
41Even while these people were
worshiping the Lord , they were serving
their idols. To this day their children and
grandchildren continue to do as their
fathers did.
18In the third year of Hoshea son of
Elah king of Israel, Hezekiah son of
Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
2He was twenty-five years old when he
became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His
mother's name was Abijah daughter of
Zechariah.
3He did what was right in the eyes of the
Lord , just as his father David had done.
4He removed the high places, smashed
the sacred stones and cut down the
Asherah poles. He broke into pieces the
bronze snake Moses had made, for up
to that time the Israelites had been
burning incense to it. (It was called
Nehushtan. )
5Hezekiah trusted in the Lord , the God
of Israel. There was no one like him
among all the kings of Judah, either
before him or after him.
6He held fast to the Lord and did not
cease to follow him; he kept the
commands the Lord had given Moses.
7And the Lord was with him; he was
successful in whatever he undertook.
He rebelled against the king of Assyria
and did not serve him.
8From watchtower to fortified city, he
defeated the Philistines, as far as Gaza
and its territory.
9In King Hezekiah's fourth year, which
was the seventh year of Hoshea son of
Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of
Assyria marched against Samaria and
laid siege to it.
10At the end of three years the Assyrians
took it. So Samaria was captured in
Hezekiah's sixth year, which was the
ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel.
11The king of Assyria deported Israel to
Assyria and settled them in Halah, in
Gozan on the Habor River and in towns
of the Medes.
12This happened because they had not
obeyed the Lord their God, but had
violated his covenant-all that Moses the
servant of the Lord commanded. They
neither listened to the commands nor
carried them out.
13In the fourteenth year of King
Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib king of
Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of
Judah and captured them.
14So Hezekiah king of Judah sent this
message to the king of Assyria at
Lachish: "I have done wrong. Withdraw
from me, and I will pay whatever you
demand of me." The king of Assyria
exacted from Hezekiah king of Judah
three hundred talents of silver and thirty
talents of gold.
15So Hezekiah gave him all the silver
that was found in the temple of the Lord
and in the treasuries of the royal palace.
16At this time Hezekiah king of Judah
stripped off the gold with which he had
covered the doors and doorposts of the
temple of the Lord , and gave it to the
king of Assyria.
17The king of Assyria sent his supreme
commander, his chief officer and his
field commander with a large army, from
Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem.
They came up to Jerusalem and
stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper
Pool, on the road to the Washerman's
Field.
18They called for the king; and Eliakim
son of Hilkiah the palace administrator,
Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of
Asaph the recorder went out to them.
19The field commander said to them,
"Tell Hezekiah: " 'This is what the great
king, the king of Assyria, says: On what
are you basing this confidence of yours?
20You say you have strategy and military
strength-but you speak only empty
words. On whom are you depending,
that you rebel against me?
21Look now, you are depending on
Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff,
which pierces a man's hand and wounds
him if he leans on it! Such is Pharaoh
king of Egypt to all who depend on him.
22And if you say to me, "We are
depending on the Lord our God"-isn't he
the one whose high places and altars
Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and
Jerusalem, "You must worship before
this altar in Jerusalem"?
23" 'Come now, make a bargain with my
master, the king of Assyria: I will give
you two thousand horses-if you can put
riders on them!
24How can you repulse one officer of the
least of my master's officials, even
though you are depending on Egypt for
chariots and horsemen ?
25Furthermore, have I come to attack
and destroy this place without word from
the Lord ? The Lord himself told me to
march against this country and destroy
it.' "
26Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, and
Shebna and Joah said to the field
commander, "Please speak to your
servants in Aramaic, since we
understand it. Don't speak to us in
Hebrew in the hearing of the people on
the wall."
27But the commander replied, "Was it
only to your master and you that my
master sent me to say these things, and
not to the men sitting on the wall-who,
like you, will have to eat their own filth
and drink their own urine?"
28Then the commander stood and called
out in Hebrew: "Hear the word of the
great king, the king of Assyria!
29This is what the king says: Do not let
Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot
deliver you from my hand.
30Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to
trust in the Lord when he says, 'The
Lord will surely deliver us; this city will
not be given into the hand of the king of
Assyria.'
31"Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is
what the king of Assyria says: Make
peace with me and come out to me.
Then every one of you will eat from his
own vine and fig tree and drink water
from his own cistern,
32until I come and take you to a land like
your own, a land of grain and new wine,
a land of bread and vineyards, a land of
olive trees and honey. Choose life and
not death! "Do not listen to Hezekiah, for
he is misleading you when he says, 'The
Lord will deliver us.'
33Has the god of any nation ever
delivered his land from the hand of the
king of Assyria?
34Where are the gods of Hamath and
Arpad? Where are the gods of
Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have
they rescued Samaria from my hand?
35Who of all the gods of these countries
has been able to save his land from
me? How then can the Lord deliver
Jerusalem from my hand?"
36But the people remained silent and
said nothing in reply, because the king
had commanded, "Do not answer him."
37Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace
administrator, Shebna the secretary and
Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to
Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and
told him what the field commander had
said.
19When King Hezekiah heard this,
he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth
and went into the temple of the Lord .
2He sent Eliakim the palace
administrator, Shebna the secretary and
the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth,
to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
3They told him, "This is what Hezekiah
says: This day is a day of distress and
rebuke and disgrace, as when children
come to the point of birth and there is no
strength to deliver them.
4It may be that the Lord your God will
hear all the words of the field
commander, whom his master, the king
of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living
God, and that he will rebuke him for the
words the Lord your God has heard.
Therefore pray for the remnant that still
survives."
5When King Hezekiah's officials came to
Isaiah,
6Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master,
'This is what the Lord says: Do not be
afraid of what you have heard-those
words with which the underlings of the
king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
7Listen! I am going to put such a spirit in
him that when he hears a certain report,
he will return to his own country, and
there I will have him cut down with the
sword.' "
8When the field commander heard that
the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he
withdrew and found the king fighting
against Libnah.
9Now Sennacherib received a report that
Tirhakah, the Cushite king of Egypt ,
was marching out to fight against him.
So he again sent messengers to
Hezekiah with this word:
10"Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do
not let the god you depend on deceive
you when he says, 'Jerusalem will not
be handed over to the king of Assyria.'
11Surely you have heard what the kings
of Assyria have done to all the countries,
destroying them completely. And will
you be delivered?
12Did the gods of the nations that were
destroyed by my forefathers deliver
them: the gods of Gozan, Haran,
Rezeph and the people of Eden who
were in Tel Assar?
13Where is the king of Hamath, the king
of Arpad, the king of the city of
Sepharvaim, or of Hena or Ivvah?"
14Hezekiah received the letter from the
messengers and read it. Then he went
up to the temple of the Lord and spread
it out before the Lord .
15And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord : "O
Lord , God of Israel, enthroned between
the cherubim, you alone are God over
all the kingdoms of the earth. You have
made heaven and earth.
16Give ear, O Lord , and hear; open your
eyes, O Lord , and see; listen to the
words Sennacherib has sent to insult
the living God.
17"It is true, O Lord , that the Assyrian
kings have laid waste these nations and
their lands.
18They have thrown their gods into the
fire and destroyed them, for they were
not gods but only wood and stone,
fashioned by men's hands.
19Now, O Lord our God, deliver us from
his hand, so that all kingdoms on earth
may know that you alone, O Lord , are
God."
20Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a
message to Hezekiah: "This is what the
Lord , the God of Israel, says: I have
heard your prayer concerning
Sennacherib king of Assyria.
21This is the word that the Lord has
spoken against him: " 'The Virgin
Daughter of Zion despises you and
mocks you. The Daughter of Jerusalem
tosses her head as you flee.
22Who is it you have insulted and
blasphemed? Against whom have you
raised your voice and lifted your eyes in
pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
23By your messengers you have heaped
insults on the Lord. And you have said,
"With my many chariots I have
ascended the heights of the mountains,
the utmost heights of Lebanon. I have
cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest
of its pines. I have reached its remotest
parts, the finest of its forests.
24I have dug wells in foreign lands and
drunk the water there. With the soles of
my feet I have dried up all the streams
of Egypt."
25" 'Have you not heard? Long ago I
ordained it. In days of old I planned it;
now I have brought it to pass, that you
have turned fortified cities into piles of
stone.
26Their people, drained of power, are
dismayed and put to shame. They are
like plants in the field, like tender green
shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof,
scorched before it grows up.
27" 'But I know where you stay and when
you come and go and how you rage
against me.
28Because you rage against me and
your insolence has reached my ears, I
will put my hook in your nose and my bit
in your mouth, and I will make you
return by the way you came.'
29"This will be the sign for you, O
Hezekiah: "This year you will eat what
grows by itself, and the second year
what springs from that. But in the third
year sow and reap, plant vineyards and
eat their fruit.
30Once more a remnant of the house of
Judah will take root below and bear fruit
above.
31For out of Jerusalem will come a
remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band
of survivors. The zeal of the Lord
Almighty will accomplish this.
32"Therefore this is what the Lord says
concerning the king of Assyria: "He will
not enter this city or shoot an arrow here.
He will not come before it with shield or
build a siege ramp against it.
33By the way that he came he will return;
he will not enter this city, declares the
Lord .
34I will defend this city and save it, for
my sake and for the sake of David my
servant."
35That night the angel of the Lord went
out and put to death a hundred and
eighty-five thousand men in the
Assyrian camp. When the people got up
the next morning-there were all the dead
bodies!
36So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke
camp and withdrew. He returned to
Nineveh and stayed there.
37One day, while he was worshiping in
the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons
Adrammelech and Sharezer cut him
down with the sword, and they escaped
to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon
his son succeeded him as king.
20In those days Hezekiah became ill
and was at the point of death. The
prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him
and said, "This is what the Lord says:
Put your house in order, because you
are going to die; you will not recover."
2Hezekiah turned his face to the wall
and prayed to the Lord ,
3"Remember, O Lord , how I have
walked before you faithfully and with
wholehearted devotion and have done
what is good in your eyes." And
Hezekiah wept bitterly.
4Before Isaiah had left the middle court,
the word of the Lord came to him:
5"Go back and tell Hezekiah, the leader
of my people, 'This is what the Lord , the
God of your father David, says: I have
heard your prayer and seen your tears; I
will heal you. On the third day from now
you will go up to the temple of the Lord .
6I will add fifteen years to your life. And I
will deliver you and this city from the
hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend
this city for my sake and for the sake of
my servant David.' "
7Then Isaiah said, "Prepare a poultice of
figs." They did so and applied it to the
boil, and he recovered.
8Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, "What will
be the sign that the Lord will heal me
and that I will go up to the temple of the
Lord on the third day from now?"
9Isaiah answered, "This is the Lord 's
sign to you that the Lord will do what he
has promised: Shall the shadow go
forward ten steps, or shall it go back ten
steps?"
10"It is a simple matter for the shadow to
go forward ten steps," said Hezekiah.
"Rather, have it go back ten steps."
11Then the prophet Isaiah called upon
the Lord , and the Lord made the
shadow go back the ten steps it had
gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.
12At that time Merodach-Baladan son of
Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah
letters and a gift, because he had heard
of Hezekiah's illness.
13Hezekiah received the messengers
and showed them all that was in his
storehouses-the silver, the gold, the
spices and the fine oil-his armory and
everything found among his treasures.
There was nothing in his palace or in all
his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show
them.
14Then Isaiah the prophet went to King
Hezekiah and asked, "What did those
men say, and where did they come
from?" "From a distant land," Hezekiah
replied. "They came from Babylon."
15The prophet asked, "What did they see
in your palace?" "They saw everything in
my palace," Hezekiah said. "There is
nothing among my treasures that I did
not show them."
16Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear
the word of the Lord :
17The time will surely come when
everything in your palace, and all that
your fathers have stored up until this
day, will be carried off to Babylon.
Nothing will be left, says the Lord .
18And some of your descendants, your
own flesh and blood, that will be born to
you, will be taken away, and they will
become eunuchs in the palace of the
king of Babylon."
19"The word of the Lord you have
spoken is good," Hezekiah replied. For
he thought, "Will there not be peace and
security in my lifetime?"
20As for the other events of Hezekiah's
reign, all his achievements and how he
made the pool and the tunnel by which
he brought water into the city, are they
not written in the book of the annals of
the kings of Judah?
21Hezekiah rested with his fathers. And
Manasseh his son succeeded him as
king.
21Manasseh was twelve years old
when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem fifty-five years. His
mother's name was Hephzibah.
2He did evil in the eyes of the Lord ,
following the detestable practices of the
nations the Lord had driven out before
the Israelites.
3He rebuilt the high places his father
Hezekiah had destroyed; he also
erected altars to Baal and made an
Asherah pole, as Ahab king of Israel
had done. He bowed down to all the
starry hosts and worshiped them.
4He built altars in the temple of the Lord ,
of which the Lord had said, "In
Jerusalem I will put my Name."
5In both courts of the temple of the Lord ,
he built altars to all the starry hosts.
6He sacrificed his own son in the fire,
practiced sorcery and divination, and
consulted mediums and spiritists. He did
much evil in the eyes of the Lord ,
provoking him to anger.
7He took the carved Asherah pole he
had made and put it in the temple, of
which the Lord had said to David and to
his son Solomon, "In this temple and in
Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of
all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name
forever.
8I will not again make the feet of the
Israelites wander from the land I gave
their forefathers, if only they will be
careful to do everything I commanded
them and will keep the whole Law that
my servant Moses gave them."
9But the people did not listen. Manasseh
led them astray, so that they did more
evil than the nations the Lord had
destroyed before the Israelites.
10The Lord said through his servants the
prophets:
11"Manasseh king of Judah has
committed these detestable sins. He
has done more evil than the Amorites
who preceded him and has led Judah
into sin with his idols.
12Therefore this is what the Lord , the
God of Israel, says: I am going to bring
such disaster on Jerusalem and Judah
that the ears of everyone who hears of it
will tingle.
13I will stretch out over Jerusalem the
measuring line used against Samaria
and the plumb line used against the
house of Ahab. I will wipe out Jerusalem
as one wipes a dish, wiping it and
turning it upside down.
14I will forsake the remnant of my
inheritance and hand them over to their
enemies. They will be looted and
plundered by all their foes,
15because they have done evil in my
eyes and have provoked me to anger
from the day their forefathers came out
of Egypt until this day."
16Moreover, Manasseh also shed so
much innocent blood that he filled
Jerusalem from end to end-besides the
sin that he had caused Judah to commit,
so that they did evil in the eyes of the
Lord .
17As for the other events of Manasseh's
reign, and all he did, including the sin he
committed, are they not written in the
book of the annals of the kings of
Judah?
18Manasseh rested with his fathers and
was buried in his palace garden, the
garden of Uzza. And Amon his son
succeeded him as king.
19Amon was twenty-two years old when
he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem two years. His mother's
name was Meshullemeth daughter of
Haruz; she was from Jotbah.
20He did evil in the eyes of the Lord , as
his father Manasseh had done.
21He walked in all the ways of his father;
he worshiped the idols his father had
worshiped, and bowed down to them.
22He forsook the Lord , the God of his
fathers, and did not walk in the way of
the Lord .
23Amon's officials conspired against him
and assassinated the king in his palace.
24Then the people of the land killed all
who had plotted against King Amon, and
they made Josiah his son king in his
place.
25As for the other events of Amon's reign,
and what he did, are they not written in
the book of the annals of the kings of
Judah?
26He was buried in his grave in the
garden of Uzza. And Josiah his son
succeeded him as king.
22Josiah was eight years old when
he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem thirty-one years. His mother's
name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah;
she was from Bozkath.
2He did what was right in the eyes of the
Lord and walked in all the ways of his
father David, not turning aside to the
right or to the left.
3In the eighteenth year of his reign, King
Josiah sent the secretary, Shaphan son
of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the
temple of the Lord . He said:
4"Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and
have him get ready the money that has
been brought into the temple of the
Lord , which the doorkeepers have
collected from the people.
5Have them entrust it to the men
appointed to supervise the work on the
temple. And have these men pay the
workers who repair the temple of the
Lord -
6the carpenters, the builders and the
masons. Also have them purchase
timber and dressed stone to repair the
temple.
7But they need not account for the
money entrusted to them, because they
are acting faithfully."
8Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan
the secretary, "I have found the Book of
the Law in the temple of the Lord ." He
gave it to Shaphan, who read it.
9Then Shaphan the secretary went to
the king and reported to him: "Your
officials have paid out the money that
was in the temple of the Lord and have
entrusted it to the workers and
supervisors at the temple."
10Then Shaphan the secretary informed
the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given
me a book." And Shaphan read from it
in the presence of the king.
11When the king heard the words of the
Book of the Law, he tore his robes.
12He gave these orders to Hilkiah the
priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Acbor
son of Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary
and Asaiah the king's attendant:
13"Go and inquire of the Lord for me and
for the people and for all Judah about
what is written in this book that has
been found. Great is the Lord 's anger
that burns against us because our
fathers have not obeyed the words of
this book; they have not acted in
accordance with all that is written there
concerning us."
14Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Acbor,
Shaphan and Asaiah went to speak to
the prophetess Huldah, who was the
wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of
Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. She
lived in Jerusalem, in the Second
District.
15She said to them, "This is what the
Lord , the God of Israel, says: Tell the
man who sent you to me,
16'This is what the Lord says: I am going
to bring disaster on this place and its
people, according to everything written
in the book the king of Judah has read.
17Because they have forsaken me and
burned incense to other gods and
provoked me to anger by all the idols
their hands have made, my anger will
burn against this place and will not be
quenched.'
18Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to
inquire of the Lord , 'This is what the
Lord , the God of Israel, says
concerning the words you heard:
19Because your heart was responsive
and you humbled yourself before the
Lord when you heard what I have
spoken against this place and its people,
that they would become accursed and
laid waste, and because you tore your
robes and wept in my presence, I have
heard you, declares the Lord .
20Therefore I will gather you to your
fathers, and you will be buried in peace.
Your eyes will not see all the disaster I
am going to bring on this place.' " So
they took her answer back to the king.
23Then the king called together all
the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2He went up to the temple of the Lord
with the men of Judah, the people of
Jerusalem, the priests and the prophetsall
the people from the least to the
greatest. He read in their hearing all the
words of the Book of the Covenant,
which had been found in the temple of
the Lord .
3The king stood by the pillar and
renewed the covenant in the presence
of the Lord -to follow the Lord and keep
his commands, regulations and decrees
with all his heart and all his soul, thus
confirming the words of the covenant
written in this book. Then all the people
pledged themselves to the covenant.
4The king ordered Hilkiah the high priest,
the priests next in rank and the
doorkeepers to remove from the temple
of the Lord all the articles made for Baal
and Asherah and all the starry hosts. He
burned them outside Jerusalem in the
fields of the Kidron Valley and took the
ashes to Bethel.
5He did away with the pagan priests
appointed by the kings of Judah to burn
incense on the high places of the towns
of Judah and on those around
Jerusalem-those who burned incense to
Baal, to the sun and moon, to the
constellations and to all the starry hosts.
6He took the Asherah pole from the
temple of the Lord to the Kidron Valley
outside Jerusalem and burned it there.
He ground it to powder and scattered
the dust over the graves of the common
people.
7He also tore down the quarters of the
male shrine prostitutes, which were in
the temple of the Lord and where
women did weaving for Asherah.
8Josiah brought all the priests from the
towns of Judah and desecrated the high
places, from Geba to Beersheba, where
the priests had burned incense. He
broke down the shrines at the gates-at
the entrance to the Gate of Joshua, the
city governor, which is on the left of the
city gate.
9Although the priests of the high places
did not serve at the altar of the Lord in
Jerusalem, they ate unleavened bread
with their fellow priests.
10He desecrated Topheth, which was in
the Valley of Ben Hinnom, so no one
could use it to sacrifice his son or
daughter in the fire to Molech.
11He removed from the entrance to the
temple of the Lord the horses that the
kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun.
They were in the court near the room of
an official named Nathan-Melech.
Josiah then burned the chariots
dedicated to the sun.
12He pulled down the altars the kings of
Judah had erected on the roof near the
upper room of Ahaz, and the altars
Manasseh had built in the two courts of
the temple of the Lord . He removed
them from there, smashed them to
pieces and threw the rubble into the
Kidron Valley.
13The king also desecrated the high
places that were east of Jerusalem on
the south of the Hill of Corruption-the
ones Solomon king of Israel had built for
Ashtoreth the vile goddess of the
Sidonians, for Chemosh the vile god of
Moab, and for Molech the detestable
god of the people of Ammon.
14Josiah smashed the sacred stones
and cut down the Asherah poles and
covered the sites with human bones.
15Even the altar at Bethel, the high place
made by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who
had caused Israel to sin-even that altar
and high place he demolished. He
burned the high place and ground it to
powder, and burned the Asherah pole
also.
16Then Josiah looked around, and when
he saw the tombs that were there on the
hillside, he had the bones removed from
them and burned on the altar to defile it,
in accordance with the word of the Lord
proclaimed by the man of God who
foretold these things.
17The king asked, "What is that
tombstone I see?" The men of the city
said, "It marks the tomb of the man of
God who came from Judah and
pronounced against the altar of Bethel
the very things you have done to it."
18"Leave it alone," he said. "Don't let
anyone disturb his bones." So they
spared his bones and those of the
prophet who had come from Samaria.
19Just as he had done at Bethel, Josiah
removed and defiled all the shrines at
the high places that the kings of Israel
had built in the towns of Samaria that
had provoked the Lord to anger.
20Josiah slaughtered all the priests of
those high places on the altars and
burned human bones on them. Then he
went back to Jerusalem.
21The king gave this order to all the
people: "Celebrate the Passover to the
Lord your God, as it is written in this
Book of the Covenant."
22Not since the days of the judges who
led Israel, nor throughout the days of the
kings of Israel and the kings of Judah,
had any such Passover been observed.
23But in the eighteenth year of King
Josiah, this Passover was celebrated to
the Lord in Jerusalem.
24Furthermore, Josiah got rid of the
mediums and spiritists, the household
gods, the idols and all the other
detestable things seen in Judah and
Jerusalem. This he did to fulfill the
requirements of the law written in the
book that Hilkiah the priest had
discovered in the temple of the Lord .
25Neither before nor after Josiah was
there a king like him who turned to the
Lord as he did-with all his heart and with
all his soul and with all his strength, in
accordance with all the Law of Moses.
26Nevertheless, the Lord did not turn
away from the heat of his fierce anger,
which burned against Judah because of
all that Manasseh had done to provoke
him to anger.
27So the Lord said, "I will remove Judah
also from my presence as I removed
Israel, and I will reject Jerusalem, the
city I chose, and this temple, about
which I said, 'There shall my Name be.' "
28As for the other events of Josiah's
reign, and all he did, are they not written
in the book of the annals of the kings of
Judah?
29While Josiah was king, Pharaoh Neco
king of Egypt went up to the Euphrates
River to help the king of Assyria. King
Josiah marched out to meet him in
battle, but Neco faced him and killed
him at Megiddo.
30Josiah's servants brought his body in a
chariot from Megiddo to Jerusalem and
buried him in his own tomb. And the
people of the land took Jehoahaz son of
Josiah and anointed him and made him
king in place of his father.
31Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old
when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem three months. His mother's
name was Hamutal daughter of
Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
32He did evil in the eyes of the Lord , just
as his fathers had done.
33Pharaoh Neco put him in chains at
Riblah in the land of Hamath so that he
might not reign in Jerusalem, and he
imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred
talents of silver and a talent of gold.
34Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim son of
Josiah king in place of his father Josiah
and changed Eliakim's name to
Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz and
carried him off to Egypt, and there he
died.
35Jehoiakim paid Pharaoh Neco the
silver and gold he demanded. In order to
do so, he taxed the land and exacted
the silver and gold from the people of
the land according to their assessments.
36Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old
when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother's
name was Zebidah daughter of
Pedaiah; she was from Rumah.
37And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord ,
just as his fathers had done.
24During Jehoiakim's reign,
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
invaded the land, and Jehoiakim
became his vassal for three years. But
then he changed his mind and rebelled
against Nebuchadnezzar.
2The Lord sent Babylonian, Aramean,
Moabite and Ammonite raiders against
him. He sent them to destroy Judah, in
accordance with the word of the Lord
proclaimed by his servants the prophets.
3Surely these things happened to Judah
according to the Lord 's command, in
order to remove them from his presence
because of the sins of Manasseh and all
he had done,
4including the shedding of innocent
blood. For he had filled Jerusalem with
innocent blood, and the Lord was not
willing to forgive.
5As for the other events of Jehoiakim's
reign, and all he did, are they not written
in the book of the annals of the kings of
Judah?
6Jehoiakim rested with his fathers. And
Jehoiachin his son succeeded him as
king.
7The king of Egypt did not march out
from his own country again, because the
king of Babylon had taken all his
territory, from the Wadi of Egypt to the
Euphrates River.
8Jehoiachin was eighteen years old
when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem three months. His mother's
name was Nehushta daughter of
Elnathan; she was from Jerusalem.
9He did evil in the eyes of the Lord , just
as his father had done.
10At that time the officers of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
advanced on Jerusalem and laid siege
to it,
11and Nebuchadnezzar himself came up
to the city while his officers were
besieging it.
12Jehoiachin king of Judah, his mother,
his attendants, his nobles and his
officials all surrendered to him. In the
eighth year of the reign of the king of
Babylon, he took Jehoiachin prisoner.
13As the Lord had declared,
Nebuchadnezzar removed all the
treasures from the temple of the Lord
and from the royal palace, and took
away all the gold articles that Solomon
king of Israel had made for the temple of
the Lord .
14He carried into exile all Jerusalem: all
the officers and fighting men, and all the
craftsmen and artisans-a total of ten
thousand. Only the poorest people of
the land were left.
15Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin
captive to Babylon. He also took from
Jerusalem to Babylon the king's mother,
his wives, his officials and the leading
men of the land.
16The king of Babylon also deported to
Babylon the entire force of seven
thousand fighting men, strong and fit for
war, and a thousand craftsmen and
artisans.
17He made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's
uncle, king in his place and changed his
name to Zedekiah.
18Zedekiah was twenty-one years old
when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother's
name was Hamutal daughter of
Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
19He did evil in the eyes of the Lord , just
as Jehoiakim had done.
20It was because of the Lord 's anger
that all this happened to Jerusalem and
Judah, and in the end he thrust them
from his presence. Now Zedekiah
rebelled against the king of Babylon.
25So in the ninth year of Zedekiah's
reign, on the tenth day of the tenth
month, Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon marched against Jerusalem
with his whole army. He encamped
outside the city and built siege works all
around it.
2The city was kept under siege until the
eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
3By the ninth day of the fourth month the
famine in the city had become so severe
that there was no food for the people to
eat.
4Then the city wall was broken through,
and the whole army fled at night through
the gate between the two walls near the
king's garden, though the Babylonians
were surrounding the city. They fled
toward the Arabah,
5but the Babylonian army pursued the
king and overtook him in the plains of
Jericho. All his soldiers were separated
from him and scattered,
6and he was captured. He was taken to
the king of Babylon at Riblah, where
sentence was pronounced on him.
7They killed the sons of Zedekiah before
his eyes. Then they put out his eyes,
bound him with bronze shackles and
took him to Babylon.
8On the seventh day of the fifth month,
in the nineteenth year of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
Nebuzaradan commander of the
imperial guard, an official of the king of
Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
9He set fire to the temple of the Lord ,
the royal palace and all the houses of
Jerusalem. Every important building he
burned down.
10The whole Babylonian army, under the
commander of the imperial guard, broke
down the walls around Jerusalem.
11Nebuzaradan the commander of the
guard carried into exile the people who
remained in the city, along with the rest
of the populace and those who had
gone over to the king of Babylon.
12But the commander left behind some
of the poorest people of the land to work
the vineyards and fields.
13The Babylonians broke up the bronze
pillars, the movable stands and the
bronze Sea that were at the temple of
the Lord and they carried the bronze to
Babylon.
14They also took away the pots, shovels,
wick trimmers, dishes and all the bronze
articles used in the temple service.
15The commander of the imperial guard
took away the censers and sprinkling
bowls-all that were made of pure gold or
silver.
16The bronze from the two pillars, the
Sea and the movable stands, which
Solomon had made for the temple of the
Lord , was more than could be weighed.
17Each pillar was twenty-seven feet high.
The bronze capital on top of one pillar
was four and a half feet high and was
decorated with a network and
pomegranates of bronze all around. The
other pillar, with its network, was similar.
18The commander of the guard took as
prisoners Seraiah the chief priest,
Zephaniah the priest next in rank and
the three doorkeepers.
19Of those still in the city, he took the
officer in charge of the fighting men and
five royal advisers. He also took the
secretary who was chief officer in
charge of conscripting the people of the
land and sixty of his men who were
found in the city.
20Nebuzaradan the commander took
them all and brought them to the king of
Babylon at Riblah.
21There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath,
the king had them executed. So Judah
went into captivity, away from her land.
22Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the
son of Shaphan, to be over the people
he had left behind in Judah.
23When all the army officers and their
men heard that the king of Babylon had
appointed Gedaliah as governor, they
came to Gedaliah at Mizpah-Ishmael
son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of
Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the
Netophathite, Jaazaniah the son of the
Maacathite, and their men.
24Gedaliah took an oath to reassure
them and their men. "Do not be afraid of
the Babylonian officials," he said. "Settle
down in the land and serve the king of
Babylon, and it will go well with you."
25In the seventh month, however,
Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of
Elishama, who was of royal blood, came
with ten men and assassinated
Gedaliah and also the men of Judah
and the Babylonians who were with him
at Mizpah.
26At this, all the people from the least to
the greatest, together with the army
officers, fled to Egypt for fear of the
Babylonians.
27In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of
Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the year
Evil-Merodach became king of Babylon,
he released Jehoiachin from prison on
the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth
month.
28He spoke kindly to him and gave him a
seat of honor higher than those of the
other kings who were with him in
Babylon.
29So Jehoiachin put aside his prison
clothes and for the rest of his life ate
regularly at the king's table.
30Day by day the king gave Jehoiachin a
regular allowance as long as he lived.

Hazar Shual,
29Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad,
30Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag,

32Their surrounding villages were Etam,

leaders of their clans. Their families
increased greatly,
39and they went to the outskirts of Gedor
to the east of the valley in search of
pasture for their flocks.
40They found rich, good pasture, and the
land was spacious, peaceful and quiet.
Some Hamites had lived there formerly.
41The men whose names were listed
came in the days of Hezekiah king of
Judah. They attacked the Hamites in
their dwellings and also the Meunites
who were there and completely
destroyed them, as is evident to this day.
Then they settled in their place, because
there was pasture for their flocks.
42And five hundred of these Simeonites,
led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah and
Uzziel, the sons of Ishi, invaded the hill
country of Seir.
43They killed the remaining Amalekites
who had escaped, and they have lived
there to this day.
5The sons of Reuben the firstborn of
Israel (he was the firstborn, but when he
defiled his father's marriage bed, his
rights as firstborn were given to the sons
of Joseph son of Israel; so he could not
be listed in the genealogical record in
accordance with his birthright,
2and though Judah was the strongest of
his brothers and a ruler came from him,
the rights of the firstborn belonged to
Joseph)-
3the sons of Reuben the firstborn of
Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron and Carmi.
4The descendants of Joel: Shemaiah his
son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,
5Micah his son, Reaiah his son, Baal his
son,
6and Beerah his son, whom Tiglath-
Pileser king of Assyria took into exile.
Beerah was a leader of the Reubenites.
7Their relatives by clans, listed
according to their genealogical records:
Jeiel the chief, Zechariah,
8and Bela son of Azaz, the son of
Shema, the son of Joel. They settled in
the area from Aroer to Nebo and Baal
Meon.
9To the east they occupied the land up
to the edge of the desert that extends to
the Euphrates River, because their
livestock had increased in Gilead.
10During Saul's reign they waged war
against the Hagrites, who were defeated
at their hands; they occupied the
dwellings of the Hagrites throughout the
entire region east of Gilead.
11The Gadites lived next to them in
Bashan, as far as Salecah:
12Joel was the chief, Shapham the
second, then Janai and Shaphat, in
Bashan.
13Their relatives, by families, were:
Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai,
Jacan, Zia and Eber-seven in all.
14These were the sons of Abihail son of
Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of
Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of
Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of
Buz.
15Ahi son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, was
head of their family.
16The Gadites lived in Gilead, in Bashan
and its outlying villages, and on all the
pasturelands of Sharon as far as they
extended.
17All these were entered in the
genealogical records during the reigns
of Jotham king of Judah and Jeroboam
king of Israel.
18The Reubenites, the Gadites and the
half-tribe of Manasseh had 44,760 men
ready for military service-able-bodied
men who could handle shield and sword,
who could use a bow, and who were
trained for battle.
19They waged war against the Hagrites,
Jetur, Naphish and Nodab.
20They were helped in fighting them, and
God handed the Hagrites and all their
allies over to them, because they cried
out to him during the battle. He
answered their prayers, because they
trusted in him.
21They seized the livestock of the
Hagrites-fifty thousand camels, two
hundred fifty thousand sheep and two
thousand donkeys. They also took one
hundred thousand people captive,
22and many others fell slain, because
the battle was God's. And they occupied
the land until the exile.
23The people of the half-tribe of
Manasseh were numerous; they settled
in the land from Bashan to Baal Hermon,
that is, to Senir (Mount Hermon).
24These were the heads of their families:
Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah,
Hodaviah and Jahdiel. They were brave
warriors, famous men, and heads of
their families.
25But they were unfaithful to the God of
their fathers and prostituted themselves
to the gods of the peoples of the land,
whom God had destroyed before them.
26So the God of Israel stirred up the
spirit of Pul king of Assyria (that is,
Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria), who
took the Reubenites, the Gadites and
the half-tribe of Manasseh into exile. He
took them to Halah, Habor, Hara and
the river of Gozan, where they are to
this day.

55They were given Hebron in Judah with

32and Mikloth, who was the father of
Shimeah. They too lived near their
relatives in Jerusalem.
33Ner was the father of Kish, Kish the
father of Saul, and Saul the father of
Jonathan, Malki-Shua, Abinadab and
Esh-Baal.
34The son of Jonathan: Merib-Baal, who
was the father of Micah.
35The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech,
Tarea and Ahaz.
36Ahaz was the father of Jehoaddah,
Jehoaddah was the father of Alemeth,
Azmaveth and Zimri, and Zimri was the
father of Moza.
37Moza was the father of Binea; Raphah
was his son, Eleasah his son and Azel
his son.
38Azel had six sons, and these were
their names: Azrikam, Bokeru, Ishmael,
Sheariah, Obadiah and Hanan. All these
were the sons of Azel.
39The sons of his brother Eshek: Ulam
his firstborn, Jeush the second son and
Eliphelet the third.
40The sons of Ulam were brave warriors
who could handle the bow. They had
many sons and grandsons-150 in all. All
these were the descendants of
Benjamin.
9All Israel was listed in the
genealogies recorded in the book of the
kings of Israel. The people of Judah
were taken captive to Babylon because
of their unfaithfulness.
2Now the first to resettle on their own
property in their own towns were some
Israelites, priests, Levites and temple
servants.
3Those from Judah, from Benjamin, and
from Ephraim and Manasseh who lived
in Jerusalem were:
4Uthai son of Ammihud, the son of Omri,
the son of Imri, the son of Bani, a
descendant of Perez son of Judah.
5Of the Shilonites: Asaiah the firstborn
and his sons.
6Of the Zerahites: Jeuel. The people
from Judah numbered 690.
7Of the Benjamites: Sallu son of
Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the
son of Hassenuah;
8Ibneiah son of Jeroham; Elah son of
Uzzi, the son of Micri; and Meshullam
son of Shephatiah, the son of Reuel, the
son of Ibnijah.
9The people from Benjamin, as listed in
their genealogy, numbered 956. All
these men were heads of their families.
10Of the priests: Jedaiah; Jehoiarib;
Jakin;
11Azariah son of Hilkiah, the son of
Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of
Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the official
in charge of the house of God;
12Adaiah son of Jeroham, the son of
Pashhur, the son of Malkijah; and
Maasai son of Adiel, the son of
Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the
son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer.
13The priests, who were heads of
families, numbered 1,760. They were
able men, responsible for ministering in
the house of God.
14Of the Levites: Shemaiah son of
Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of
Hashabiah, a Merarite;
15Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal and
Mattaniah son of Mica, the son of Zicri,
the son of Asaph;
16Obadiah son of Shemaiah, the son of
Galal, the son of Jeduthun; and
Berekiah son of Asa, the son of Elkanah,
who lived in the villages of the
Netophathites.
17The gatekeepers: Shallum, Akkub,
Talmon, Ahiman and their brothers,
Shallum their chief
18being stationed at the King's Gate on
the east, up to the present time. These
were the gatekeepers belonging to the
camp of the Levites.
19Shallum son of Kore, the son of
Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his
fellow gatekeepers from his family (the
Korahites) were responsible for
guarding the thresholds of the Tent just
as their fathers had been responsible for
guarding the entrance to the dwelling of
the Lord .
20In earlier times Phinehas son of
Eleazar was in charge of the
gatekeepers, and the Lord was with him.
21Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was
the gatekeeper at the entrance to the
Tent of Meeting.
22Altogether, those chosen to be
gatekeepers at the thresholds numbered
212. They were registered by genealogy
in their villages. The gatekeepers had
been assigned to their positions of trust
by David and Samuel the seer.
23They and their descendants were in
charge of guarding the gates of the
house of the Lord -the house called the
Tent.
24The gatekeepers were on the four
sides: east, west, north and south.
25Their brothers in their villages had to
come from time to time and share their
duties for seven-day periods.
26But the four principal gatekeepers,
who were Levites, were entrusted with
the responsibility for the rooms and
treasuries in the house of God.
27They would spend the night stationed
around the house of God, because they
had to guard it; and they had charge of
the key for opening it each morning.
28Some of them were in charge of the
articles used in the temple service; they
counted them when they were brought
in and when they were taken out.
29Others were assigned to take care of
the furnishings and all the other articles
of the sanctuary, as well as the flour and
wine, and the oil, incense and spices.
30But some of the priests took care of
mixing the spices.
31A Levite named Mattithiah, the
firstborn son of Shallum the Korahite,
was entrusted with the responsibility for
baking the offering bread.
32Some of their Kohathite brothers were
in charge of preparing for every Sabbath
the bread set out on the table.
33Those who were musicians, heads of
Levite families, stayed in the rooms of
the temple and were exempt from other
duties because they were responsible
for the work day and night.
34All these were heads of Levite families,
chiefs as listed in their genealogy, and
they lived in Jerusalem.
35Jeiel the father of Gibeon lived in
Gibeon. His wife's name was Maacah,
36and his firstborn son was Abdon,
followed by Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab,
37Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah and Mikloth.
38Mikloth was the father of Shimeam.
They too lived near their relatives in
Jerusalem.
39Ner was the father of Kish, Kish the
father of Saul, and Saul the father of
Jonathan, Malki-Shua, Abinadab and
Esh-Baal.
40The son of Jonathan: Merib-Baal, who
was the father of Micah.
41The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech,
Tahrea and Ahaz.
42Ahaz was the father of Jadah, Jadah
was the father of Alemeth, Azmaveth
and Zimri, and Zimri was the father of
Moza.
43Moza was the father of Binea;
Rephaiah was his son, Eleasah his son
and Azel his son.
44Azel had six sons, and these were
their names: Azrikam, Bokeru, Ishmael,
Sheariah, Obadiah and Hanan. These
were the sons of Azel.
10Now the Philistines fought against
Israel; the Israelites fled before them,
and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
2The Philistines pressed hard after Saul
and his sons, and they killed his sons
Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua.
3The fighting grew fierce around Saul,
and when the archers overtook him,
they wounded him.
4Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw
your sword and run me through, or
these uncircumcised fellows will come
and abuse me." But his armor-bearer
was terrified and would not do it; so Saul
took his own sword and fell on it.
5When the armor-bearer saw that Saul
was dead, he too fell on his sword and
died.
6So Saul and his three sons died, and all
his house died together.
7When all the Israelites in the valley saw
that the army had fled and that Saul and
his sons had died, they abandoned their
towns and fled. And the Philistines came
and occupied them.
8The next day, when the Philistines
came to strip the dead, they found Saul
and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
9They stripped him and took his head
and his armor, and sent messengers
throughout the land of the Philistines to
proclaim the news among their idols and
their people.
10They put his armor in the temple of
their gods and hung up his head in the
temple of Dagon.
11When all the inhabitants of Jabesh
Gilead heard of everything the
Philistines had done to Saul,
12all their valiant men went and took the
bodies of Saul and his sons and brought
them to Jabesh. Then they buried their
bones under the great tree in Jabesh,
and they fasted seven days.
13Saul died because he was unfaithful to
the Lord ; he did not keep the word of
the Lord and even consulted a medium
for guidance,
14and did not inquire of the Lord . So the
Lord put him to death and turned the
kingdom over to David son of Jesse.
11All Israel came together to David
at Hebron and said, "We are your own
flesh and blood.
2In the past, even while Saul was king,
you were the one who led Israel on their
military campaigns. And the Lord your
God said to you, 'You will shepherd my
people Israel, and you will become their
ruler.' "
3When all the elders of Israel had come
to King David at Hebron, he made a
compact with them at Hebron before the
Lord , and they anointed David king over
Israel, as the Lord had promised
through Samuel.
4David and all the Israelites marched to
Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). The
Jebusites who lived there
5said to David, "You will not get in here."
Nevertheless, David captured the
fortress of Zion, the City of David.
6David had said, "Whoever leads the
attack on the Jebusites will become
commander-in-chief." Joab son of
Zeruiah went up first, and so he
received the command.
7David then took up residence in the
fortress, and so it was called the City of
David.
8He built up the city around it, from the
supporting terraces to the surrounding
wall, while Joab restored the rest of the
city.
9And David became more and more
powerful, because the Lord Almighty
was with him.
10These were the chiefs of David's
mighty men-they, together with all Israel,
gave his kingship strong support to
extend it over the whole land, as the
Lord had promised-
11this is the list of David's mighty men:
Jashobeam, a Hacmonite, was chief of
the officers ; he raised his spear against
three hundred men, whom he killed in
one encounter.
12Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai
the Ahohite, one of the three mighty
men.
13He was with David at Pas Dammim
when the Philistines gathered there for
battle. At a place where there was a
field full of barley, the troops fled from
the Philistines.
14But they took their stand in the middle
of the field. They defended it and struck
the Philistines down, and the Lord
brought about a great victory.
15Three of the thirty chiefs came down to
David to the rock at the cave of Adullam,
while a band of Philistines was
encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
16At that time David was in the
stronghold, and the Philistine garrison
was at Bethlehem.
17David longed for water and said, "Oh,
that someone would get me a drink of
water from the well near the gate of
Bethlehem!"
18So the Three broke through the
Philistine lines, drew water from the well
near the gate of Bethlehem and carried
it back to David. But he refused to drink
it; instead, he poured it out before the
Lord .
19"God forbid that I should do this!" he
said. "Should I drink the blood of these
men who went at the risk of their lives?"
Because they risked their lives to bring it
back, David would not drink it. Such
were the exploits of the three mighty
men.
20Abishai the brother of Joab was chief
of the Three. He raised his spear
against three hundred men, whom he
killed, and so he became as famous as
the Three.
21He was doubly honored above the
Three and became their commander,
even though he was not included among
them.
22Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant
fighter from Kabzeel, who performed
great exploits. He struck down two of
Moab's best men. He also went down
into a pit on a snowy day and killed a
lion.
23And he struck down an Egyptian who
was seven and a half feet tall. Although
the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver's
rod in his hand, Benaiah went against
him with a club. He snatched the spear
from the Egyptian's hand and killed him
with his own spear.
24Such were the exploits of Benaiah son
of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as
the three mighty men.
25He was held in greater honor than any
of the Thirty, but he was not included
among the Three. And David put him in
charge of his bodyguard.
26The mighty men were: Asahel the
brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo
from Bethlehem,
27Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the
Pelonite,
28Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa, Abiezer
from Anathoth,
29Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the
Ahohite,
30Maharai the Netophathite, Heled son
of Baanah the Netophathite,
31Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah in
Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
32Hurai from the ravines of Gaash, Abiel
the Arbathite,
33Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the
Shaalbonite,
34the sons of Hashem the Gizonite,
Jonathan son of Shagee the Hararite,
35Ahiam son of Sacar the Hararite,
Eliphal son of Ur,
36Hepher the Mekerathite, Ahijah the
Pelonite,
37Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai son of
Ezbai,
38Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar son
of Hagri,
39Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the
Berothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son
of Zeruiah,
40Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
41Uriah the Hittite, Zabad son of Ahlai,
42Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, who
was chief of the Reubenites, and the
thirty with him,
43Hanan son of Maacah, Joshaphat the
Mithnite,
44Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and
Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,
45Jediael son of Shimri, his brother Joha
the Tizite,
46Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and
Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah
the Moabite,
47Eliel, Obed and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
12These were the men who came to
David at Ziklag, while he was banished
from the presence of Saul son of Kish
(they were among the warriors who
helped him in battle;
2they were armed with bows and were
able to shoot arrows or to sling stones
right-handed or left-handed; they were
kinsmen of Saul from the tribe of
Benjamin):
3Ahiezer their chief and Joash the sons
of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and
Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah,
Jehu the Anathothite,
4and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty
man among the Thirty, who was a
leader of the Thirty; Jeremiah, Jahaziel,
Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite,
5Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah
and Shephatiah the Haruphite;
6Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer and
Jashobeam the Korahites;
7and Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of
Jeroham from Gedor.
8Some Gadites defected to David at his
stronghold in the desert. They were
brave warriors, ready for battle and able
to handle the shield and spear. Their
faces were the faces of lions, and they
were as swift as gazelles in the
mountains.
9Ezer was the chief, Obadiah the
second in command, Eliab the third,
10Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the
fifth,
11Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
12Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
13Jeremiah the tenth and Macbannai the
eleventh.
14These Gadites were army
commanders; the least was a match for
a hundred, and the greatest for a
thousand.
15It was they who crossed the Jordan in
the first month when it was overflowing
all its banks, and they put to flight
everyone living in the valleys, to the east
and to the west.
16Other Benjamites and some men from
Judah also came to David in his
stronghold.
17David went out to meet them and said
to them, "If you have come to me in
peace, to help me, I am ready to have
you unite with me. But if you have come
to betray me to my enemies when my
hands are free from violence, may the
God of our fathers see it and judge you."
18Then the Spirit came upon Amasai,
chief of the Thirty, and he said: "We are
yours, O David! We are with you, O son
of Jesse! Success, success to you, and
success to those who help you, for your
God will help you." So David received
them and made them leaders of his
raiding bands.
19Some of the men of Manasseh
defected to David when he went with the
Philistines to fight against Saul. (He and
his men did not help the Philistines
because, after consultation, their rulers
sent him away. They said, "It will cost us
our heads if he deserts to his master
Saul.")
20When David went to Ziklag, these
were the men of Manasseh who
defected to him: Adnah, Jozabad,
Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu and
Zillethai, leaders of units of a thousand
in Manasseh.
21They helped David against raiding
bands, for all of them were brave
warriors, and they were commanders in
his army.
22Day after day men came to help David,
until he had a great army, like the army
of God.
23These are the numbers of the men
armed for battle who came to David at
Hebron to turn Saul's kingdom over to
him, as the Lord had said:
24men of Judah, carrying shield and
spear-6,800 armed for battle;
25men of Simeon, warriors ready for
battle-7,100;
26men of Levi-4,600,
27including Jehoiada, leader of the
family of Aaron, with 3,700 men,
28and Zadok, a brave young warrior,
with 22 officers from his family;
29men of Benjamin, Saul's kinsmen-
3,000, most of whom had remained
loyal to Saul's house until then;
30men of Ephraim, brave warriors,
famous in their own clans-20,800;
31men of half the tribe of Manasseh,
designated by name to come and make
David king-18,000;
32men of Issachar, who understood the
times and knew what Israel should do-
200 chiefs, with all their relatives under
their command;
33men of Zebulun, experienced soldiers
prepared for battle with every type of
weapon, to help David with undivided
loyalty-50,000;
34men of Naphtali-1,000 officers,
together with 37,000 men carrying
shields and spears;
35men of Dan, ready for battle-28,600;
36men of Asher, experienced soldiers
prepared for battle-40,000;
37and from east of the Jordan, men of
Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of
Manasseh, armed with every type of
weapon-120,000.
38All these were fighting men who
volunteered to serve in the ranks. They
came to Hebron fully determined to
make David king over all Israel. All the
rest of the Israelites were also of one
mind to make David king.
39The men spent three days there with
David, eating and drinking, for their
families had supplied provisions for
them.
40Also, their neighbors from as far away
as Issachar, Zebulun and Naphtali came
bringing food on donkeys, camels,
mules and oxen. There were plentiful
supplies of flour, fig cakes, raisin cakes,
wine, oil, cattle and sheep, for there was
joy in Israel.
13David conferred with each of his
officers, the commanders of thousands
and commanders of hundreds.
2He then said to the whole assembly of
Israel, "If it seems good to you and if it is
the will of the Lord our God, let us send
word far and wide to the rest of our
brothers throughout the territories of
Israel, and also to the priests and
Levites who are with them in their towns
and pasturelands, to come and join us.
3Let us bring the ark of our God back to
us, for we did not inquire of it during the
reign of Saul."
4The whole assembly agreed to do this,
because it seemed right to all the people.
5So David assembled all the Israelites,
from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo
Hamath, to bring the ark of God from
Kiriath Jearim.
6David and all the Israelites with him
went to Baalah of Judah (Kiriath Jearim)
to bring up from there the ark of God the
Lord , who is enthroned between the
cherubim-the ark that is called by the
Name.
7They moved the ark of God from
Abinadab's house on a new cart, with
Uzzah and Ahio guiding it.
8David and all the Israelites were
celebrating with all their might before
God, with songs and with harps, lyres,
tambourines, cymbals and trumpets.
9When they came to the threshing floor
of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to
steady the ark, because the oxen
stumbled.
10The Lord 's anger burned against
Uzzah, and he struck him down
because he had put his hand on the ark.
So he died there before God.
11Then David was angry because the
Lord 's wrath had broken out against
Uzzah, and to this day that place is
called Perez Uzzah.
12David was afraid of God that day and
asked, "How can I ever bring the ark of
God to me?"
13He did not take the ark to be with him
in the City of David. Instead, he took it
aside to the house of Obed-Edom the
Gittite.
14The ark of God remained with the
family of Obed-Edom in his house for
three months, and the Lord blessed his
household and everything he had.
14Now Hiram king of Tyre sent
messengers to David, along with cedar
logs, stonemasons and carpenters to
build a palace for him.
2And David knew that the Lord had
established him as king over Israel and
that his kingdom had been highly
exalted for the sake of his people Israel.
3In Jerusalem David took more wives
and became the father of more sons
and daughters.
4These are the names of the children
born to him there: Shammua, Shobab,
Nathan, Solomon,
5Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
6Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
7Elishama, Beeliada and Eliphelet.
8When the Philistines heard that David
had been anointed king over all Israel,
they went up in full force to search for
him, but David heard about it and went
out to meet them.
9Now the Philistines had come and
raided the Valley of Rephaim;
10so David inquired of God: "Shall I go
and attack the Philistines? Will you hand
them over to me?" The Lord answered
him, "Go, I will hand them over to you."
11So David and his men went up to Baal
Perazim, and there he defeated them.
He said, "As waters break out, God has
broken out against my enemies by my
hand." So that place was called Baal
Perazim.
12The Philistines had abandoned their
gods there, and David gave orders to
burn them in the fire.
13Once more the Philistines raided the
valley;
14so David inquired of God again, and
God answered him, "Do not go straight
up, but circle around them and attack
them in front of the balsam trees.
15As soon as you hear the sound of
marching in the tops of the balsam trees,
move out to battle, because that will
mean God has gone out in front of you
to strike the Philistine army."
16So David did as God commanded him,
and they struck down the Philistine army,
all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
17So David's fame spread throughout
every land, and the Lord made all the
nations fear him.
15After David had constructed
buildings for himself in the City of David,
he prepared a place for the ark of God
and pitched a tent for it.
2Then David said, "No one but the
Levites may carry the ark of God,
because the Lord chose them to carry
the ark of the Lord and to minister
before him forever."
3David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem
to bring up the ark of the Lord to the
place he had prepared for it.
4He called together the descendants of
Aaron and the Levites:
5From the descendants of Kohath, Uriel
the leader and 120 relatives;
6from the descendants of Merari, Asaiah
the leader and 220 relatives;
7from the descendants of Gershon, Joel
the leader and 130 relatives;
8from the descendants of Elizaphan,
Shemaiah the leader and 200 relatives;
9from the descendants of Hebron, Eliel
the leader and 80 relatives;
10from the descendants of Uzziel,
Amminadab the leader and 112 relatives.
11Then David summoned Zadok and
Abiathar the priests, and Uriel, Asaiah,
Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel and Amminadab
the Levites.
12He said to them, "You are the heads of
the Levitical families; you and your
fellow Levites are to consecrate
yourselves and bring up the ark of the
Lord , the God of Israel, to the place I
have prepared for it.
13It was because you, the Levites, did
not bring it up the first time that the Lord
our God broke out in anger against us.
We did not inquire of him about how to
do it in the prescribed way."
14So the priests and Levites consecrated
themselves in order to bring up the ark
of the Lord , the God of Israel.
15And the Levites carried the ark of God
with the poles on their shoulders, as
Moses had commanded in accordance
with the word of the Lord .
16David told the leaders of the Levites to
appoint their brothers as singers to sing
joyful songs, accompanied by musical
instruments: lyres, harps and cymbals.
17So the Levites appointed Heman son
of Joel; from his brothers, Asaph son of
Berekiah; and from their brothers the
Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah;
18and with them their brothers next in
rank: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth,
Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah,
Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-
Edom and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.
19The musicians Heman, Asaph and
Ethan were to sound the bronze
cymbals;
20Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel,
Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah and Benaiah
were to play the lyres according to
alamoth ,
21and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah,
Obed-Edom, Jeiel and Azaziah were to
play the harps, directing according to
sheminith .
22Kenaniah the head Levite was in
charge of the singing; that was his
responsibility because he was skillful at
it.
23Berekiah and Elkanah were to be
doorkeepers for the ark.
24Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel,
Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah and Eliezer
the priests were to blow trumpets before
the ark of God. Obed-Edom and Jehiah
were also to be doorkeepers for the ark.
25So David and the elders of Israel and
the commanders of units of a thousand
went to bring up the ark of the covenant
of the Lord from the house of Obed-
Edom, with rejoicing.
26Because God had helped the Levites
who were carrying the ark of the
covenant of the Lord , seven bulls and
seven rams were sacrificed.
27Now David was clothed in a robe of
fine linen, as were all the Levites who
were carrying the ark, and as were the
singers, and Kenaniah, who was in
charge of the singing of the choirs.
David also wore a linen ephod.
28So all Israel brought up the ark of the
covenant of the Lord with shouts, with
the sounding of rams' horns and
trumpets, and of cymbals, and the
playing of lyres and harps.
29As the ark of the covenant of the Lord
was entering the City of David, Michal
daughter of Saul watched from a
window. And when she saw King David
dancing and celebrating, she despised
him in her heart.
16They brought the ark of God and
set it inside the tent that David had
pitched for it, and they presented burnt
offerings and fellowship offerings before
God.
2After David had finished sacrificing the
burnt offerings and fellowship offerings,
he blessed the people in the name of
the Lord .
3Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of
dates and a cake of raisins to each
Israelite man and woman.
4He appointed some of the Levites to
minister before the ark of the Lord , to
make petition, to give thanks, and to
praise the Lord , the God of Israel:
5Asaph was the chief, Zechariah second,
then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel,
Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom
and Jeiel. They were to play the lyres
and harps, Asaph was to sound the
cymbals,
6and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests
were to blow the trumpets regularly
before the ark of the covenant of God.
7That day David first committed to
Asaph and his associates this psalm of
thanks to the Lord :
8Give thanks to the Lord , call on his
name; make known among the nations
what he has done.
9Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all
his wonderful acts.
10Glory in his holy name; let the hearts
of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
11Look to the Lord and his strength;
seek his face always.
12Remember the wonders he has done,
his miracles, and the judgments he
pronounced,
13O descendants of Israel his servant, O
sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.
14He is the Lord our God; his judgments
are in all the earth.
15He remembers his covenant forever,
the word he commanded, for a thousand
generations,
16the covenant he made with Abraham,
the oath he swore to Isaac.
17He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,
to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
18"To you I will give the land of Canaan
as the portion you will inherit."
19When they were but few in number,
few indeed, and strangers in it,
20they wandered from nation to nation,
from one kingdom to another.
21He allowed no man to oppress them;
for their sake he rebuked kings:
22"Do not touch my anointed ones; do
my prophets no harm."
23Sing to the Lord , all the earth;
proclaim his salvation day after day.
24Declare his glory among the nations,
his marvelous deeds among all peoples.
25For great is the Lord and most worthy
of praise; he is to be feared above all
gods.
26For all the gods of the nations are idols,
but the Lord made the heavens.
27Splendor and majesty are before him;
strength and joy in his dwelling place.
28Ascribe to the Lord , O families of
nations, ascribe to the Lord glory and
strength,
29ascribe to the Lord the glory due his
name. Bring an offering and come
before him; worship the Lord in the
splendor of his holiness.
30Tremble before him, all the earth! The
world is firmly established; it cannot be
moved.
31Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth
be glad; let them say among the nations,
"The Lord reigns!"
32Let the sea resound, and all that is in
it; let the fields be jubilant, and
everything in them!
33Then the trees of the forest will sing,
they will sing for joy before the Lord , for
he comes to judge the earth.
34Give thanks to the Lord , for he is
good; his love endures forever.
35Cry out, "Save us, O God our Savior;
gather us and deliver us from the
nations, that we may give thanks to your
holy name, that we may glory in your
praise."
36Praise be to the Lord , the God of
Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.
Then all the people said "Amen" and
"Praise the Lord ."
37David left Asaph and his associates
before the ark of the covenant of the
Lord to minister there regularly,
according to each day's requirements.
38He also left Obed-Edom and his sixtyeight
associates to minister with them.
Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun, and also
Hosah, were gatekeepers.
39David left Zadok the priest and his
fellow priests before the tabernacle of
the Lord at the high place in Gibeon
40to present burnt offerings to the Lord
on the altar of burnt offering regularly,
morning and evening, in accordance
with everything written in the Law of the
Lord , which he had given Israel.
41With them were Heman and Jeduthun
and the rest of those chosen and
designated by name to give thanks to
the Lord , "for his love endures forever."
42Heman and Jeduthun were
responsible for the sounding of the
trumpets and cymbals and for the
playing of the other instruments for
sacred song. The sons of Jeduthun
were stationed at the gate.
43Then all the people left, each for his
own home, and David returned home to
bless his family.
17After David was settled in his
palace, he said to Nathan the prophet,
"Here I am, living in a palace of cedar,
while the ark of the covenant of the Lord
is under a tent."
2Nathan replied to David, "Whatever you
have in mind, do it, for God is with you."
3That night the word of God came to
Nathan, saying:
4"Go and tell my servant David, 'This is
what the Lord says: You are not the one
to build me a house to dwell in.
5I have not dwelt in a house from the
day I brought Israel up out of Egypt to
this day. I have moved from one tent
site to another, from one dwelling place
to another.
6Wherever I have moved with all the
Israelites, did I ever say to any of their
leaders whom I commanded to
shepherd my people, "Why have you not
built me a house of cedar?" '
7"Now then, tell my servant David, 'This
is what the Lord Almighty says: I took
you from the pasture and from following
the flock, to be ruler over my people
Israel.
8I have been with you wherever you
have gone, and I have cut off all your
enemies from before you. Now I will
make your name like the names of the
greatest men of the earth.
9And I will provide a place for my people
Israel and will plant them so that they
can have a home of their own and no
longer be disturbed. Wicked people will
not oppress them anymore, as they did
at the beginning
10and have done ever since the time I
appointed leaders over my people Israel.
I will also subdue all your enemies. " 'I
declare to you that the Lord will build a
house for you:
11When your days are over and you go
to be with your fathers, I will raise up
your offspring to succeed you, one of
your own sons, and I will establish his
kingdom.
12He is the one who will build a house
for me, and I will establish his throne
forever.
13I will be his father, and he will be my
son. I will never take my love away from
him, as I took it away from your
predecessor.
14I will set him over my house and my
kingdom forever; his throne will be
established forever.' "
15Nathan reported to David all the words
of this entire revelation.
16Then King David went in and sat
before the Lord , and he said: "Who am I,
O Lord God, and what is my family, that
you have brought me this far?
17And as if this were not enough in your
sight, O God, you have spoken about
the future of the house of your servant.
You have looked on me as though I
were the most exalted of men, O Lord
God.
18"What more can David say to you for
honoring your servant? For you know
your servant,
19O Lord . For the sake of your servant
and according to your will, you have
done this great thing and made known
all these great promises.
20"There is no one like you, O Lord , and
there is no God but you, as we have
heard with our own ears.
21And who is like your people Israel-the
one nation on earth whose God went
out to redeem a people for himself, and
to make a name for yourself, and to
perform great and awesome wonders by
driving out nations from before your
people, whom you redeemed from
Egypt?
22You made your people Israel your very
own forever, and you, O Lord , have
become their God.
23"And now, Lord , let the promise you
have made concerning your servant and
his house be established forever. Do as
you promised,
24so that it will be established and that
your name will be great forever. Then
men will say, 'The Lord Almighty, the
God over Israel, is Israel's God!' And the
house of your servant David will be
established before you.
25"You, my God, have revealed to your
servant that you will build a house for
him. So your servant has found courage
to pray to you.
26O Lord , you are God! You have
promised these good things to your
servant.
27Now you have been pleased to bless
the house of your servant, that it may
continue forever in your sight; for you, O
Lord , have blessed it, and it will be
blessed forever."
18In the course of time, David
defeated the Philistines and subdued
them, and he took Gath and its
surrounding villages from the control of
the Philistines.
2David also defeated the Moabites, and
they became subject to him and brought
tribute.
3Moreover, David fought Hadadezer
king of Zobah, as far as Hamath, when
he went to establish his control along
the Euphrates River.
4David captured a thousand of his
chariots, seven thousand charioteers
and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He
hamstrung all but a hundred of the
chariot horses.
5When the Arameans of Damascus
came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah,
David struck down twenty-two thousand
of them.
6He put garrisons in the Aramean
kingdom of Damascus, and the
Arameans became subject to him and
brought tribute. The Lord gave David
victory everywhere he went.
7David took the gold shields carried by
the officers of Hadadezer and brought
them to Jerusalem.
8From Tebah and Cun, towns that
belonged to Hadadezer, David took a
great quantity of bronze, which Solomon
used to make the bronze Sea, the pillars
and various bronze articles.
9When Tou king of Hamath heard that
David had defeated the entire army of
Hadadezer king of Zobah,
10he sent his son Hadoram to King
David to greet him and congratulate him
on his victory in battle over Hadadezer,
who had been at war with Tou.
Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of
gold and silver and bronze.
11King David dedicated these articles to
the Lord , as he had done with the silver
and gold he had taken from all these
nations: Edom and Moab, the
Ammonites and the Philistines, and
Amalek.
12Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down
eighteen thousand Edomites in the
Valley of Salt.
13He put garrisons in Edom, and all the
Edomites became subject to David. The
Lord gave David victory everywhere he
went.
14David reigned over all Israel, doing
what was just and right for all his people.
15Joab son of Zeruiah was over the
army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was
recorder;
16Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech
son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha
was secretary;
17Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the
Kerethites and Pelethites; and David's
sons were chief officials at the king's
side.
19In the course of time, Nahash king
of the Ammonites died, and his son
succeeded him as king.
2David thought, "I will show kindness to
Hanun son of Nahash, because his
father showed kindness to me." So
David sent a delegation to express his
sympathy to Hanun concerning his
father. When David's men came to
Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to
express sympathy to him,
3the Ammonite nobles said to Hanun,
"Do you think David is honoring your
father by sending men to you to express
sympathy? Haven't his men come to you
to explore and spy out the country and
overthrow it?"
4So Hanun seized David's men, shaved
them, cut off their garments in the
middle at the buttocks, and sent them
away.
5When someone came and told David
about the men, he sent messengers to
meet them, for they were greatly
humiliated. The king said, "Stay at
Jericho till your beards have grown, and
then come back."
6When the Ammonites realized that they
had become a stench in David's nostrils,
Hanun and the Ammonites sent a
thousand talents of silver to hire chariots
and charioteers from Aram Naharaim,
Aram Maacah and Zobah.
7They hired thirty-two thousand chariots
and charioteers, as well as the king of
Maacah with his troops, who came and
camped near Medeba, while the
Ammonites were mustered from their
towns and moved out for battle.
8On hearing this, David sent Joab out
with the entire army of fighting men.
9The Ammonites came out and drew up
in battle formation at the entrance to
their city, while the kings who had come
were by themselves in the open country.
10Joab saw that there were battle lines
in front of him and behind him; so he
selected some of the best troops in
Israel and deployed them against the
Arameans.
11He put the rest of the men under the
command of Abishai his brother, and
they were deployed against the
Ammonites.
12Joab said, "If the Arameans are too
strong for me, then you are to rescue
me; but if the Ammonites are too strong
for you, then I will rescue you.
13Be strong and let us fight bravely for
our people and the cities of our God.
The Lord will do what is good in his
sight."
14Then Joab and the troops with him
advanced to fight the Arameans, and
they fled before him.
15When the Ammonites saw that the
Arameans were fleeing, they too fled
before his brother Abishai and went
inside the city. So Joab went back to
Jerusalem.
16After the Arameans saw that they had
been routed by Israel, they sent
messengers and had Arameans brought
from beyond the River, with Shophach
the commander of Hadadezer's army
leading them.
17When David was told of this, he
gathered all Israel and crossed the
Jordan; he advanced against them and
formed his battle lines opposite them.
David formed his lines to meet the
Arameans in battle, and they fought
against him.
18But they fled before Israel, and David
killed seven thousand of their
charioteers and forty thousand of their
foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach
the commander of their army.
19When the vassals of Hadadezer saw
that they had been defeated by Israel,
they made peace with David and
became subject to him. So the
Arameans were not willing to help the
Ammonites anymore.
20In the spring, at the time when
kings go off to war, Joab led out the
armed forces. He laid waste the land of
the Ammonites and went to Rabbah and
besieged it, but David remained in
Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and
left it in ruins.
2David took the crown from the head of
their king -its weight was found to be a
talent of gold, and it was set with
precious stones-and it was placed on
David's head. He took a great quantity
of plunder from the city
3and brought out the people who were
there, consigning them to labor with
saws and with iron picks and axes.
David did this to all the Ammonite towns.
Then David and his entire army returned
to Jerusalem.
4In the course of time, war broke out
with the Philistines, at Gezer. At that
time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed
Sippai, one of the descendants of the
Rephaites, and the Philistines were
subjugated.
5In another battle with the Philistines,
Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the
brother of Goliath the Gittite, who had a
spear with a shaft like a weaver's rod.
6In still another battle, which took place
at Gath, there was a huge man with six
fingers on each hand and six toes on
each foot-twenty-four in all. He also was
descended from Rapha.
7When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son
of Shimea, David's brother, killed him.
8These were descendants of Rapha in
Gath, and they fell at the hands of David
and his men.
21Satan rose up against Israel and
incited David to take a census of Israel.
2So David said to Joab and the
commanders of the troops, "Go and
count the Israelites from Beersheba to
Dan. Then report back to me so that I
may know how many there are."
3But Joab replied, "May the Lord
multiply his troops a hundred times over.
My lord the king, are they not all my
lord's subjects? Why does my lord want
to do this? Why should he bring guilt on
Israel?"
4The king's word, however, overruled
Joab; so Joab left and went throughout
Israel and then came back to Jerusalem.
5Joab reported the number of the
fighting men to David: In all Israel there
were one million one hundred thousand
men who could handle a sword,
including four hundred and seventy
thousand in Judah.
6But Joab did not include Levi and
Benjamin in the numbering, because the
king's command was repulsive to him.
7This command was also evil in the sight
of God; so he punished Israel.
8Then David said to God, "I have sinned
greatly by doing this. Now, I beg you,
take away the guilt of your servant. I
have done a very foolish thing."
9The Lord said to Gad, David's seer,
10"Go and tell David, 'This is what the
Lord says: I am giving you three options.
Choose one of them for me to carry out
against you.' "
11So Gad went to David and said to him,
"This is what the Lord says: 'Take your
choice:
12three years of famine, three months of
being swept away before your enemies,
with their swords overtaking you, or
three days of the sword of the Lord -
days of plague in the land, with the
angel of the Lord ravaging every part of
Israel.' Now then, decide how I should
answer the one who sent me."
13David said to Gad, "I am in deep
distress. Let me fall into the hands of the
Lord , for his mercy is very great; but do
not let me fall into the hands of men."
14So the Lord sent a plague on Israel,
and seventy thousand men of Israel fell
dead.
15And God sent an angel to destroy
Jerusalem. But as the angel was doing
so, the Lord saw it and was grieved
because of the calamity and said to the
angel who was destroying the people,
"Enough! Withdraw your hand." The
angel of the Lord was then standing at
the threshing floor of Araunah the
Jebusite.
16David looked up and saw the angel of
the Lord standing between heaven and
earth, with a drawn sword in his hand
extended over Jerusalem. Then David
and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell
facedown.
17David said to God, "Was it not I who
ordered the fighting men to be counted?
I am the one who has sinned and done
wrong. These are but sheep. What have
they done? O Lord my God, let your
hand fall upon me and my family, but do
not let this plague remain on your
people."
18Then the angel of the Lord ordered
Gad to tell David to go up and build an
altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of
Araunah the Jebusite.
19So David went up in obedience to the
word that Gad had spoken in the name
of the Lord .
20While Araunah was threshing wheat,
he turned and saw the angel; his four
sons who were with him hid themselves.
21Then David approached, and when
Araunah looked and saw him, he left the
threshing floor and bowed down before
David with his face to the ground.
22David said to him, "Let me have the
site of your threshing floor so I can build
an altar to the Lord , that the plague on
the people may be stopped. Sell it to me
at the full price."
23Araunah said to David, "Take it! Let
my lord the king do whatever pleases
him. Look, I will give the oxen for the
burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for
the wood, and the wheat for the grain
offering. I will give all this."
24But King David replied to Araunah, "No,
I insist on paying the full price. I will not
take for the Lord what is yours, or
sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me
nothing."
25So David paid Araunah six hundred
shekels of gold for the site.
26David built an altar to the Lord there
and sacrificed burnt offerings and
fellowship offerings. He called on the
Lord , and the Lord answered him with
fire from heaven on the altar of burnt
offering.
27Then the Lord spoke to the angel, and
he put his sword back into its sheath.
28At that time, when David saw that the
Lord had answered him on the threshing
floor of Araunah the Jebusite, he offered
sacrifices there.
29The tabernacle of the Lord , which
Moses had made in the desert, and the
altar of burnt offering were at that time
on the high place at Gibeon.
30But David could not go before it to
inquire of God, because he was afraid of
the sword of the angel of the Lord .
22Then David said, "The house of
the Lord God is to be here, and also the
altar of burnt offering for Israel."
2So David gave orders to assemble the
aliens living in Israel, and from among
them he appointed stonecutters to
prepare dressed stone for building the
house of God.
3He provided a large amount of iron to
make nails for the doors of the gateways
and for the fittings, and more bronze
than could be weighed.
4He also provided more cedar logs than
could be counted, for the Sidonians and
Tyrians had brought large numbers of
them to David.
5David said, "My son Solomon is young
and inexperienced, and the house to be
built for the Lord should be of great
magnificence and fame and splendor in
the sight of all the nations. Therefore I
will make preparations for it." So David
made extensive preparations before his
death.
6Then he called for his son Solomon and
charged him to build a house for the
Lord , the God of Israel.
7David said to Solomon: "My son, I had
it in my heart to build a house for the
Name of the Lord my God.
8But this word of the Lord came to me:
'You have shed much blood and have
fought many wars. You are not to build a
house for my Name, because you have
shed much blood on the earth in my
sight.
9But you will have a son who will be a
man of peace and rest, and I will give
him rest from all his enemies on every
side. His name will be Solomon, and I
will grant Israel peace and quiet during
his reign.
10He is the one who will build a house
for my Name. He will be my son, and I
will be his father. And I will establish the
throne of his kingdom over Israel
forever.'
11"Now, my son, the Lord be with you,
and may you have success and build
the house of the Lord your God, as he
said you would.
12May the Lord give you discretion and
understanding when he puts you in
command over Israel, so that you may
keep the law of the Lord your God.
13Then you will have success if you are
careful to observe the decrees and laws
that the Lord gave Moses for Israel. Be
strong and courageous. Do not be afraid
or discouraged.
14"I have taken great pains to provide for
the temple of the Lord a hundred
thousand talents of gold, a million
talents of silver, quantities of bronze and
iron too great to be weighed, and wood
and stone. And you may add to them.
15You have many workmen:
stonecutters, masons and carpenters,
as well as men skilled in every kind of
work
16in gold and silver, bronze and ironcraftsmen
beyond number. Now begin
the work, and the Lord be with you."
17Then David ordered all the leaders of
Israel to help his son Solomon.
18He said to them, "Is not the Lord your
God with you? And has he not granted
you rest on every side? For he has
handed the inhabitants of the land over
to me, and the land is subject to the
Lord and to his people.
19Now devote your heart and soul to
seeking the Lord your God. Begin to
build the sanctuary of the Lord God, so
that you may bring the ark of the
covenant of the Lord and the sacred
articles belonging to God into the temple
that will be built for the Name of the
Lord ."
23When David was old and full of
years, he made his son Solomon king
over Israel.
2He also gathered together all the
leaders of Israel, as well as the priests
and Levites.
3The Levites thirty years old or more
were counted, and the total number of
men was thirty-eight thousand.
4David said, "Of these, twenty-four
thousand are to supervise the work of
the temple of the Lord and six thousand
are to be officials and judges.
5Four thousand are to be gatekeepers
and four thousand are to praise the Lord
with the musical instruments I have
provided for that purpose."
6David divided the Levites into groups
corresponding to the sons of Levi:
Gershon, Kohath and Merari.
7Belonging to the Gershonites: Ladan
and Shimei.
8The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the first,
Zetham and Joel-three in all.
9The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel
and Haran-three in all. These were the
heads of the families of Ladan.
10And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Ziza,
Jeush and Beriah. These were the sons
of Shimei-four in all.
11Jahath was the first and Ziza the
second, but Jeush and Beriah did not
have many sons; so they were counted
as one family with one assignment.
12The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar,
Hebron and Uzziel-four in all.
13The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses.
Aaron was set apart, he and his
descendants forever, to consecrate the
most holy things, to offer sacrifices
before the Lord , to minister before him
and to pronounce blessings in his name
forever.
14The sons of Moses the man of God
were counted as part of the tribe of Levi.
15The sons of Moses: Gershom and
Eliezer.
16The descendants of Gershom:
Shubael was the first.
17The descendants of Eliezer: Rehabiah
was the first. Eliezer had no other sons,
but the sons of Rehabiah were very
numerous.
18The sons of Izhar: Shelomith was the
first.
19The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first,
Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third
and Jekameam the fourth.
20The sons of Uzziel: Micah the first and
Isshiah the second.
21The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.
The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
22Eleazar died without having sons: he
had only daughters. Their cousins, the
sons of Kish, married them.
23The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder and
Jerimoth-three in all.
24These were the descendants of Levi
by their families-the heads of families as
they were registered under their names
and counted individually, that is, the
workers twenty years old or more who
served in the temple of the Lord .
25For David had said, "Since the Lord ,
the God of Israel, has granted rest to his
people and has come to dwell in
Jerusalem forever,
26the Levites no longer need to carry the
tabernacle or any of the articles used in
its service."
27According to the last instructions of
David, the Levites were counted from
those twenty years old or more.
28The duty of the Levites was to help
Aaron's descendants in the service of
the temple of the Lord : to be in charge
of the courtyards, the side rooms, the
purification of all sacred things and the
performance of other duties at the
house of God.
29They were in charge of the bread set
out on the table, the flour for the grain
offerings, the unleavened wafers, the
baking and the mixing, and all
measurements of quantity and size.
30They were also to stand every morning
to thank and praise the Lord . They were
to do the same in the evening
31and whenever burnt offerings were
presented to the Lord on Sabbaths and
at New Moon festivals and at appointed
feasts. They were to serve before the
Lord regularly in the proper number and
in the way prescribed for them.
32And so the Levites carried out their
responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting,
for the Holy Place and, under their
brothers the descendants of Aaron, for
the service of the temple of the Lord .
24These were the divisions of the
sons of Aaron: The sons of Aaron were
Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
2But Nadab and Abihu died before their
father did, and they had no sons; so
Eleazar and Ithamar served as the
priests.
3With the help of Zadok a descendant of
Eleazar and Ahimelech a descendant of
Ithamar, David separated them into
divisions for their appointed order of
ministering.
4A larger number of leaders were found
among Eleazar's descendants than
among Ithamar's, and they were divided
accordingly: sixteen heads of families
from Eleazar's descendants and eight
heads of families from Ithamar's
descendants.
5They divided them impartially by
drawing lots, for there were officials of
the sanctuary and officials of God
among the descendants of both Eleazar
and Ithamar.
6The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel,
a Levite, recorded their names in the
presence of the king and of the officials:
Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of
Abiathar and the heads of families of the
priests and of the Levites-one family
being taken from Eleazar and then one
from Ithamar.
7The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second
to Jedaiah,
8the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
9the fifth to Malkijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
10the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to
Abijah,
11the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to
Shecaniah,
12the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to
Jakim,
13the thirteenth to Huppah, the
fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
14the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to
Immer,
15the seventeenth to Hezir, the
eighteenth to Happizzez,
16the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the
twentieth to Jehezkel,
17the twenty-first to Jakin, the twentysecond
to Gamul,
18the twenty-third to Delaiah and the
twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
19This was their appointed order of
ministering when they entered the
temple of the Lord , according to the
regulations prescribed for them by their
forefather Aaron, as the Lord , the God
of Israel, had commanded him.
20As for the rest of the descendants of
Levi: from the sons of Amram: Shubael;
from the sons of Shubael: Jehdeiah.
21As for Rehabiah, from his sons:
Isshiah was the first.
22From the Izharites: Shelomoth; from
the sons of Shelomoth: Jahath.
23The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first,
Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third
and Jekameam the fourth.
24The son of Uzziel: Micah; from the
sons of Micah: Shamir.
25The brother of Micah: Isshiah; from the
sons of Isshiah: Zechariah.
26The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.
The son of Jaaziah: Beno.
27The sons of Merari: from Jaaziah:
Beno, Shoham, Zaccur and Ibri.
28From Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.
29From Kish: the son of Kish: Jerahmeel.
30And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder
and Jerimoth. These were the Levites,
according to their families.
31They also cast lots, just as their
brothers the descendants of Aaron did,
in the presence of King David and of
Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of
families of the priests and of the Levites.
The families of the oldest brother were
treated the same as those of the
youngest.
25David, together with the
commanders of the army, set apart
some of the sons of Asaph, Heman and
Jeduthun for the ministry of prophesying,
accompanied by harps, lyres and
cymbals. Here is the list of the men who
performed this service:
2From the sons of Asaph: Zaccur,
Joseph, Nethaniah and Asarelah. The
sons of Asaph were under the
supervision of Asaph, who prophesied
under the king's supervision.
3As for Jeduthun, from his sons:
Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei,
Hashabiah and Mattithiah, six in all,
under the supervision of their father
Jeduthun, who prophesied, using the
harp in thanking and praising the Lord .
4As for Heman, from his sons: Bukkiah,
Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shubael and
Jerimoth; Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah,
Giddalti and Romamti-Ezer;
Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir and
Mahazioth.
5All these were sons of Heman the
king's seer. They were given him
through the promises of God to exalt
him. God gave Heman fourteen sons
and three daughters.
6All these men were under the
supervision of their fathers for the music
of the temple of the Lord , with cymbals,
lyres and harps, for the ministry at the
house of God. Asaph, Jeduthun and
Heman were under the supervision of
the king.
7Along with their relatives-all of them
trained and skilled in music for the Lord
-they numbered 288.
8Young and old alike, teacher as well as
student, cast lots for their duties.
9The first lot, which was for Asaph, fell to
Joseph, his sons and relatives, 12 the

firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah

the firstborn, Jehozabad the second,
Joah the third, Sacar the fourth,
Nethanel the fifth,
5Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh
and Peullethai the eighth. (For God had
blessed Obed-Edom.)
6His son Shemaiah also had sons, who
were leaders in their father's family
because they were very capable men.
7The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael,
Obed and Elzabad; his relatives Elihu
and Semakiah were also able men.
8All these were descendants of Obed-
Edom; they and their sons and their
relatives were capable men with the
strength to do the work-descendants of
Obed-Edom, 62 in all.
9Meshelemiah had sons and relatives,
who were able men-18 in all.
10Hosah the Merarite had sons: Shimri
the first (although he was not the
firstborn, his father had appointed him
the first),
11Hilkiah the second, Tabaliah the third
and Zechariah the fourth. The sons and
relatives of Hosah were 13 in all.
12These divisions of the gatekeepers,
through their chief men, had duties for
ministering in the temple of the Lord ,
just as their relatives had.
13Lots were cast for each gate,
according to their families, young and
old alike.
14The lot for the East Gate fell to
Shelemiah. Then lots were cast for his
son Zechariah, a wise counselor, and
the lot for the North Gate fell to him.
15The lot for the South Gate fell to Obed-
Edom, and the lot for the storehouse fell
to his sons.
16The lots for the West Gate and the
Shalleketh Gate on the upper road fell to
Shuppim and Hosah. Guard was

17There were six Levites a day on the
east, four a day on the north, four a day
on the south and two at a time at the
storehouse.
18As for the court to the west, there were
four at the road and two at the court
itself.
19These were the divisions of the
gatekeepers who were descendants of
Korah and Merari.
20Their fellow Levites were in charge of
the treasuries of the house of God and
the treasuries for the dedicated things.
21The descendants of Ladan, who were
Gershonites through Ladan and who
were heads of families belonging to
Ladan the Gershonite, were Jehieli,
22the sons of Jehieli, Zetham and his
brother Joel. They were in charge of the
treasuries of the temple of the Lord .
23From the Amramites, the Izharites, the
Hebronites and the Uzzielites:
24Shubael, a descendant of Gershom
son of Moses, was the officer in charge
of the treasuries.
25His relatives through Eliezer:
Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son,
Joram his son, Zicri his son and
Shelomith his son.
26Shelomith and his relatives were in
charge of all the treasuries for the things
dedicated by King David, by the heads
of families who were the commanders of
thousands and commanders of
hundreds, and by the other army
commanders.
27Some of the plunder taken in battle
they dedicated for the repair of the
temple of the Lord .
28And everything dedicated by Samuel
the seer and by Saul son of Kish, Abner
son of Ner and Joab son of Zeruiah, and
all the other dedicated things were in the
care of Shelomith and his relatives.
29From the Izharites: Kenaniah and his
sons were assigned duties away from
the temple, as officials and judges over
Israel.
30From the Hebronites: Hashabiah and
his relatives-seventeen hundred able
men-were responsible in Israel west of
the Jordan for all the work of the Lord
and for the king's service.
31As for the Hebronites, Jeriah was their
chief according to the genealogical
records of their families. In the fortieth
year of David's reign a search was
made in the records, and capable men
among the Hebronites were found at
Jazer in Gilead.
32Jeriah had twenty-seven hundred
relatives, who were able men and heads
of families, and King David put them in
charge of the Reubenites, the Gadites
and the half-tribe of Manasseh for every
matter pertaining to God and for the
affairs of the king.
27This is the list of the Israelitesheads
of families, commanders of
thousands and commanders of
hundreds, and their officers, who served
the king in all that concerned the army
divisions that were on duty month by
month throughout the year. Each
division consisted of 24,000 men.
2In charge of the first division, for the
first month, was Jashobeam son of
Zabdiel. There were 24,000 men in his
division.
3He was a descendant of Perez and
chief of all the army officers for the first

These were the officers over the tribes
of Israel.
23David did not take the number of the
men twenty years old or less, because
the Lord had promised to make Israel as
numerous as the stars in the sky.
24Joab son of Zeruiah began to count
the men but did not finish. Wrath came
on Israel on account of this numbering,
and the number was not entered in the
book of the annals of King David.
25Azmaveth son of Adiel was in charge
of the royal storehouses. Jonathan son

counselor, a man of insight and a scribe.
Jehiel son of Hacmoni took care of the
king's sons.
33Ahithophel was the king's counselor.
Hushai the Arkite was the king's friend.
34Ahithophel was succeeded by
Jehoiada son of Benaiah and by
Abiathar. Joab was the commander of
the royal army.
28David summoned all the officials
of Israel to assemble at Jerusalem: the
officers over the tribes, the commanders
of the divisions in the service of the king,
the commanders of thousands and
commanders of hundreds, and the
officials in charge of all the property and
livestock belonging to the king and his
sons, together with the palace officials,
the mighty men and all the brave
warriors.
2King David rose to his feet and said:
"Listen to me, my brothers and my
people. I had it in my heart to build a
house as a place of rest for the ark of
the covenant of the Lord , for the
footstool of our God, and I made plans
to build it.
3But God said to me, 'You are not to
build a house for my Name, because
you are a warrior and have shed blood.'
4"Yet the Lord , the God of Israel, chose
me from my whole family to be king over
Israel forever. He chose Judah as
leader, and from the house of Judah he
chose my family, and from my father's
sons he was pleased to make me king
over all Israel.
5Of all my sons-and the Lord has given
me many-he has chosen my son
Solomon to sit on the throne of the
kingdom of the Lord over Israel.
6He said to me: 'Solomon your son is
the one who will build my house and my
courts, for I have chosen him to be my
son, and I will be his father.
7I will establish his kingdom forever if he
is unswerving in carrying out my
commands and laws, as is being done
at this time.'
8"So now I charge you in the sight of all
Israel and of the assembly of the Lord ,
and in the hearing of our God: Be
careful to follow all the commands of the
Lord your God, that you may possess
this good land and pass it on as an
inheritance to your descendants forever.
9"And you, my son Solomon,
acknowledge the God of your father,
and serve him with wholehearted
devotion and with a willing mind, for the
Lord searches every heart and
understands every motive behind the
thoughts. If you seek him, he will be
found by you; but if you forsake him, he
will reject you forever.
10Consider now, for the Lord has chosen
you to build a temple as a sanctuary. Be
strong and do the work."
11Then David gave his son Solomon the
plans for the portico of the temple, its
buildings, its storerooms, its upper parts,
its inner rooms and the place of
atonement.
12He gave him the plans of all that the
Spirit had put in his mind for the courts
of the temple of the Lord and all the
surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of
the temple of God and for the treasuries
for the dedicated things.
13He gave him instructions for the
divisions of the priests and Levites, and
for all the work of serving in the temple
of the Lord , as well as for all the articles
to be used in its service.
14He designated the weight of gold for
all the gold articles to be used in various
kinds of service, and the weight of silver
for all the silver articles to be used in
various kinds of service:
15the weight of gold for the gold
lampstands and their lamps, with the
weight for each lampstand and its
lamps; and the weight of silver for each
silver lampstand and its lamps,
according to the use of each lampstand;
16the weight of gold for each table for
consecrated bread; the weight of silver
for the silver tables;
17the weight of pure gold for the forks,
sprinkling bowls and pitchers; the weight
of gold for each gold dish; the weight of
silver for each silver dish;
18and the weight of the refined gold for
the altar of incense. He also gave him
the plan for the chariot, that is, the
cherubim of gold that spread their wings
and shelter the ark of the covenant of
the Lord .
19"All this," David said, "I have in writing
from the hand of the Lord upon me, and
he gave me understanding in all the
details of the plan."
20David also said to Solomon his son,
"Be strong and courageous, and do the
work. Do not be afraid or discouraged,
for the Lord God, my God, is with you.
He will not fail you or forsake you until
all the work for the service of the temple
of the Lord is finished.
21The divisions of the priests and Levites
are ready for all the work on the temple
of God, and every willing man skilled in
any craft will help you in all the work.
The officials and all the people will obey
your every command."
29Then King David said to the whole
assembly: "My son Solomon, the one
whom God has chosen, is young and
inexperienced. The task is great,
because this palatial structure is not for
man but for the Lord God.
2With all my resources I have provided
for the temple of my God-gold for the
gold work, silver for the silver, bronze for
the bronze, iron for the iron and wood
for the wood, as well as onyx for the
settings, turquoise, stones of various
colors, and all kinds of fine stone and
marble-all of these in large quantities.
3Besides, in my devotion to the temple
of my God I now give my personal
treasures of gold and silver for the
temple of my God, over and above
everything I have provided for this holy
temple:
4three thousand talents of gold (gold of
Ophir) and seven thousand talents of
refined silver, for the overlaying of the
walls of the buildings,
5for the gold work and the silver work,
and for all the work to be done by the
craftsmen. Now, who is willing to
consecrate himself today to the Lord ?"
6Then the leaders of families, the
officers of the tribes of Israel, the
commanders of thousands and
commanders of hundreds, and the
officials in charge of the king's work
gave willingly.
7They gave toward the work on the
temple of God five thousand talents and
ten thousand darics of gold, ten
thousand talents of silver, eighteen
thousand talents of bronze and a
hundred thousand talents of iron.
8Any who had precious stones gave
them to the treasury of the temple of the
Lord in the custody of Jehiel the
Gershonite.
9The people rejoiced at the willing
response of their leaders, for they had
given freely and wholeheartedly to the
Lord . David the king also rejoiced
greatly.
10David praised the Lord in the presence
of the whole assembly, saying, "Praise
be to you, O Lord , God of our father
Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.
11Yours, O Lord , is the greatness and
the power and the glory and the majesty
and the splendor, for everything in
heaven and earth is yours. Yours, O
Lord , is the kingdom; you are exalted
as head over all.
12Wealth and honor come from you; you
are the ruler of all things. In your hands
are strength and power to exalt and give
strength to all.
13Now, our God, we give you thanks,
and praise your glorious name.
14"But who am I, and who are my people,
that we should be able to give as
generously as this? Everything comes
from you, and we have given you only
what comes from your hand.
15We are aliens and strangers in your
sight, as were all our forefathers. Our
days on earth are like a shadow, without
hope.
16O Lord our God, as for all this
abundance that we have provided for
building you a temple for your Holy
Name, it comes from your hand, and all
of it belongs to you.
17I know, my God, that you test the heart
and are pleased with integrity. All these
things have I given willingly and with
honest intent. And now I have seen with
joy how willingly your people who are
here have given to you.
18O Lord , God of our fathers Abraham,
Isaac and Israel, keep this desire in the
hearts of your people forever, and keep
their hearts loyal to you.
19And give my son Solomon the
wholehearted devotion to keep your
commands, requirements and decrees
and to do everything to build the palatial
structure for which I have provided."
20Then David said to the whole
assembly, "Praise the Lord your God."
So they all praised the Lord , the God of
their fathers; they bowed low and fell
prostrate before the Lord and the king.
21The next day they made sacrifices to
the Lord and presented burnt offerings
to him: a thousand bulls, a thousand
rams and a thousand male lambs,
together with their drink offerings, and
other sacrifices in abundance for all
Israel.
22They ate and drank with great joy in
the presence of the Lord that day. Then
they acknowledged Solomon son of
David as king a second time, anointing
him before the Lord to be ruler and
Zadok to be priest.
23So Solomon sat on the throne of the
Lord as king in place of his father David.
He prospered and all Israel obeyed him.
24All the officers and mighty men, as
well as all of King David's sons, pledged
their submission to King Solomon.
25The Lord highly exalted Solomon in
the sight of all Israel and bestowed on
him royal splendor such as no king over
Israel ever had before.
26David son of Jesse was king over all
Israel.
27He ruled over Israel forty years-seven
in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.
28He died at a good old age, having
enjoyed long life, wealth and honor. His
son Solomon succeeded him as king.
29As for the events of King David's reign,
from beginning to end, they are written
in the records of Samuel the seer, the
records of Nathan the prophet and the
records of Gad the seer,
30together with the details of his reign
and power, and the circumstances that
surrounded him and Israel and the
kingdoms of all the other lands.
2nd Chronicles
1Solomon son of David established
himself firmly over his kingdom, for the
Lord his God was with him and made
him exceedingly great.
2Then Solomon spoke to all Israel-to the
commanders of thousands and
commanders of hundreds, to the judges
and to all the leaders in Israel, the
heads of families-
3and Solomon and the whole assembly
went to the high place at Gibeon, for
God's Tent of Meeting was there, which
Moses the Lord 's servant had made in
the desert.
4Now David had brought up the ark of
God from Kiriath Jearim to the place he
had prepared for it, because he had
pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.
5But the bronze altar that Bezalel son of
Uri, the son of Hur, had made was in
Gibeon in front of the tabernacle of the
Lord ; so Solomon and the assembly
inquired of him there.
6Solomon went up to the bronze altar
before the Lord in the Tent of Meeting
and offered a thousand burnt offerings
on it.
7That night God appeared to Solomon
and said to him, "Ask for whatever you
want me to give you."
8Solomon answered God, "You have
shown great kindness to David my
father and have made me king in his
place.
9Now, Lord God, let your promise to my
father David be confirmed, for you have
made me king over a people who are as
numerous as the dust of the earth.
10Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I
may lead this people, for who is able to
govern this great people of yours?"
11God said to Solomon, "Since this is
your heart's desire and you have not
asked for wealth, riches or honor, nor for
the death of your enemies, and since
you have not asked for a long life but for
wisdom and knowledge to govern my
people over whom I have made you king,
12therefore wisdom and knowledge will
be given you. And I will also give you
wealth, riches and honor, such as no
king who was before you ever had and
none after you will have."
13Then Solomon went to Jerusalem from
the high place at Gibeon, from before
the Tent of Meeting. And he reigned
over Israel.
14Solomon accumulated chariots and
horses; he had fourteen hundred
chariots and twelve thousand horses,
which he kept in the chariot cities and
also with him in Jerusalem.
15The king made silver and gold as
common in Jerusalem as stones, and
cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees
in the foothills.
16Solomon's horses were imported from
Egypt and from Kue - the royal
merchants purchased them from Kue.
17They imported a chariot from Egypt for
six hundred shekels of silver, and a
horse for a hundred and fifty. They also
exported them to all the kings of the
Hittites and of the Arameans.
2Solomon gave orders to build a
temple for the Name of the Lord and a
royal palace for himself.
2He conscripted seventy thousand men
as carriers and eighty thousand as
stonecutters in the hills and thirty-six
hundred as foremen over them.
3Solomon sent this message to Hiram
king of Tyre: "Send me cedar logs as
you did for my father David when you
sent him cedar to build a palace to live
in.
4Now I am about to build a temple for
the Name of the Lord my God and to
dedicate it to him for burning fragrant
incense before him, for setting out the
consecrated bread regularly, and for
making burnt offerings every morning
and evening and on Sabbaths and New
Moons and at the appointed feasts of
the Lord our God. This is a lasting
ordinance for Israel.
5"The temple I am going to build will be
great, because our God is greater than
all other gods.
6But who is able to build a temple for
him, since the heavens, even the
highest heavens, cannot contain him?
Who then am I to build a temple for him,
except as a place to burn sacrifices
before him?
7"Send me, therefore, a man skilled to
work in gold and silver, bronze and iron,
and in purple, crimson and blue yarn,
and experienced in the art of engraving,
to work in Judah and Jerusalem with my
skilled craftsmen, whom my father David
provided.
8"Send me also cedar, pine and algum
logs from Lebanon, for I know that your
men are skilled in cutting timber there.
My men will work with yours
9to provide me with plenty of lumber,
because the temple I build must be
large and magnificent.
10I will give your servants, the
woodsmen who cut the timber, twenty
thousand cors of ground wheat, twenty
thousand cors of barley, twenty
thousand baths of wine and twenty
thousand baths of olive oil."
11Hiram king of Tyre replied by letter to
Solomon: "Because the Lord loves his
people, he has made you their king."
12And Hiram added: "Praise be to the
Lord , the God of Israel, who made
heaven and earth! He has given King
David a wise son, endowed with
intelligence and discernment, who will
build a temple for the Lord and a palace
for himself.
13"I am sending you Huram-Abi, a man
of great skill,
14whose mother was from Dan and
whose father was from Tyre. He is
trained to work in gold and silver, bronze
and iron, stone and wood, and with
purple and blue and crimson yarn and
fine linen. He is experienced in all kinds
of engraving and can execute any
design given to him. He will work with
your craftsmen and with those of my
Lord , David your father.
15"Now let my Lord send his servants
the wheat and barley and the olive oil
and wine he promised,
16and we will cut all the logs from
Lebanon that you need and will float
them in rafts by sea down to Joppa. You
can then take them up to Jerusalem."
17Solomon took a census of all the
aliens who were in Israel, after the
census his father David had taken; and
they were found to be 153,600.
18He assigned 70,000 of them to be
carriers and 80,000 to be stonecutters in
the hills, with 3,600 foremen over them
to keep the people working.
3Then Solomon began to build the
temple of the Lord in Jerusalem on
Mount Moriah, where the Lord had
appeared to his father David. It was on
the threshing floor of Araunah the
Jebusite, the place provided by David.
2He began building on the second day of
the second month in the fourth year of
his reign.
3The foundation Solomon laid for
building the temple of God was sixty
cubits long and twenty cubits wide
(using the cubit of the old standard).
4The portico at the front of the temple
was twenty cubits long across the width
of the building and twenty cubits high.
He overlaid the inside with pure gold.
5He paneled the main hall with pine and
covered it with fine gold and decorated it
with palm tree and chain designs.
6He adorned the temple with precious
stones. And the gold he used was gold
of Parvaim.
7He overlaid the ceiling beams,
doorframes, walls and doors of the
temple with gold, and he carved
cherubim on the walls.
8He built the Most Holy Place, its length
corresponding to the width of the
temple-twenty cubits long and twenty
cubits wide. He overlaid the inside with
six hundred talents of fine gold.
9The gold nails weighed fifty shekels. He
also overlaid the upper parts with gold.
10In the Most Holy Place he made a pair
of sculptured cherubim and overlaid
them with gold.
11The total wingspan of the cherubim
was twenty cubits. One wing of the first
cherub was five cubits long and touched
the temple wall, while its other wing,
also five cubits long, touched the wing of
the other cherub.
12Similarly one wing of the second
cherub was five cubits long and touched
the other temple wall, and its other wing,
also five cubits long, touched the wing of
the first cherub.
13The wings of these cherubim extended
twenty cubits. They stood on their feet,
facing the main hall.
14He made the curtain of blue, purple
and crimson yarn and fine linen, with
cherubim worked into it.
15In the front of the temple he made two
pillars, which together were thirty-five
cubits long, each with a capital on top
measuring five cubits.
16He made interwoven chains and put
them on top of the pillars. He also made
a hundred pomegranates and attached
them to the chains.
17He erected the pillars in the front of the
temple, one to the south and one to the
north. The one to the south he named
Jakin and the one to the north Boaz.
4He made a bronze altar twenty cubits
long, twenty cubits wide and ten cubits
high.
2He made the Sea of cast metal, circular
in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim
to rim and five cubits high. It took a line
of thirty cubits to measure around it.
3Below the rim, figures of bulls encircled
it-ten to a cubit. The bulls were cast in
two rows in one piece with the Sea.
4The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three
facing north, three facing west, three
facing south and three facing east. The
Sea rested on top of them, and their
hindquarters were toward the center.
5It was a handbreadth in thickness, and
its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a
lily blossom. It held three thousand
baths.
6He then made ten basins for washing
and placed five on the south side and
five on the north. In them the things to
be used for the burnt offerings were
rinsed, but the Sea was to be used by
the priests for washing.
7He made ten gold lampstands
according to the specifications for them
and placed them in the temple, five on
the south side and five on the north.
8He made ten tables and placed them in
the temple, five on the south side and
five on the north. He also made a
hundred gold sprinkling bowls.
9He made the courtyard of the priests,
and the large court and the doors for the
court, and overlaid the doors with
bronze.
10He placed the Sea on the south side,
at the southeast corner.
11He also made the pots and shovels
and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished
the work he had undertaken for King
Solomon in the temple of God:
12the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped
capitals on top of the pillars; the two
sets of network decorating the two bowlshaped
capitals on top of the pillars;
13the four hundred pomegranates for the
two sets of network (two rows of
pomegranates for each network,
decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on
top of the pillars);
14the stands with their basins;
15the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;
16the pots, shovels, meat forks and all
related articles. All the objects that
Huram-Abi made for King Solomon for
the temple of the Lord were of polished
bronze.
17The king had them cast in clay molds
in the plain of the Jordan between
Succoth and Zarethan.
18All these things that Solomon made
amounted to so much that the weight of
the bronze was not determined.
19Solomon also made all the furnishings
that were in God's temple: the golden
altar; the tables on which was the bread
of the Presence;
20the lampstands of pure gold with their
lamps, to burn in front of the inner
sanctuary as prescribed;
21the gold floral work and lamps and
tongs (they were solid gold);
22the pure gold wick trimmers, sprinkling
bowls, dishes and censers; and the gold
doors of the temple: the inner doors to
the Most Holy Place and the doors of
the main hall.
5When all the work Solomon had done
for the temple of the Lord was finished,
he brought in the things his father David
had dedicated-the silver and gold and all
the furnishings-and he placed them in
the treasuries of God's temple.
2Then Solomon summoned to
Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the
heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the
Israelite families, to bring up the ark of
the Lord 's covenant from Zion, the City
of David.
3And all the men of Israel came together
to the king at the time of the festival in
the seventh month.
4When all the elders of Israel had
arrived, the Levites took up the ark,
5and they brought up the ark and the
Tent of Meeting and all the sacred
furnishings in it. The priests, who were
Levites, carried them up;
6and King Solomon and the entire
assembly of Israel that had gathered
about him were before the ark,
sacrificing so many sheep and cattle
that they could not be recorded or
counted.
7The priests then brought the ark of the
Lord 's covenant to its place in the inner
sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy
Place, and put it beneath the wings of
the cherubim.
8The cherubim spread their wings over
the place of the ark and covered the ark
and its carrying poles.
9These poles were so long that their
ends, extending from the ark, could be
seen from in front of the inner sanctuary,
but not from outside the Holy Place; and
they are still there today.
10There was nothing in the ark except
the two tablets that Moses had placed in
it at Horeb, where the Lord made a
covenant with the Israelites after they
came out of Egypt.
11The priests then withdrew from the
Holy Place. All the priests who were
there had consecrated themselves,
regardless of their divisions.
12All the Levites who were musicians-
Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun and their sons
and relatives-stood on the east side of
the altar, dressed in fine linen and
playing cymbals, harps and lyres. They
were accompanied by 120 priests
sounding trumpets.
13The trumpeters and singers joined in
unison, as with one voice, to give praise
and thanks to the Lord . Accompanied
by trumpets, cymbals and other
instruments, they raised their voices in
praise to the Lord and sang: "He is
good; his love endures forever." Then
the temple of the Lord was filled with a
cloud,
14and the priests could not perform their
service because of the cloud, for the
glory of the Lord filled the temple of God.
6Then Solomon said, "The Lord has
said that he would dwell in a dark cloud;
2I have built a magnificent temple for
you, a place for you to dwell forever."
3While the whole assembly of Israel was
standing there, the king turned around
and blessed them.
4Then he said: "Praise be to the Lord ,
the God of Israel, who with his hands
has fulfilled what he promised with his
mouth to my father David. For he said,
5'Since the day I brought my people out
of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any
tribe of Israel to have a temple built for
my Name to be there, nor have I chosen
anyone to be the leader over my people
Israel.
6But now I have chosen Jerusalem for
my Name to be there, and I have
chosen David to rule my people Israel.'
7"My father David had it in his heart to
build a temple for the Name of the Lord ,
the God of Israel.
8But the Lord said to my father David,
'Because it was in your heart to build a
temple for my Name, you did well to
have this in your heart.
9Nevertheless, you are not the one to
build the temple, but your son, who is
your own flesh and blood-he is the one
who will build the temple for my Name.'
10"The Lord has kept the promise he
made. I have succeeded David my
father and now I sit on the throne of
Israel, just as the Lord promised, and I
have built the temple for the Name of
the Lord , the God of Israel.
11There I have placed the ark, in which
is the covenant of the Lord that he made
with the people of Israel."
12Then Solomon stood before the altar
of the Lord in front of the whole
assembly of Israel and spread out his
hands.
13Now he had made a bronze platform,
five cubits long, five cubits wide and
three cubits high, and had placed it in
the center of the outer court. He stood
on the platform and then knelt down
before the whole assembly of Israel and
spread out his hands toward heaven.
14He said: "O Lord , God of Israel, there
is no God like you in heaven or on
earth-you who keep your covenant of
love with your servants who continue
wholeheartedly in your way.
15You have kept your promise to your
servant David my father; with your
mouth you have promised and with your
hand you have fulfilled it-as it is today.
16"Now Lord , God of Israel, keep for
your servant David my father the
promises you made to him when you
said, 'You shall never fail to have a man
to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if
only your sons are careful in all they do
to walk before me according to my law,
as you have done.'
17And now, O Lord , God of Israel, let
your word that you promised your
servant David come true.
18"But will God really dwell on earth with
men? The heavens, even the highest
heavens, cannot contain you. How
much less this temple I have built!
19Yet give attention to your servant's
prayer and his plea for mercy, O Lord
my God. Hear the cry and the prayer
that your servant is praying in your
presence.
20May your eyes be open toward this
temple day and night, this place of
which you said you would put your
Name there. May you hear the prayer
your servant prays toward this place.
21Hear the supplications of your servant
and of your people Israel when they
pray toward this place. Hear from
heaven, your dwelling place; and when
you hear, forgive.
22"When a man wrongs his neighbor and
is required to take an oath and he
comes and swears the oath before your
altar in this temple,
23then hear from heaven and act. Judge
between your servants, repaying the
guilty by bringing down on his own head
what he has done. Declare the innocent
not guilty and so establish his innocence.
24"When your people Israel have been
defeated by an enemy because they
have sinned against you and when they
turn back and confess your name,
praying and making supplication before
you in this temple,
25then hear from heaven and forgive the
sin of your people Israel and bring them
back to the land you gave to them and
their fathers.
26"When the heavens are shut up and
there is no rain because your people
have sinned against you, and when they
pray toward this place and confess your
name and turn from their sin because
you have afflicted them,
27then hear from heaven and forgive the
sin of your servants, your people Israel.
Teach them the right way to live, and
send rain on the land you gave your
people for an inheritance.
28"When famine or plague comes to the
land, or blight or mildew, locusts or
grasshoppers, or when enemies
besiege them in any of their cities,
whatever disaster or disease may come,
29and when a prayer or plea is made by
any of your people Israel-each one
aware of his afflictions and pains, and
spreading out his hands toward this
temple-
30then hear from heaven, your dwelling
place. Forgive, and deal with each man
according to all he does, since you know
his heart (for you alone know the hearts
of men),
31so that they will fear you and walk in
your ways all the time they live in the
land you gave our fathers.
32"As for the foreigner who does not
belong to your people Israel but has
come from a distant land because of
your great name and your mighty hand
and your outstretched arm-when he
comes and prays toward this temple,
33then hear from heaven, your dwelling
place, and do whatever the foreigner
asks of you, so that all the peoples of
the earth may know your name and fear
you, as do your own people Israel, and
may know that this house I have built
bears your Name.
34"When your people go to war against
their enemies, wherever you send them,
and when they pray to you toward this
city you have chosen and the temple I
have built for your Name,
35then hear from heaven their prayer
and their plea, and uphold their cause.
36"When they sin against you-for there is
no one who does not sin-and you
become angry with them and give them
over to the enemy, who takes them
captive to a land far away or near;
37and if they have a change of heart in
the land where they are held captive,
and repent and plead with you in the
land of their captivity and say, 'We have
sinned, we have done wrong and acted
wickedly';
38and if they turn back to you with all
their heart and soul in the land of their
captivity where they were taken, and
pray toward the land you gave their
fathers, toward the city you have chosen
and toward the temple I have built for
your Name;
39then from heaven, your dwelling place,
hear their prayer and their pleas, and
uphold their cause. And forgive your
people, who have sinned against you.
40"Now, my God, may your eyes be
open and your ears attentive to the
prayers offered in this place.
41"Now arise, O Lord God, and come to
your resting place, you and the ark of
your might. May your priests, O Lord
God, be clothed with salvation, may
your saints rejoice in your goodness.
42O Lord God, do not reject your
anointed one. Remember the great love
promised to David your servant."
7When Solomon finished praying, fire
came down from heaven and consumed
the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and
the glory of the Lord filled the temple.
2The priests could not enter the temple
of the Lord because the glory of the
Lord filled it.
3When all the Israelites saw the fire
coming down and the glory of the Lord
above the temple, they knelt on the
pavement with their faces to the ground,
and they worshiped and gave thanks to
the Lord , saying, "He is good; his love
endures forever."
4Then the king and all the people offered
sacrifices before the Lord .
5And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of
twenty-two thousand head of cattle and
a hundred and twenty thousand sheep
and goats. So the king and all the
people dedicated the temple of God.
6The priests took their positions, as did
the Levites with the Lord 's musical
instruments, which King David had
made for praising the Lord and which
were used when he gave thanks, saying,
"His love endures forever." Opposite the
Levites, the priests blew their trumpets,
and all the Israelites were standing.
7Solomon consecrated the middle part
of the courtyard in front of the temple of
the Lord , and there he offered burnt
offerings and the fat of the fellowship
offerings, because the bronze altar he
had made could not hold the burnt
offerings, the grain offerings and the fat
portions.
8So Solomon observed the festival at
that time for seven days, and all Israel
with him-a vast assembly, people from
Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt.
9On the eighth day they held an
assembly, for they had celebrated the
dedication of the altar for seven days
and the festival for seven days more.
10On the twenty-third day of the seventh
month he sent the people to their homes,
joyful and glad in heart for the good
things the Lord had done for David and
Solomon and for his people Israel.
11When Solomon had finished the
temple of the Lord and the royal palace,
and had succeeded in carrying out all he
had in mind to do in the temple of the
Lord and in his own palace,
12the Lord appeared to him at night and
said: "I have heard your prayer and
have chosen this place for myself as a
temple for sacrifices.
13"When I shut up the heavens so that
there is no rain, or command locusts to
devour the land or send a plague among
my people,
14if my people, who are called by my
name, will humble themselves and pray
and seek my face and turn from their
wicked ways, then will I hear from
heaven and will forgive their sin and will
heal their land.
15Now my eyes will be open and my
ears attentive to the prayers offered in
this place.
16I have chosen and consecrated this
temple so that my Name may be there
forever. My eyes and my heart will
always be there.
17"As for you, if you walk before me as
David your father did, and do all I
command, and observe my decrees and
laws,
18I will establish your royal throne, as I
covenanted with David your father when
I said, 'You shall never fail to have a
man to rule over Israel.'
19"But if you turn away and forsake the
decrees and commands I have given
you and go off to serve other gods and
worship them,
20then I will uproot Israel from my land,
which I have given them, and will reject
this temple I have consecrated for my
Name. I will make it a byword and an
object of ridicule among all peoples.
21And though this temple is now so
imposing, all who pass by will be
appalled and say, 'Why has the Lord
done such a thing to this land and to this
temple?'
22People will answer, 'Because they
have forsaken the Lord , the God of their
fathers, who brought them out of Egypt,
and have embraced other gods,
worshiping and serving them-that is why
he brought all this disaster on them.' "
8At the end of twenty years, during
which Solomon built the temple of the
Lord and his own palace,
2Solomon rebuilt the villages that Hiram
had given him, and settled Israelites in
them.
3Solomon then went to Hamath Zobah
and captured it.
4He also built up Tadmor in the desert
and all the store cities he had built in
Hamath.
5He rebuilt Upper Beth Horon and Lower
Beth Horon as fortified cities, with walls
and with gates and bars,
6as well as Baalath and all his store
cities, and all the cities for his chariots
and for his horses -whatever he desired
to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon and
throughout all the territory he ruled.
7All the people left from the Hittites,
Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and
Jebusites (these peoples were not
Israelites),
8that is, their descendants remaining in
the land, whom the Israelites had not
destroyed-these Solomon conscripted
for his slave labor force, as it is to this
day.
9But Solomon did not make slaves of the
Israelites for his work; they were his
fighting men, commanders of his
captains, and commanders of his
chariots and charioteers.
10They were also King Solomon's chief
officials-two hundred and fifty officials
supervising the men.
11Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter
up from the City of David to the palace
he had built for her, for he said, "My wife
must not live in the palace of David king
of Israel, because the places the ark of
the Lord has entered are holy."
12On the altar of the Lord that he had
built in front of the portico, Solomon
sacrificed burnt offerings to the Lord ,
13according to the daily requirement for
offerings commanded by Moses for
Sabbaths, New Moons and the three
annual feasts-the Feast of Unleavened
Bread, the Feast of Weeks and the
Feast of Tabernacles.
14In keeping with the ordinance of his
father David, he appointed the divisions
of the priests for their duties, and the
Levites to lead the praise and to assist
the priests according to each day's
requirement. He also appointed the
gatekeepers by divisions for the various
gates, because this was what David the
man of God had ordered.
15They did not deviate from the king's
commands to the priests or to the
Levites in any matter, including that of
the treasuries.
16All Solomon's work was carried out,
from the day the foundation of the
temple of the Lord was laid until its
completion. So the temple of the Lord
was finished.
17Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber
and Elath on the coast of Edom.
18And Hiram sent him ships commanded
by his own officers, men who knew the
sea. These, with Solomon's men, sailed
to Ophir and brought back four hundred
and fifty talents of gold, which they
delivered to King Solomon.
9When the queen of Sheba heard of
Solomon's fame, she came to
Jerusalem to test him with hard
questions. Arriving with a very great
caravan-with camels carrying spices,
large quantities of gold, and precious
stones-she came to Solomon and talked
with him about all she had on her mind.
2Solomon answered all her questions;
nothing was too hard for him to explain
to her.
3When the queen of Sheba saw the
wisdom of Solomon, as well as the
palace he had built,
4the food on his table, the seating of his
officials, the attending servants in their
robes, the cupbearers in their robes and
the burnt offerings he made at the
temple of the Lord , she was
overwhelmed.
5She said to the king, "The report I
heard in my own country about your
achievements and your wisdom is true.
6But I did not believe what they said until
I came and saw with my own eyes.
Indeed, not even half the greatness of
your wisdom was told me; you have far
exceeded the report I heard.
7How happy your men must be! How
happy your officials, who continually
stand before you and hear your wisdom!
8Praise be to the Lord your God, who
has delighted in you and placed you on
his throne as king to rule for the Lord
your God. Because of the love of your
God for Israel and his desire to uphold
them forever, he has made you king
over them, to maintain justice and
righteousness."
9Then she gave the king 120 talents of
gold, large quantities of spices, and
precious stones. There had never been
such spices as those the queen of
Sheba gave to King Solomon.
10(The men of Hiram and the men of
Solomon brought gold from Ophir; they
also brought algumwood and precious
stones.
11The king used the algumwood to make
steps for the temple of the Lord and for
the royal palace, and to make harps and
lyres for the musicians. Nothing like
them had ever been seen in Judah.)
12King Solomon gave the queen of
Sheba all she desired and asked for; he
gave her more than she had brought to
him. Then she left and returned with her
retinue to her own country.
13The weight of the gold that Solomon
received yearly was 666 talents,
14not including the revenues brought in
by merchants and traders. Also all the
kings of Arabia and the governors of the
land brought gold and silver to Solomon.
15King Solomon made two hundred
large shields of hammered gold; six
hundred bekas of hammered gold went
into each shield.
16He also made three hundred small
shields of hammered gold, with three
hundred bekas of gold in each shield.
The king put them in the Palace of the
Forest of Lebanon.
17Then the king made a great throne
inlaid with ivory and overlaid with pure
gold.
18The throne had six steps, and a
footstool of gold was attached to it. On
both sides of the seat were armrests,
with a lion standing beside each of them.
19Twelve lions stood on the six steps,
one at either end of each step. Nothing
like it had ever been made for any other
kingdom.
20All King Solomon's goblets were gold,
and all the household articles in the
Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were
pure gold. Nothing was made of silver,
because silver was considered of little
value in Solomon's day.
21The king had a fleet of trading ships
manned by Hiram's men. Once every
three years it returned, carrying gold,
silver and ivory, and apes and baboons.
22King Solomon was greater in riches
and wisdom than all the other kings of
the earth.
23All the kings of the earth sought
audience with Solomon to hear the
wisdom God had put in his heart.
24Year after year, everyone who came
brought a gift-articles of silver and gold,
and robes, weapons and spices, and
horses and mules.
25Solomon had four thousand stalls for
horses and chariots, and twelve
thousand horses, which he kept in the
chariot cities and also with him in
Jerusalem.
26He ruled over all the kings from the
River to the land of the Philistines, as far
as the border of Egypt.
27The king made silver as common in
Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as
plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the
foothills.
28Solomon's horses were imported from
Egypt and from all other countries.
29As for the other events of Solomon's
reign, from beginning to end, are they
not written in the records of Nathan the
prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the
Shilonite and in the visions of Iddo the
seer concerning Jeroboam son of
Nebat?
30Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all
Israel forty years.
31Then he rested with his fathers and
was buried in the city of David his father.
And Rehoboam his son succeeded him
as king.
10Rehoboam went to Shechem, for
all the Israelites had gone there to make
him king.
2When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard
this (he was in Egypt, where he had fled
from King Solomon), he returned from
Egypt.
3So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and
all Israel went to Rehoboam and said to
him:
4"Your father put a heavy yoke on us,
but now lighten the harsh labor and the
heavy yoke he put on us, and we will
serve you."
5Rehoboam answered, "Come back to
me in three days." So the people went
away.
6Then King Rehoboam consulted the
elders who had served his father
Solomon during his lifetime. "How would
you advise me to answer these people?"
he asked.
7They replied, "If you will be kind to
these people and please them and give
them a favorable answer, they will
always be your servants."
8But Rehoboam rejected the advice the
elders gave him and consulted the
young men who had grown up with him
and were serving him.
9He asked them, "What is your advice?
How should we answer these people
who say to me, 'Lighten the yoke your
father put on us'?"
10The young men who had grown up
with him replied, "Tell the people who
have said to you, 'Your father put a
heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke
lighter'-tell them, 'My little finger is
thicker than my father's waist.
11My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I
will make it even heavier. My father
scourged you with whips; I will scourge
you with scorpions.' "
12Three days later Jeroboam and all the
people returned to Rehoboam, as the
king had said, "Come back to me in
three days."
13The king answered them harshly.
Rejecting the advice of the elders,
14he followed the advice of the young
men and said, "My father made your
yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier.
My father scourged you with whips; I will
scourge you with scorpions."
15So the king did not listen to the people,
for this turn of events was from God, to
fulfill the word the Lord had spoken to
Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah
the Shilonite.
16When all Israel saw that the king
refused to listen to them, they answered
the king: "What share do we have in
David, what part in Jesse's son? To your
tents, O Israel! Look after your own
house, O David!" So all the Israelites
went home.
17But as for the Israelites who were
living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam
still ruled over them.
18King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram,
who was in charge of forced labor, but
the Israelites stoned him to death. King
Rehoboam, however, managed to get
into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
19So Israel has been in rebellion against
the house of David to this day.
11When Rehoboam arrived in
Jerusalem, he mustered the house of
Judah and Benjamin-a hundred and
eighty thousand fighting men-to make
war against Israel and to regain the
kingdom for Rehoboam.
2But this word of the Lord came to
Shemaiah the man of God:
3"Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon
king of Judah and to all the Israelites in
Judah and Benjamin,
4'This is what the Lord says: Do not go
up to fight against your brothers. Go
home, every one of you, for this is my
doing.' " So they obeyed the words of
the Lord and turned back from marching
against Jeroboam.
5Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built
up towns for defense in Judah:
6Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
7Beth Zur, Soco, Adullam,
8Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
9Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
10Zorah, Aijalon and Hebron. These
were fortified cities in Judah and
Benjamin.
11He strengthened their defenses and
put commanders in them, with supplies
of food, olive oil and wine.
12He put shields and spears in all the
cities, and made them very strong. So
Judah and Benjamin were his.
13The priests and Levites from all their
districts throughout Israel sided with him.
14The Levites even abandoned their
pasturelands and property, and came to
Judah and Jerusalem because
Jeroboam and his sons had rejected
them as priests of the Lord .
15And he appointed his own priests for
the high places and for the goat and calf
idols he had made.
16Those from every tribe of Israel who
set their hearts on seeking the Lord , the
God of Israel, followed the Levites to
Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the Lord ,
the God of their fathers.
17They strengthened the kingdom of
Judah and supported Rehoboam son of
Solomon three years, walking in the
ways of David and Solomon during this
time.
18Rehoboam married Mahalath, who
was the daughter of David's son
Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of
Jesse's son Eliab.
19She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah
and Zaham.
20Then he married Maacah daughter of
Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai,
Ziza and Shelomith.
21Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter of
Absalom more than any of his other
wives and concubines. In all, he had
eighteen wives and sixty concubines,
twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
22Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of
Maacah to be the chief prince among
his brothers, in order to make him king.
23He acted wisely, dispersing some of
his sons throughout the districts of
Judah and Benjamin, and to all the
fortified cities. He gave them abundant
provisions and took many wives for
them.
12After Rehoboam's position as king
was established and he had become
strong, he and all Israel with him
abandoned the law of the Lord .
2Because they had been unfaithful to the
Lord , Shishak king of Egypt attacked
Jerusalem in the fifth year of King
Rehoboam.
3With twelve hundred chariots and sixty
thousand horsemen and the
innumerable troops of Libyans, Sukkites
and Cushites that came with him from
Egypt,
4he captured the fortified cities of Judah
and came as far as Jerusalem.
5Then the prophet Shemaiah came to
Rehoboam and to the leaders of Judah
who had assembled in Jerusalem for
fear of Shishak, and he said to them,
"This is what the Lord says, 'You have
abandoned me; therefore, I now
abandon you to Shishak.' "
6The leaders of Israel and the king
humbled themselves and said, "The
Lord is just."
7When the Lord saw that they humbled
themselves, this word of the Lord came
to Shemaiah: "Since they have humbled
themselves, I will not destroy them but
will soon give them deliverance. My
wrath will not be poured out on
Jerusalem through Shishak.
8They will, however, become subject to
him, so that they may learn the
difference between serving me and
serving the kings of other lands."
9When Shishak king of Egypt attacked
Jerusalem, he carried off the treasures
of the temple of the Lord and the
treasures of the royal palace. He took
everything, including the gold shields
Solomon had made.
10So King Rehoboam made bronze
shields to replace them and assigned
these to the commanders of the guard
on duty at the entrance to the royal
palace.
11Whenever the king went to the Lord 's
temple, the guards went with him,
bearing the shields, and afterward they
returned them to the guardroom.
12Because Rehoboam humbled himself,
the Lord 's anger turned from him, and
he was not totally destroyed. Indeed,
there was some good in Judah.
13King Rehoboam established himself
firmly in Jerusalem and continued as
king. He was forty-one years old when
he became king, and he reigned
seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city
the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes
of Israel in which to put his Name. His
mother's name was Naamah; she was
an Ammonite.
14He did evil because he had not set his
heart on seeking the Lord .
15As for the events of Rehoboam's reign,
from beginning to end, are they not
written in the records of Shemaiah the
prophet and of Iddo the seer that deal
with genealogies? There was continual
warfare between Rehoboam and
Jeroboam.
16Rehoboam rested with his fathers and
was buried in the City of David. And
Abijah his son succeeded him as king.
13In the eighteenth year of the reign
of Jeroboam, Abijah became king of
Judah,
2and he reigned in Jerusalem three
years. His mother's name was Maacah,
a daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There
was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
3Abijah went into battle with a force of
four hundred thousand able fighting men,
and Jeroboam drew up a battle line
against him with eight hundred thousand
able troops.
4Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, in
the hill country of Ephraim, and said,
"Jeroboam and all Israel, listen to me!
5Don't you know that the Lord , the God
of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel
to David and his descendants forever by
a covenant of salt?
6Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, an official
of Solomon son of David, rebelled
against his master.
7Some worthless scoundrels gathered
around him and opposed Rehoboam
son of Solomon when he was young
and indecisive and not strong enough to
resist them.
8"And now you plan to resist the
kingdom of the Lord , which is in the
hands of David's descendants. You are
indeed a vast army and have with you
the golden calves that Jeroboam made
to be your gods.
9But didn't you drive out the priests of
the Lord , the sons of Aaron, and the
Levites, and make priests of your own
as the peoples of other lands do?
Whoever comes to consecrate himself
with a young bull and seven rams may
become a priest of what are not gods.
10"As for us, the Lord is our God, and we
have not forsaken him. The priests who
serve the Lord are sons of Aaron, and
the Levites assist them.
11Every morning and evening they
present burnt offerings and fragrant
incense to the Lord . They set out the
bread on the ceremonially clean table
and light the lamps on the gold
lampstand every evening. We are
observing the requirements of the Lord
our God. But you have forsaken him.
12God is with us; he is our leader. His
priests with their trumpets will sound the
battle cry against you. Men of Israel, do
not fight against the Lord , the God of
your fathers, for you will not succeed."
13Now Jeroboam had sent troops
around to the rear, so that while he was
in front of Judah the ambush was
behind them.
14Judah turned and saw that they were
being attacked at both front and rear.
Then they cried out to the Lord . The
priests blew their trumpets
15and the men of Judah raised the battle
cry. At the sound of their battle cry, God
routed Jeroboam and all Israel before
Abijah and Judah.
16The Israelites fled before Judah, and
God delivered them into their hands.
17Abijah and his men inflicted heavy
losses on them, so that there were five
hundred thousand casualties among
Israel's able men.
18The men of Israel were subdued on
that occasion, and the men of Judah
were victorious because they relied on
the Lord , the God of their fathers.
19Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took
from him the towns of Bethel, Jeshanah
and Ephron, with their surrounding
villages.
20Jeroboam did not regain power during
the time of Abijah. And the Lord struck
him down and he died.
21But Abijah grew in strength. He
married fourteen wives and had twentytwo
sons and sixteen daughters.
22The other events of Abijah's reign,
what he did and what he said, are
written in the annotations of the prophet
Iddo.
14And Abijah rested with his fathers
and was buried in the City of David. Asa
his son succeeded him as king, and in
his days the country was at peace for
ten years.
2Asa did what was good and right in the
eyes of the Lord his God.
3He removed the foreign altars and the
high places, smashed the sacred stones
and cut down the Asherah poles.
4He commanded Judah to seek the
Lord , the God of their fathers, and to
obey his laws and commands.
5He removed the high places and
incense altars in every town in Judah,
and the kingdom was at peace under
him.
6He built up the fortified cities of Judah,
since the land was at peace. No one
was at war with him during those years,
for the Lord gave him rest.
7"Let us build up these towns," he said
to Judah, "and put walls around them,
with towers, gates and bars. The land is
still ours, because we have sought the
Lord our God; we sought him and he
has given us rest on every side." So
they built and prospered.
8Asa had an army of three hundred
thousand men from Judah, equipped
with large shields and with spears, and
two hundred and eighty thousand from
Benjamin, armed with small shields and
with bows. All these were brave fighting
men.
9Zerah the Cushite marched out against
them with a vast army and three
hundred chariots, and came as far as
Mareshah.
10Asa went out to meet him, and they
took up battle positions in the Valley of
Zephathah near Mareshah.
11Then Asa called to the Lord his God
and said, "Lord , there is no one like you
to help the powerless against the mighty.
Help us, O Lord our God, for we rely on
you, and in your name we have come
against this vast army. O Lord , you are
our God; do not let man prevail against
you."
12The Lord struck down the Cushites
before Asa and Judah. The Cushites
fled,
13and Asa and his army pursued them
as far as Gerar. Such a great number of
Cushites fell that they could not recover;
they were crushed before the Lord and
his forces. The men of Judah carried off
a large amount of plunder.
14They destroyed all the villages around
Gerar, for the terror of the Lord had
fallen upon them. They plundered all
these villages, since there was much
booty there.
15They also attacked the camps of the
herdsmen and carried off droves of
sheep and goats and camels. Then they
returned to Jerusalem.
15The Spirit of God came upon
Azariah son of Oded.
2He went out to meet Asa and said to
him, "Listen to me, Asa and all Judah
and Benjamin. The Lord is with you
when you are with him. If you seek him,
he will be found by you, but if you
forsake him, he will forsake you.
3For a long time Israel was without the
true God, without a priest to teach and
without the law.
4But in their distress they turned to the
Lord , the God of Israel, and sought him,
and he was found by them.
5In those days it was not safe to travel
about, for all the inhabitants of the lands
were in great turmoil.
6One nation was being crushed by
another and one city by another,
because God was troubling them with
every kind of distress.
7But as for you, be strong and do not
give up, for your work will be rewarded."
8When Asa heard these words and the
prophecy of Azariah son of Oded the
prophet, he took courage. He removed
the detestable idols from the whole land
of Judah and Benjamin and from the
towns he had captured in the hills of
Ephraim. He repaired the altar of the
Lord that was in front of the portico of
the Lord 's temple.
9Then he assembled all Judah and
Benjamin and the people from Ephraim,
Manasseh and Simeon who had settled
among them, for large numbers had
come over to him from Israel when they
saw that the Lord his God was with him.
10They assembled at Jerusalem in the
third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's
reign.
11At that time they sacrificed to the Lord
seven hundred head of cattle and seven
thousand sheep and goats from the
plunder they had brought back.
12They entered into a covenant to seek
the Lord , the God of their fathers, with
all their heart and soul.
13All who would not seek the Lord , the
God of Israel, were to be put to death,
whether small or great, man or woman.
14They took an oath to the Lord with
loud acclamation, with shouting and with
trumpets and horns.
15All Judah rejoiced about the oath
because they had sworn it
wholeheartedly. They sought God
eagerly, and he was found by them. So
the Lord gave them rest on every side.
16King Asa also deposed his
grandmother Maacah from her position
as queen mother, because she had
made a repulsive Asherah pole. Asa cut
the pole down, broke it up and burned it
in the Kidron Valley.
17Although he did not remove the high
places from Israel, Asa's heart was fully
committed to the Lord all his life.
18He brought into the temple of God the
silver and gold and the articles that he
and his father had dedicated.
19There was no more war until the thirtyfifth
year of Asa's reign.
16In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's
reign Baasha king of Israel went up
against Judah and fortified Ramah to
prevent anyone from leaving or entering
the territory of Asa king of Judah.
2Asa then took the silver and gold out of
the treasuries of the Lord 's temple and
of his own palace and sent it to Ben-
Hadad king of Aram, who was ruling in
Damascus.
3"Let there be a treaty between me and
you," he said, "as there was between my
father and your father. See, I am
sending you silver and gold. Now break
your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so
he will withdraw from me."
4Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and
sent the commanders of his forces
against the towns of Israel. They
conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim and all
the store cities of Naphtali.
5When Baasha heard this, he stopped
building Ramah and abandoned his
work.
6Then King Asa brought all the men of
Judah, and they carried away from
Ramah the stones and timber Baasha
had been using. With them he built up
Geba and Mizpah.
7At that time Hanani the seer came to
Asa king of Judah and said to him:
"Because you relied on the king of Aram
and not on the Lord your God, the army
of the king of Aram has escaped from
your hand.
8Were not the Cushites and Libyans a
mighty army with great numbers of
chariots and horsemen ? Yet when you
relied on the Lord , he delivered them
into your hand.
9For the eyes of the Lord range
throughout the earth to strengthen those
whose hearts are fully committed to him.
You have done a foolish thing, and from
now on you will be at war."
10Asa was angry with the seer because
of this; he was so enraged that he put
him in prison. At the same time Asa
brutally oppressed some of the people.
11The events of Asa's reign, from
beginning to end, are written in the book
of the kings of Judah and Israel.
12In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa
was afflicted with a disease in his feet.
Though his disease was severe, even in
his illness he did not seek help from the
Lord , but only from the physicians.
13Then in the forty-first year of his reign
Asa died and rested with his fathers.
14They buried him in the tomb that he
had cut out for himself in the City of
David. They laid him on a bier covered
with spices and various blended
perfumes, and they made a huge fire in
his honor.
17Jehoshaphat his son succeeded
him as king and strengthened himself
against Israel.
2He stationed troops in all the fortified
cities of Judah and put garrisons in
Judah and in the towns of Ephraim that
his father Asa had captured.
3The Lord was with Jehoshaphat
because in his early years he walked in
the ways his father David had followed.
He did not consult the Baals
4but sought the God of his father and
followed his commands rather than the
practices of Israel.
5The Lord established the kingdom
under his control; and all Judah brought
gifts to Jehoshaphat, so that he had
great wealth and honor.
6His heart was devoted to the ways of
the Lord ; furthermore, he removed the
high places and the Asherah poles from
Judah.
7In the third year of his reign he sent his
officials Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah,
Nethanel and Micaiah to teach in the
towns of Judah.
8With them were certain Levites-
Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel,
Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah,
Tobijah and Tob-Adonijah-and the
priests Elishama and Jehoram.
9They taught throughout Judah, taking
with them the Book of the Law of the
Lord ; they went around to all the towns
of Judah and taught the people.
10The fear of the Lord fell on all the
kingdoms of the lands surrounding
Judah, so that they did not make war
with Jehoshaphat.
11Some Philistines brought Jehoshaphat
gifts and silver as tribute, and the Arabs
brought him flocks: seven thousand
seven hundred rams and seven
thousand seven hundred goats.
12Jehoshaphat became more and more
powerful; he built forts and store cities in
Judah
13and had large supplies in the towns of
Judah. He also kept experienced
fighting men in Jerusalem.
14Their enrollment by families was as
follows: From Judah, commanders of
units of 1,000: Adnah the commander,
with 300,000 fighting men;
15next, Jehohanan the commander, with
280,000;
16next, Amasiah son of Zicri, who
volunteered himself for the service of
the Lord , with 200,000.
17From Benjamin: Eliada, a valiant
soldier, with 200,000 men armed with
bows and shields;
18next, Jehozabad, with 180,000 men
armed for battle.
19These were the men who served the
king, besides those he stationed in the
fortified cities throughout Judah.
18Now Jehoshaphat had great
wealth and honor, and he allied himself
with Ahab by marriage.
2Some years later he went down to visit
Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered
many sheep and cattle for him and the
people with him and urged him to attack
Ramoth Gilead.
3Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat
king of Judah, "Will you go with me
against Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat
replied, "I am as you are, and my people
as your people; we will join you in the
war."
4But Jehoshaphat also said to the king
of Israel, "First seek the counsel of the
Lord ."
5So the king of Israel brought together
the prophets-four hundred men-and
asked them, "Shall we go to war against
Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?" "Go,"
they answered, "for God will give it into
the king's hand."
6But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not a
prophet of the Lord here whom we can
inquire of?"
7The king of Israel answered
Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man
through whom we can inquire of the
Lord , but I hate him because he never
prophesies anything good about me, but
always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah."
"The king should not say that,"
Jehoshaphat replied.
8So the king of Israel called one of his
officials and said, "Bring Micaiah son of
Imlah at once."
9Dressed in their royal robes, the king of
Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah
were sitting on their thrones at the
threshing floor by the entrance to the
gate of Samaria, with all the prophets
prophesying before them.
10Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had
made iron horns, and he declared, "This
is what the Lord says: 'With these you
will gore the Arameans until they are
destroyed.' "
11All the other prophets were
prophesying the same thing. "Attack
Ramoth Gilead and be victorious," they
said, "for the Lord will give it into the
king's hand."
12The messenger who had gone to
summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, as
one man the other prophets are
predicting success for the king. Let your
word agree with theirs, and speak
favorably."
13But Micaiah said, "As surely as the
Lord lives, I can tell him only what my
God says."
14When he arrived, the king asked him,
"Micaiah, shall we go to war against
Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?"
"Attack and be victorious," he answered,
"for they will be given into your hand."
15The king said to him, "How many times
must I make you swear to tell me
nothing but the truth in the name of the
Lord ?"
16Then Micaiah answered, "I saw all
Israel scattered on the hills like sheep
without a shepherd, and the Lord said,
'These people have no master. Let each
one go home in peace.' "
17The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat,
"Didn't I tell you that he never
prophesies anything good about me, but
only bad?"
18Micaiah continued, "Therefore hear the
word of the Lord : I saw the Lord sitting
on his throne with all the host of heaven
standing on his right and on his left.
19And the Lord said, 'Who will entice
Ahab king of Israel into attacking
Ramoth Gilead and going to his death
there?' "One suggested this, and
another that.
20Finally, a spirit came forward, stood
before the Lord and said, 'I will entice
him.' " 'By what means?' the Lord asked.
21" 'I will go and be a lying spirit in the
mouths of all his prophets,' he said. "
'You will succeed in enticing him,' said
the Lord . 'Go and do it.'
22"So now the Lord has put a lying spirit
in the mouths of these prophets of yours.
The Lord has decreed disaster for you."
23Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went
up and slapped Micaiah in the face.
"Which way did the spirit from the Lord
go when he went from me to speak to
you?" he asked.
24Micaiah replied, "You will find out on
the day you go to hide in an inner room."
25The king of Israel then ordered, "Take
Micaiah and send him back to Amon the
ruler of the city and to Joash the king's
son,
26and say, 'This is what the king says:
Put this fellow in prison and give him
nothing but bread and water until I
return safely.' "
27Micaiah declared, "If you ever return
safely, the Lord has not spoken through
me." Then he added, "Mark my words,
all you people!"
28So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat
king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.
29The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat,
"I will enter the battle in disguise, but
you wear your royal robes." So the king
of Israel disguised himself and went into
battle.
30Now the king of Aram had ordered his
chariot commanders, "Do not fight with
anyone, small or great, except the king
of Israel."
31When the chariot commanders saw
Jehoshaphat, they thought, "This is the
king of Israel." So they turned to attack
him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the
Lord helped him. God drew them away
from him,
32for when the chariot commanders saw
that he was not the king of Israel, they
stopped pursuing him.
33But someone drew his bow at random
and hit the king of Israel between the
sections of his armor. The king told the
chariot driver, "Wheel around and get
me out of the fighting. I've been
wounded."
34All day long the battle raged, and the
king of Israel propped himself up in his
chariot facing the Arameans until
evening. Then at sunset he died.
19When Jehoshaphat king of Judah
returned safely to his palace in
Jerusalem,
2Jehu the seer, the son of Hanani, went
out to meet him and said to the king,
"Should you help the wicked and love
those who hate the Lord ? Because of
this, the wrath of the Lord is upon you.
3There is, however, some good in you,
for you have rid the land of the Asherah
poles and have set your heart on
seeking God."
4Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and he
went out again among the people from
Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim
and turned them back to the Lord , the
God of their fathers.
5He appointed judges in the land, in
each of the fortified cities of Judah.
6He told them, "Consider carefully what
you do, because you are not judging for
man but for the Lord , who is with you
whenever you give a verdict.
7Now let the fear of the Lord be upon
you. Judge carefully, for with the Lord
our God there is no injustice or partiality
or bribery."
8In Jerusalem also, Jehoshaphat
appointed some of the Levites, priests
and heads of Israelite families to
administer the law of the Lord and to
settle disputes. And they lived in
Jerusalem.
9He gave them these orders: "You must
serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in
the fear of the Lord .
10In every case that comes before you
from your fellow countrymen who live in
the cities-whether bloodshed or other
concerns of the law, commands,
decrees or ordinances-you are to warn
them not to sin against the Lord ;
otherwise his wrath will come on you
and your brothers. Do this, and you will
not sin.
11"Amariah the chief priest will be over
you in any matter concerning the Lord ,
and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the leader
of the tribe of Judah, will be over you in
any matter concerning the king, and the
Levites will serve as officials before you.
Act with courage, and may the Lord be
with those who do well."
20After this, the Moabites and
Ammonites with some of the Meunites
came to make war on Jehoshaphat.
2Some men came and told Jehoshaphat,
"A vast army is coming against you from
Edom, from the other side of the Sea. It
is already in Hazazon Tamar" (that is,
En Gedi).
3Alarmed, Jehoshaphat resolved to
inquire of the Lord , and he proclaimed a
fast for all Judah.
4The people of Judah came together to
seek help from the Lord ; indeed, they
came from every town in Judah to seek
him.
5Then Jehoshaphat stood up in the
assembly of Judah and Jerusalem at the
temple of the Lord in the front of the new
courtyard
6and said: "O Lord , God of our fathers,
are you not the God who is in heaven?
You rule over all the kingdoms of the
nations. Power and might are in your
hand, and no one can withstand you.
7O our God, did you not drive out the
inhabitants of this land before your
people Israel and give it forever to the
descendants of Abraham your friend?
8They have lived in it and have built in it
a sanctuary for your Name, saying,
9'If calamity comes upon us, whether the
sword of judgment, or plague or famine,
we will stand in your presence before
this temple that bears your Name and
will cry out to you in our distress, and
you will hear us and save us.'
10"But now here are men from Ammon,
Moab and Mount Seir, whose territory
you would not allow Israel to invade
when they came from Egypt; so they
turned away from them and did not
destroy them.
11See how they are repaying us by
coming to drive us out of the possession
you gave us as an inheritance.
12O our God, will you not judge them?
For we have no power to face this vast
army that is attacking us. We do not
know what to do, but our eyes are upon
you."
13All the men of Judah, with their wives
and children and little ones, stood there
before the Lord .
14Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon
Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of
Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of
Mattaniah, a Levite and descendant of
Asaph, as he stood in the assembly.
15He said: "Listen, King Jehoshaphat
and all who live in Judah and
Jerusalem! This is what the Lord says to
you: 'Do not be afraid or discouraged
because of this vast army. For the battle
is not yours, but God's.
16Tomorrow march down against them.
They will be climbing up by the Pass of
Ziz, and you will find them at the end of
the gorge in the Desert of Jeruel.
17You will not have to fight this battle.
Take up your positions; stand firm and
see the deliverance the Lord will give
you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be
afraid; do not be discouraged. Go out to
face them tomorrow, and the Lord will
be with you.' "
18Jehoshaphat bowed with his face to
the ground, and all the people of Judah
and Jerusalem fell down in worship
before the Lord .
19Then some Levites from the
Kohathites and Korahites stood up and
praised the Lord , the God of Israel, with
very loud voice.
20Early in the morning they left for the
Desert of Tekoa. As they set out,
Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Listen to
me, Judah and people of Jerusalem!
Have faith in the Lord your God and you
will be upheld; have faith in his prophets
and you will be successful."
21After consulting the people,
Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to
the Lord and to praise him for the
splendor of his holiness as they went
out at the head of the army, saying:
"Give thanks to the Lord , for his love
endures forever."
22As they began to sing and praise, the
Lord set ambushes against the men of
Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who
were invading Judah, and they were
defeated.
23The men of Ammon and Moab rose up
against the men from Mount Seir to
destroy and annihilate them. After they
finished slaughtering the men from Seir,
they helped to destroy one another.
24When the men of Judah came to the
place that overlooks the desert and
looked toward the vast army, they saw
only dead bodies lying on the ground;
no one had escaped.
25So Jehoshaphat and his men went to
carry off their plunder, and they found
among them a great amount of
equipment and clothing and also articles
of value-more than they could take away.
There was so much plunder that it took
three days to collect it.
26On the fourth day they assembled in
the Valley of Beracah, where they
praised the Lord . This is why it is called
the Valley of Beracah to this day.
27Then, led by Jehoshaphat, all the men
of Judah and Jerusalem returned
joyfully to Jerusalem, for the Lord had
given them cause to rejoice over their
enemies.
28They entered Jerusalem and went to
the temple of the Lord with harps and
lutes and trumpets.
29The fear of God came upon all the
kingdoms of the countries when they
heard how the Lord had fought against
the enemies of Israel.
30And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was
at peace, for his God had given him rest
on every side.
31So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah.
He was thirty-five years old when he
became king of Judah, and he reigned
in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His
mother's name was Azubah daughter of
Shilhi.
32He walked in the ways of his father
Asa and did not stray from them; he did
what was right in the eyes of the Lord .
33The high places, however, were not
removed, and the people still had not
set their hearts on the God of their
fathers.
34The other events of Jehoshaphat's
reign, from beginning to end, are written
in the annals of Jehu son of Hanani,
which are recorded in the book of the
kings of Israel.
35Later, Jehoshaphat king of Judah
made an alliance with Ahaziah king of
Israel, who was guilty of wickedness.
36He agreed with him to construct a fleet
of trading ships. After these were built at
Ezion Geber,
37Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah
prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying,
"Because you have made an alliance
with Ahaziah, the Lord will destroy what
you have made." The ships were
wrecked and were not able to set sail to
trade.
21Then Jehoshaphat rested with his
fathers and was buried with them in the
City of David. And Jehoram his son
succeeded him as king.
2Jehoram's brothers, the sons of
Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel,
Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael and
Shephatiah. All these were sons of
Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
3Their father had given them many gifts
of silver and gold and articles of value,
as well as fortified cities in Judah, but he
had given the kingdom to Jehoram
because he was his firstborn son.
4When Jehoram established himself
firmly over his father's kingdom, he put
all his brothers to the sword along with
some of the princes of Israel.
5Jehoram was thirty-two years old when
he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem eight years.
6He walked in the ways of the kings of
Israel, as the house of Ahab had done,
for he married a daughter of Ahab. He
did evil in the eyes of the Lord .
7Nevertheless, because of the covenant
the Lord had made with David, the Lord
was not willing to destroy the house of
David. He had promised to maintain a
lamp for him and his descendants
forever.
8In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled
against Judah and set up its own king.
9So Jehoram went there with his officers
and all his chariots. The Edomites
surrounded him and his chariot
commanders, but he rose up and broke
through by night.
10To this day Edom has been in
rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted
at the same time, because Jehoram had
forsaken the Lord , the God of his
fathers.
11He had also built high places on the
hills of Judah and had caused the
people of Jerusalem to prostitute
themselves and had led Judah astray.
12Jehoram received a letter from Elijah
the prophet, which said: "This is what
the Lord , the God of your father David,
says: 'You have not walked in the ways
of your father Jehoshaphat or of Asa
king of Judah.
13But you have walked in the ways of
the kings of Israel, and you have led
Judah and the people of Jerusalem to
prostitute themselves, just as the house
of Ahab did. You have also murdered
your own brothers, members of your
father's house, men who were better
than you.
14So now the Lord is about to strike your
people, your sons, your wives and
everything that is yours, with a heavy
blow.
15You yourself will be very ill with a
lingering disease of the bowels, until the
disease causes your bowels to come
out.' "
16The Lord aroused against Jehoram the
hostility of the Philistines and of the
Arabs who lived near the Cushites.
17They attacked Judah, invaded it and
carried off all the goods found in the
king's palace, together with his sons and
wives. Not a son was left to him except
Ahaziah, the youngest.
18After all this, the Lord afflicted
Jehoram with an incurable disease of
the bowels.
19In the course of time, at the end of the
second year, his bowels came out
because of the disease, and he died in
great pain. His people made no fire in
his honor, as they had for his fathers.
20Jehoram was thirty-two years old
when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem eight years. He passed
away, to no one's regret, and was buried
in the City of David, but not in the tombs
of the kings.
22The people of Jerusalem made
Ahaziah, Jehoram's youngest son, king
in his place, since the raiders, who
came with the Arabs into the camp, had
killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son
of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.
2Ahaziah was twenty-two years old
when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem one year. His mother's
name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of
Omri.
3He too walked in the ways of the house
of Ahab, for his mother encouraged him
in doing wrong.
4He did evil in the eyes of the Lord , as
the house of Ahab had done, for after
his father's death they became his
advisers, to his undoing.
5He also followed their counsel when he
went with Joram son of Ahab king of
Israel to war against Hazael king of
Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans
wounded Joram;
6so he returned to Jezreel to recover
from the wounds they had inflicted on
him at Ramoth in his battle with Hazael
king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of
Jehoram king of Judah went down to
Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab
because he had been wounded.
7Through Ahaziah's visit to Joram, God
brought about Ahaziah's downfall. When
Ahaziah arrived, he went out with Joram
to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the
Lord had anointed to destroy the house
of Ahab.
8While Jehu was executing judgment on
the house of Ahab, he found the princes
of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's
relatives, who had been attending
Ahaziah, and he killed them.
9He then went in search of Ahaziah, and
his men captured him while he was
hiding in Samaria. He was brought to
Jehu and put to death. They buried him,
for they said, "He was a son of
Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord with
all his heart." So there was no one in the
house of Ahaziah powerful enough to
retain the kingdom.
10When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah
saw that her son was dead, she
proceeded to destroy the whole royal
family of the house of Judah.
11But Jehosheba, the daughter of King
Jehoram, took Joash son of Ahaziah
and stole him away from among the
royal princes who were about to be
murdered and put him and his nurse in a
bedroom. Because Jehosheba, the
daughter of King Jehoram and wife of
the priest Jehoiada, was Ahaziah's
sister, she hid the child from Athaliah so
she could not kill him.
12He remained hidden with them at the
temple of God for six years while
Athaliah ruled the land.
23In the seventh year Jehoiada
showed his strength. He made a
covenant with the commanders of units
of a hundred: Azariah son of Jeroham,
Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son
of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and
Elishaphat son of Zicri.
2They went throughout Judah and
gathered the Levites and the heads of
Israelite families from all the towns.
When they came to Jerusalem,
3the whole assembly made a covenant
with the king at the temple of God.
Jehoiada said to them, "The king's son
shall reign, as the Lord promised
concerning the descendants of David.
4Now this is what you are to do: A third
of you priests and Levites who are going
on duty on the Sabbath are to keep
watch at the doors,
5a third of you at the royal palace and a
third at the Foundation Gate, and all the
other men are to be in the courtyards of
the temple of the Lord .
6No one is to enter the temple of the
Lord except the priests and Levites on
duty; they may enter because they are
consecrated, but all the other men are to
guard what the Lord has assigned to
them.
7The Levites are to station themselves
around the king, each man with his
weapons in his hand. Anyone who
enters the temple must be put to death.
Stay close to the king wherever he
goes."
8The Levites and all the men of Judah
did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered.
Each one took his men-those who were
going on duty on the Sabbath and those
who were going off duty-for Jehoiada
the priest had not released any of the
divisions.
9Then he gave the commanders of units
of a hundred the spears and the large
and small shields that had belonged to
King David and that were in the temple
of God.
10He stationed all the men, each with his
weapon in his hand, around the kingnear
the altar and the temple, from the
south side to the north side of the
temple.
11Jehoiada and his sons brought out the
king's son and put the crown on him;
they presented him with a copy of the
covenant and proclaimed him king. They
anointed him and shouted, "Long live
the king!"
12When Athaliah heard the noise of the
people running and cheering the king,
she went to them at the temple of the
Lord .
13She looked, and there was the king,
standing by his pillar at the entrance.
The officers and the trumpeters were
beside the king, and all the people of the
land were rejoicing and blowing
trumpets, and singers with musical
instruments were leading the praises.
Then Athaliah tore her robes and
shouted, "Treason! Treason!"
14Jehoiada the priest sent out the
commanders of units of a hundred, who
were in charge of the troops, and said to
them: "Bring her out between the ranks
and put to the sword anyone who
follows her." For the priest had said, "Do
not put her to death at the temple of the
Lord ."
15So they seized her as she reached the
entrance of the Horse Gate on the
palace grounds, and there they put her
to death.
16Jehoiada then made a covenant that
he and the people and the king would
be the Lord 's people.
17All the people went to the temple of
Baal and tore it down. They smashed
the altars and idols and killed Mattan the
priest of Baal in front of the altars.
18Then Jehoiada placed the oversight of
the temple of the Lord in the hands of
the priests, who were Levites, to whom
David had made assignments in the
temple, to present the burnt offerings of
the Lord as written in the Law of Moses,
with rejoicing and singing, as David had
ordered.
19He also stationed doorkeepers at the
gates of the Lord 's temple so that no
one who was in any way unclean might
enter.
20He took with him the commanders of
hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the
people and all the people of the land
and brought the king down from the
temple of the Lord . They went into the
palace through the Upper Gate and
seated the king on the royal throne,
21and all the people of the land rejoiced.
And the city was quiet, because Athaliah
had been slain with the sword.
24Joash was seven years old when
he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem forty years. His mother's
name was Zibiah; she was from
Beersheba.
2Joash did what was right in the eyes of
the Lord all the years of Jehoiada the
priest.
3Jehoiada chose two wives for him, and
he had sons and daughters.
4Some time later Joash decided to
restore the temple of the Lord .
5He called together the priests and
Levites and said to them, "Go to the
towns of Judah and collect the money
due annually from all Israel, to repair the
temple of your God. Do it now." But the
Levites did not act at once.
6Therefore the king summoned
Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him,
"Why haven't you required the Levites to
bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the
tax imposed by Moses the servant of the
Lord and by the assembly of Israel for
the Tent of the Testimony?"
7Now the sons of that wicked woman
Athaliah had broken into the temple of
God and had used even its sacred
objects for the Baals.
8At the king's command, a chest was
made and placed outside, at the gate of
the temple of the Lord .
9A proclamation was then issued in
Judah and Jerusalem that they should
bring to the Lord the tax that Moses the
servant of God had required of Israel in
the desert.
10All the officials and all the people
brought their contributions gladly,
dropping them into the chest until it was
full.
11Whenever the chest was brought in by
the Levites to the king's officials and
they saw that there was a large amount
of money, the royal secretary and the
officer of the chief priest would come
and empty the chest and carry it back to
its place. They did this regularly and
collected a great amount of money.
12The king and Jehoiada gave it to the
men who carried out the work required
for the temple of the Lord . They hired
masons and carpenters to restore the
Lord 's temple, and also workers in iron
and bronze to repair the temple.
13The men in charge of the work were
diligent, and the repairs progressed
under them. They rebuilt the temple of
God according to its original design and
reinforced it.
14When they had finished, they brought
the rest of the money to the king and
Jehoiada, and with it were made articles
for the Lord 's temple: articles for the
service and for the burnt offerings, and
also dishes and other objects of gold
and silver. As long as Jehoiada lived,
burnt offerings were presented
continually in the temple of the Lord .
15Now Jehoiada was old and full of
years, and he died at the age of a
hundred and thirty.
16He was buried with the kings in the
City of David, because of the good he
had done in Israel for God and his
temple.
17After the death of Jehoiada, the
officials of Judah came and paid
homage to the king, and he listened to
them.
18They abandoned the temple of the
Lord , the God of their fathers, and
worshiped Asherah poles and idols.
Because of their guilt, God's anger
came upon Judah and Jerusalem.
19Although the Lord sent prophets to the
people to bring them back to him, and
though they testified against them, they
would not listen.
20Then the Spirit of God came upon
Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest.
He stood before the people and said,
"This is what God says: 'Why do you
disobey the Lord 's commands? You will
not prosper. Because you have forsaken
the Lord , he has forsaken you.' "
21But they plotted against him, and by
order of the king they stoned him to
death in the courtyard of the Lord 's
temple.
22King Joash did not remember the
kindness Zechariah's father Jehoiada
had shown him but killed his son, who
said as he lay dying, "May the Lord see
this and call you to account."
23At the turn of the year, the army of
Aram marched against Joash; it invaded
Judah and Jerusalem and killed all the
leaders of the people. They sent all the
plunder to their king in Damascus.
24Although the Aramean army had come
with only a few men, the Lord delivered
into their hands a much larger army.
Because Judah had forsaken the Lord ,
the God of their fathers, judgment was
executed on Joash.
25When the Arameans withdrew, they
left Joash severely wounded. His
officials conspired against him for
murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest,
and they killed him in his bed. So he
died and was buried in the City of David,
but not in the tombs of the kings.
26Those who conspired against him
were Zabad, son of Shimeath an
Ammonite woman, and Jehozabad, son
of Shimrith a Moabite woman.
27The account of his sons, the many
prophecies about him, and the record of
the restoration of the temple of God are
written in the annotations on the book of
the kings. And Amaziah his son
succeeded him as king.
25Amaziah was twenty-five years
old when he became king, and he
reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years.
His mother's name was Jehoaddin ; she
was from Jerusalem.
2He did what was right in the eyes of the
Lord , but not wholeheartedly.
3After the kingdom was firmly in his
control, he executed the officials who
had murdered his father the king.
4Yet he did not put their sons to death,
but acted in accordance with what is
written in the Law, in the Book of Moses,
where the Lord commanded: "Fathers
shall not be put to death for their
children, nor children put to death for
their fathers; each is to die for his own
sins."
5Amaziah called the people of Judah
together and assigned them according
to their families to commanders of
thousands and commanders of
hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin.
He then mustered those twenty years
old or more and found that there were
three hundred thousand men ready for
military service, able to handle the spear
and shield.
6He also hired a hundred thousand
fighting men from Israel for a hundred
talents of silver.
7But a man of God came to him and said,
"O king, these troops from Israel must
not march with you, for the Lord is not
with Israel-not with any of the people of
Ephraim.
8Even if you go and fight courageously
in battle, God will overthrow you before
the enemy, for God has the power to
help or to overthrow."
9Amaziah asked the man of God, "But
what about the hundred talents I paid for
these Israelite troops?" The man of God
replied, "The Lord can give you much
more than that."
10So Amaziah dismissed the troops who
had come to him from Ephraim and sent
them home. They were furious with
Judah and left for home in a great rage.
11Amaziah then marshaled his strength
and led his army to the Valley of Salt,
where he killed ten thousand men of
Seir.
12The army of Judah also captured ten
thousand men alive, took them to the
top of a cliff and threw them down so
that all were dashed to pieces.
13Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah
had sent back and had not allowed to
take part in the war raided Judean
towns from Samaria to Beth Horon.
They killed three thousand people and
carried off great quantities of plunder.
14When Amaziah returned from
slaughtering the Edomites, he brought
back the gods of the people of Seir. He
set them up as his own gods, bowed
down to them and burned sacrifices to
them.
15The anger of the Lord burned against
Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him,
who said, "Why do you consult this
people's gods, which could not save
their own people from your hand?"
16While he was still speaking, the king
said to him, "Have we appointed you an
adviser to the king? Stop! Why be struck
down?" So the prophet stopped but said,
"I know that God has determined to
destroy you, because you have done
this and have not listened to my
counsel."
17After Amaziah king of Judah consulted
his advisers, he sent this challenge to
Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of
Jehu, king of Israel: "Come, meet me
face to face."
18But Jehoash king of Israel replied to
Amaziah king of Judah: "A thistle in
Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in
Lebanon, 'Give your daughter to my son
in marriage.' Then a wild beast in
Lebanon came along and trampled the
thistle underfoot.
19You say to yourself that you have
defeated Edom, and now you are
arrogant and proud. But stay at home!
Why ask for trouble and cause your own
downfall and that of Judah also?"
20Amaziah, however, would not listen,
for God so worked that he might hand
them over to Jehoash , because they
sought the gods of Edom.
21So Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He
and Amaziah king of Judah faced each
other at Beth Shemesh in Judah.
22Judah was routed by Israel, and every
man fled to his home.
23Jehoash king of Israel captured
Amaziah king of Judah, the son of
Joash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth
Shemesh. Then Jehoash brought him to
Jerusalem and broke down the wall of
Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the
Corner Gate-a section about six
hundred feet long.
24He took all the gold and silver and all
the articles found in the temple of God
that had been in the care of Obed-Edom,
together with the palace treasures and
the hostages, and returned to Samaria.
25Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah
lived for fifteen years after the death of
Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
26As for the other events of Amaziah's
reign, from beginning to end, are they
not written in the book of the kings of
Judah and Israel?
27From the time that Amaziah turned
away from following the Lord , they
conspired against him in Jerusalem and
he fled to Lachish, but they sent men
after him to Lachish and killed him there.
28He was brought back by horse and
was buried with his fathers in the City of
Judah.
26Then all the people of Judah took
Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and
made him king in place of his father
Amaziah.
2He was the one who rebuilt Elath and
restored it to Judah after Amaziah
rested with his fathers.
3Uzziah was sixteen years old when he
became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother's
name was Jecoliah; she was from
Jerusalem.
4He did what was right in the eyes of the
Lord , just as his father Amaziah had
done.
5He sought God during the days of
Zechariah, who instructed him in the
fear of God. As long as he sought the
Lord , God gave him success.
6He went to war against the Philistines
and broke down the walls of Gath,
Jabneh and Ashdod. He then rebuilt
towns near Ashdod and elsewhere
among the Philistines.
7God helped him against the Philistines
and against the Arabs who lived in Gur
Baal and against the Meunites.
8The Ammonites brought tribute to
Uzziah, and his fame spread as far as
the border of Egypt, because he had
become very powerful.
9Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the
Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate and at
the angle of the wall, and he fortified
them.
10He also built towers in the desert and
dug many cisterns, because he had
much livestock in the foothills and in the
plain. He had people working his fields
and vineyards in the hills and in the
fertile lands, for he loved the soil.
11Uzziah had a well-trained army, ready
to go out by divisions according to their
numbers as mustered by Jeiel the
secretary and Maaseiah the officer
under the direction of Hananiah, one of
the royal officials.
12The total number of family leaders
over the fighting men was 2,600.
13Under their command was an army of
307,500 men trained for war, a powerful
force to support the king against his
enemies.
14Uzziah provided shields, spears,
helmets, coats of armor, bows and
slingstones for the entire army.
15In Jerusalem he made machines
designed by skillful men for use on the
towers and on the corner defenses to
shoot arrows and hurl large stones. His
fame spread far and wide, for he was
greatly helped until he became powerful.
16But after Uzziah became powerful, his
pride led to his downfall. He was
unfaithful to the Lord his God, and
entered the temple of the Lord to burn
incense on the altar of incense.
17Azariah the priest with eighty other
courageous priests of the Lord followed
him in.
18They confronted him and said, "It is
not right for you, Uzziah, to burn incense
to the Lord . That is for the priests, the
descendants of Aaron, who have been
consecrated to burn incense. Leave the
sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful;
and you will not be honored by the Lord
God."
19Uzziah, who had a censer in his hand
ready to burn incense, became angry.
While he was raging at the priests in
their presence before the incense altar
in the Lord 's temple, leprosy broke out
on his forehead.
20When Azariah the chief priest and all
the other priests looked at him, they saw
that he had leprosy on his forehead, so
they hurried him out. Indeed, he himself
was eager to leave, because the Lord
had afflicted him.
21King Uzziah had leprosy until the day
he died. He lived in a separate house -
leprous, and excluded from the temple
of the Lord . Jotham his son had charge
of the palace and governed the people
of the land.
22The other events of Uzziah's reign,
from beginning to end, are recorded by
the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
23Uzziah rested with his fathers and was
buried near them in a field for burial that
belonged to the kings, for people said,
"He had leprosy." And Jotham his son
succeeded him as king.
27Jotham was twenty-five years old
when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother's
name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok.
2He did what was right in the eyes of the
Lord , just as his father Uzziah had done,
but unlike him he did not enter the
temple of the Lord . The people,
however, continued their corrupt
practices.
3Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the
temple of the Lord and did extensive
work on the wall at the hill of Ophel.
4He built towns in the Judean hills and
forts and towers in the wooded areas.
5Jotham made war on the king of the
Ammonites and conquered them. That
year the Ammonites paid him a hundred
talents of silver, ten thousand cors of
wheat and ten thousand cors of barley.
The Ammonites brought him the same
amount also in the second and third
years.
6Jotham grew powerful because he
walked steadfastly before the Lord his
God.
7The other events in Jotham's reign,
including all his wars and the other
things he did, are written in the book of
the kings of Israel and Judah.
8He was twenty-five years old when he
became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem sixteen years.
9Jotham rested with his fathers and was
buried in the City of David. And Ahaz his
son succeeded him as king.
28Ahaz was twenty years old when
he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem sixteen years. Unlike David
his father, he did not do what was right
in the eyes of the Lord .
2He walked in the ways of the kings of
Israel and also made cast idols for
worshiping the Baals.
3He burned sacrifices in the Valley of
Ben Hinnom and sacrificed his sons in
the fire, following the detestable ways of
the nations the Lord had driven out
before the Israelites.
4He offered sacrifices and burned
incense at the high places, on the
hilltops and under every spreading tree.
5Therefore the Lord his God handed him
over to the king of Aram. The Arameans
defeated him and took many of his
people as prisoners and brought them to
Damascus. He was also given into the
hands of the king of Israel, who inflicted
heavy casualties on him.
6In one day Pekah son of Remaliah
killed a hundred and twenty thousand
soldiers in Judah-because Judah had
forsaken the Lord , the God of their
fathers.
7Zicri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed
Maaseiah the king's son, Azrikam the
officer in charge of the palace, and
Elkanah, second to the king.
8The Israelites took captive from their
kinsmen two hundred thousand wives,
sons and daughters. They also took a
great deal of plunder, which they carried
back to Samaria.
9But a prophet of the Lord named Oded
was there, and he went out to meet the
army when it returned to Samaria. He
said to them, "Because the Lord , the
God of your fathers, was angry with
Judah, he gave them into your hand.
But you have slaughtered them in a
rage that reaches to heaven.
10And now you intend to make the men
and women of Judah and Jerusalem
your slaves. But aren't you also guilty of
sins against the Lord your God?
11Now listen to me! Send back your
fellow countrymen you have taken as
prisoners, for the Lord 's fierce anger
rests on you."
12Then some of the leaders in Ephraim-
Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berekiah
son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of
Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlaiconfronted
those who were arriving from
the war.
13"You must not bring those prisoners
here," they said, "or we will be guilty
before the Lord . Do you intend to add to
our sin and guilt? For our guilt is already
great, and his fierce anger rests on
Israel."
14So the soldiers gave up the prisoners
and plunder in the presence of the
officials and all the assembly.
15The men designated by name took the
prisoners, and from the plunder they
clothed all who were naked. They
provided them with clothes and sandals,
food and drink, and healing balm. All
those who were weak they put on
donkeys. So they took them back to
their fellow countrymen at Jericho, the
City of Palms, and returned to Samaria.
16At that time King Ahaz sent to the king
of Assyria for help.
17The Edomites had again come and
attacked Judah and carried away
prisoners,
18while the Philistines had raided towns
in the foothills and in the Negev of
Judah. They captured and occupied
Beth Shemesh, Aijalon and Gederoth,
as well as Soco, Timnah and Gimzo,
with their surrounding villages.
19The Lord had humbled Judah because
of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had
promoted wickedness in Judah and had
been most unfaithful to the Lord .
20Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came to
him, but he gave him trouble instead of
help.
21Ahaz took some of the things from the
temple of the Lord and from the royal
palace and from the princes and
presented them to the king of Assyria,
but that did not help him.
22In his time of trouble King Ahaz
became even more unfaithful to the
Lord .
23He offered sacrifices to the gods of
Damascus, who had defeated him; for
he thought, "Since the gods of the kings
of Aram have helped them, I will
sacrifice to them so they will help me."
But they were his downfall and the
downfall of all Israel.
24Ahaz gathered together the furnishings
from the temple of God and took them
away. He shut the doors of the Lord 's
temple and set up altars at every street
corner in Jerusalem.
25In every town in Judah he built high
places to burn sacrifices to other gods
and provoked the Lord , the God of his
fathers, to anger.
26The other events of his reign and all
his ways, from beginning to end, are
written in the book of the kings of Judah
and Israel.
27Ahaz rested with his fathers and was
buried in the city of Jerusalem, but he
was not placed in the tombs of the kings
of Israel. And Hezekiah his son
succeeded him as king.
29Hezekiah was twenty-five years
old when he became king, and he
reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years.
His mother's name was Abijah daughter
of Zechariah.
2He did what was right in the eyes of the
Lord , just as his father David had done.
3In the first month of the first year of his
reign, he opened the doors of the
temple of the Lord and repaired them.
4He brought in the priests and the
Levites, assembled them in the square
on the east side
5and said: "Listen to me, Levites!
Consecrate yourselves now and
consecrate the temple of the Lord , the
God of your fathers. Remove all
defilement from the sanctuary.
6Our fathers were unfaithful; they did evil
in the eyes of the Lord our God and
forsook him. They turned their faces
away from the Lord 's dwelling place
and turned their backs on him.
7They also shut the doors of the portico
and put out the lamps. They did not burn
incense or present any burnt offerings at
the sanctuary to the God of Israel.
8Therefore, the anger of the Lord has
fallen on Judah and Jerusalem; he has
made them an object of dread and
horror and scorn, as you can see with
your own eyes.
9This is why our fathers have fallen by
the sword and why our sons and
daughters and our wives are in captivity.
10Now I intend to make a covenant with
the Lord , the God of Israel, so that his
fierce anger will turn away from us.
11My sons, do not be negligent now, for
the Lord has chosen you to stand before
him and serve him, to minister before
him and to burn incense."
12Then these Levites set to work: from
the Kohathites, Mahath son of Amasai
and Joel son of Azariah; from the
Merarites, Kish son of Abdi and Azariah
son of Jehallelel; from the Gershonites,
Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of
Joah;
13from the descendants of Elizaphan,
Shimri and Jeiel; from the descendants
of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
14from the descendants of Heman,
Jehiel and Shimei; from the
descendants of Jeduthun, Shemaiah
and Uzziel.
15When they had assembled their
brothers and consecrated themselves,
they went in to purify the temple of the
Lord , as the king had ordered, following
the word of the Lord .
16The priests went into the sanctuary of
the Lord to purify it. They brought out to
the courtyard of the Lord 's temple
everything unclean that they found in
the temple of the Lord . The Levites took
it and carried it out to the Kidron Valley.
17They began the consecration on the
first day of the first month, and by the
eighth day of the month they reached
the portico of the Lord . For eight more
days they consecrated the temple of the
Lord itself, finishing on the sixteenth day
of the first month.
18Then they went in to King Hezekiah
and reported: "We have purified the
entire temple of the Lord , the altar of
burnt offering with all its utensils, and
the table for setting out the consecrated
bread, with all its articles.
19We have prepared and consecrated all
the articles that King Ahaz removed in
his unfaithfulness while he was king.
They are now in front of the Lord 's
altar."
20Early the next morning King Hezekiah
gathered the city officials together and
went up to the temple of the Lord .
21They brought seven bulls, seven rams,
seven male lambs and seven male
goats as a sin offering for the kingdom,
for the sanctuary and for Judah. The
king commanded the priests, the
descendants of Aaron, to offer these on
the altar of the Lord .
22So they slaughtered the bulls, and the
priests took the blood and sprinkled it on
the altar; next they slaughtered the rams
and sprinkled their blood on the altar;
then they slaughtered the lambs and
sprinkled their blood on the altar.
23The goats for the sin offering were
brought before the king and the
assembly, and they laid their hands on
them.
24The priests then slaughtered the goats
and presented their blood on the altar
for a sin offering to atone for all Israel,
because the king had ordered the burnt
offering and the sin offering for all Israel.
25He stationed the Levites in the temple
of the Lord with cymbals, harps and
lyres in the way prescribed by David and
Gad the king's seer and Nathan the
prophet; this was commanded by the
Lord through his prophets.
26So the Levites stood ready with
David's instruments, and the priests with
their trumpets.
27Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice
the burnt offering on the altar. As the
offering began, singing to the Lord
began also, accompanied by trumpets
and the instruments of David king of
Israel.
28The whole assembly bowed in worship,
while the singers sang and the
trumpeters played. All this continued
until the sacrifice of the burnt offering
was completed.
29When the offerings were finished, the
king and everyone present with him
knelt down and worshiped.
30King Hezekiah and his officials
ordered the Levites to praise the Lord
with the words of David and of Asaph
the seer. So they sang praises with
gladness and bowed their heads and
worshiped.
31Then Hezekiah said, "You have now
dedicated yourselves to the Lord . Come
and bring sacrifices and thank offerings
to the temple of the Lord ." So the
assembly brought sacrifices and thank
offerings, and all whose hearts were
willing brought burnt offerings.
32The number of burnt offerings the
assembly brought was seventy bulls, a
hundred rams and two hundred male
lambs-all of them for burnt offerings to
the Lord .
33The animals consecrated as sacrifices
amounted to six hundred bulls and three
thousand sheep and goats.
34The priests, however, were too few to
skin all the burnt offerings; so their
kinsmen the Levites helped them until
the task was finished and until other
priests had been consecrated, for the
Levites had been more conscientious in
consecrating themselves than the
priests had been.
35There were burnt offerings in
abundance, together with the fat of the
fellowship offerings and the drink
offerings that accompanied the burnt
offerings. So the service of the temple of
the Lord was reestablished.
36Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at
what God had brought about for his
people, because it was done so quickly.
30Hezekiah sent word to all Israel
and Judah and also wrote letters to
Ephraim and Manasseh, inviting them to
come to the temple of the Lord in
Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover
to the Lord , the God of Israel.
2The king and his officials and the whole
assembly in Jerusalem decided to
celebrate the Passover in the second
month.
3They had not been able to celebrate it
at the regular time because not enough
priests had consecrated themselves and
the people had not assembled in
Jerusalem.
4The plan seemed right both to the king
and to the whole assembly.
5They decided to send a proclamation
throughout Israel, from Beersheba to
Dan, calling the people to come to
Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover
to the Lord , the God of Israel. It had not
been celebrated in large numbers
according to what was written.
6At the king's command, couriers went
throughout Israel and Judah with letters
from the king and from his officials,
which read: "People of Israel, return to
the Lord , the God of Abraham, Isaac
and Israel, that he may return to you
who are left, who have escaped from
the hand of the kings of Assyria.
7Do not be like your fathers and brothers,
who were unfaithful to the Lord , the
God of their fathers, so that he made
them an object of horror, as you see.
8Do not be stiff-necked, as your fathers
were; submit to the Lord . Come to the
sanctuary, which he has consecrated
forever. Serve the Lord your God, so
that his fierce anger will turn away from
you.
9If you return to the Lord , then your
brothers and your children will be shown
compassion by their captors and will
come back to this land, for the Lord your
God is gracious and compassionate. He
will not turn his face from you if you
return to him."
10The couriers went from town to town in
Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as
Zebulun, but the people scorned and
ridiculed them.
11Nevertheless, some men of Asher,
Manasseh and Zebulun humbled
themselves and went to Jerusalem.
12Also in Judah the hand of God was on
the people to give them unity of mind to
carry out what the king and his officials
had ordered, following the word of the
Lord .
13A very large crowd of people
assembled in Jerusalem to celebrate the
Feast of Unleavened Bread in the
second month.
14They removed the altars in Jerusalem
and cleared away the incense altars and
threw them into the Kidron Valley.
15They slaughtered the Passover lamb
on the fourteenth day of the second
month. The priests and the Levites were
ashamed and consecrated themselves
and brought burnt offerings to the
temple of the Lord .
16Then they took up their regular
positions as prescribed in the Law of
Moses the man of God. The priests
sprinkled the blood handed to them by
the Levites.
17Since many in the crowd had not
consecrated themselves, the Levites
had to kill the Passover lambs for all
those who were not ceremonially clean
and could not consecrate their lambs to
the Lord .
18Although most of the many people
who came from Ephraim, Manasseh,
Issachar and Zebulun had not purified
themselves, yet they ate the Passover,
contrary to what was written. But
Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, "May
the Lord , who is good, pardon everyone
19who sets his heart on seeking God-the
Lord , the God of his fathers-even if he
is not clean according to the rules of the
sanctuary."
20And the Lord heard Hezekiah and
healed the people.
21The Israelites who were present in
Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of
Unleavened Bread for seven days with
great rejoicing, while the Levites and
priests sang to the Lord every day,
accompanied by the Lord 's instruments
of praise.
22Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all
the Levites, who showed good
understanding of the service of the Lord .
For the seven days they ate their
assigned portion and offered fellowship
offerings and praised the Lord , the God
of their fathers.
23The whole assembly then agreed to
celebrate the festival seven more days;
so for another seven days they
celebrated joyfully.
24Hezekiah king of Judah provided a
thousand bulls and seven thousand
sheep and goats for the assembly, and
the officials provided them with a
thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep
and goats. A great number of priests
consecrated themselves.
25The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced,
along with the priests and Levites and
all who had assembled from Israel,
including the aliens who had come from
Israel and those who lived in Judah.
26There was great joy in Jerusalem, for
since the days of Solomon son of David
king of Israel there had been nothing
like this in Jerusalem.
27The priests and the Levites stood to
bless the people, and God heard them,
for their prayer reached heaven, his holy
dwelling place.
31When all this had ended, the
Israelites who were there went out to the
towns of Judah, smashed the sacred
stones and cut down the Asherah poles.
They destroyed the high places and the
altars throughout Judah and Benjamin
and in Ephraim and Manasseh. After
they had destroyed all of them, the
Israelites returned to their own towns
and to their own property.
2Hezekiah assigned the priests and
Levites to divisions-each of them
according to their duties as priests or
Levites-to offer burnt offerings and
fellowship offerings, to minister, to give
thanks and to sing praises at the gates
of the Lord 's dwelling.
3The king contributed from his own
possessions for the morning and
evening burnt offerings and for the burnt
offerings on the Sabbaths, New Moons
and appointed feasts as written in the
Law of the Lord .
4He ordered the people living in
Jerusalem to give the portion due the
priests and Levites so they could devote
themselves to the Law of the Lord .
5As soon as the order went out, the
Israelites generously gave the firstfruits
of their grain, new wine, oil and honey
and all that the fields produced. They
brought a great amount, a tithe of
everything.
6The men of Israel and Judah who lived
in the towns of Judah also brought a
tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe
of the holy things dedicated to the Lord
their God, and they piled them in heaps.
7They began doing this in the third
month and finished in the seventh
month.
8When Hezekiah and his officials came
and saw the heaps, they praised the
Lord and blessed his people Israel.
9Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites
about the heaps;
10and Azariah the chief priest, from the
family of Zadok, answered, "Since the
people began to bring their contributions
to the temple of the Lord , we have had
enough to eat and plenty to spare,
because the Lord has blessed his
people, and this great amount is left
over."
11Hezekiah gave orders to prepare
storerooms in the temple of the Lord ,
and this was done.
12Then they faithfully brought in the
contributions, tithes and dedicated gifts.
Conaniah, a Levite, was in charge of
these things, and his brother Shimei
was next in rank.
13Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel,
Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah,
Mahath and Benaiah were supervisors
under Conaniah and Shimei his brother,
by appointment of King Hezekiah and
Azariah the official in charge of the
temple of God.
14Kore son of Imnah the Levite, keeper
of the East Gate, was in charge of the
freewill offerings given to God,
distributing the contributions made to
the Lord and also the consecrated gifts.
15Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah,
Amariah and Shecaniah assisted him
faithfully in the towns of the priests,
distributing to their fellow priests
according to their divisions, old and
young alike.
16In addition, they distributed to the
males three years old or more whose
names were in the genealogical
records-all who would enter the temple
of the Lord to perform the daily duties of
their various tasks, according to their
responsibilities and their divisions.
17And they distributed to the priests
enrolled by their families in the
genealogical records and likewise to the
Levites twenty years old or more,
according to their responsibilities and
their divisions.
18They included all the little ones, the
wives, and the sons and daughters of
the whole community listed in these
genealogical records. For they were
faithful in consecrating themselves.
19As for the priests, the descendants of
Aaron, who lived on the farm lands
around their towns or in any other towns,
men were designated by name to
distribute portions to every male among
them and to all who were recorded in
the genealogies of the Levites.
20This is what Hezekiah did throughout
Judah, doing what was good and right
and faithful before the Lord his God.
21In everything that he undertook in the
service of God's temple and in
obedience to the law and the commands,
he sought his God and worked
wholeheartedly. And so he prospered.
32After all that Hezekiah had so
faithfully done, Sennacherib king of
Assyria came and invaded Judah. He
laid siege to the fortified cities, thinking
to conquer them for himself.
2When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib
had come and that he intended to make
war on Jerusalem,
3he consulted with his officials and
military staff about blocking off the water
from the springs outside the city, and
they helped him.
4A large force of men assembled, and
they blocked all the springs and the
stream that flowed through the land.
"Why should the kings of Assyria come
and find plenty of water?" they said.
5Then he worked hard repairing all the
broken sections of the wall and building
towers on it. He built another wall
outside that one and reinforced the
supporting terraces of the City of David.
He also made large numbers of
weapons and shields.
6He appointed military officers over the
people and assembled them before him
in the square at the city gate and
encouraged them with these words:
7"Be strong and courageous. Do not be
afraid or discouraged because of the
king of Assyria and the vast army with
him, for there is a greater power with us
than with him.
8With him is only the arm of flesh, but
with us is the Lord our God to help us
and to fight our battles." And the people
gained confidence from what Hezekiah
the king of Judah said.
9Later, when Sennacherib king of
Assyria and all his forces were laying
siege to Lachish, he sent his officers to
Jerusalem with this message for
Hezekiah king of Judah and for all the
people of Judah who were there:
10"This is what Sennacherib king of
Assyria says: On what are you basing
your confidence, that you remain in
Jerusalem under siege?
11When Hezekiah says, 'The Lord our
God will save us from the hand of the
king of Assyria,' he is misleading you, to
let you die of hunger and thirst.
12Did not Hezekiah himself remove this
god's high places and altars, saying to
Judah and Jerusalem, 'You must
worship before one altar and burn
sacrifices on it'?
13"Do you not know what I and my
fathers have done to all the peoples of
the other lands? Were the gods of those
nations ever able to deliver their land
from my hand?
14Who of all the gods of these nations
that my fathers destroyed has been able
to save his people from me? How then
can your god deliver you from my hand?
15Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you
and mislead you like this. Do not believe
him, for no god of any nation or kingdom
has been able to deliver his people from
my hand or the hand of my fathers. How
much less will your god deliver you from
my hand!"
16Sennacherib's officers spoke further
against the Lord God and against his
servant Hezekiah.
17The king also wrote letters insulting
the Lord , the God of Israel, and saying
this against him: "Just as the gods of the
peoples of the other lands did not
rescue their people from my hand, so
the god of Hezekiah will not rescue his
people from my hand."
18Then they called out in Hebrew to the
people of Jerusalem who were on the
wall, to terrify them and make them
afraid in order to capture the city.
19They spoke about the God of
Jerusalem as they did about the gods of
the other peoples of the world-the work
of men's hands.
20King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah
son of Amoz cried out in prayer to
heaven about this.
21And the Lord sent an angel, who
annihilated all the fighting men and the
leaders and officers in the camp of the
Assyrian king. So he withdrew to his
own land in disgrace. And when he went
into the temple of his god, some of his
sons cut him down with the sword.
22So the Lord saved Hezekiah and the
people of Jerusalem from the hand of
Sennacherib king of Assyria and from
the hand of all others. He took care of
them on every side.
23Many brought offerings to Jerusalem
for the Lord and valuable gifts for
Hezekiah king of Judah. From then on
he was highly regarded by all the
nations.
24In those days Hezekiah became ill and
was at the point of death. He prayed to
the Lord , who answered him and gave
him a miraculous sign.
25But Hezekiah's heart was proud and
he did not respond to the kindness
shown him; therefore the Lord 's wrath
was on him and on Judah and
Jerusalem.
26Then Hezekiah repented of the pride
of his heart, as did the people of
Jerusalem; therefore the Lord 's wrath
did not come upon them during the days
of Hezekiah.
27Hezekiah had very great riches and
honor, and he made treasuries for his
silver and gold and for his precious
stones, spices, shields and all kinds of
valuables.
28He also made buildings to store the
harvest of grain, new wine and oil; and
he made stalls for various kinds of cattle,
and pens for the flocks.
29He built villages and acquired great
numbers of flocks and herds, for God
had given him very great riches.
30It was Hezekiah who blocked the
upper outlet of the Gihon spring and
channeled the water down to the west
side of the City of David. He succeeded
in everything he undertook.
31But when envoys were sent by the
rulers of Babylon to ask him about the
miraculous sign that had occurred in the
land, God left him to test him and to
know everything that was in his heart.
32The other events of Hezekiah's reign
and his acts of devotion are written in
the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of
Amoz in the book of the kings of Judah
and Israel.
33Hezekiah rested with his fathers and
was buried on the hill where the tombs
of David's descendants are. All Judah
and the people of Jerusalem honored
him when he died. And Manasseh his
son succeeded him as king.
33Manasseh was twelve years old
when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem fifty-five years.
2He did evil in the eyes of the Lord ,
following the detestable practices of the
nations the Lord had driven out before
the Israelites.
3He rebuilt the high places his father
Hezekiah had demolished; he also
erected altars to the Baals and made
Asherah poles. He bowed down to all
the starry hosts and worshiped them.
4He built altars in the temple of the Lord ,
of which the Lord had said, "My Name
will remain in Jerusalem forever."
5In both courts of the temple of the Lord ,
he built altars to all the starry hosts.
6He sacrificed his sons in the fire in the
Valley of Ben Hinnom, practiced sorcery,
divination and witchcraft, and consulted
mediums and spiritists. He did much evil
in the eyes of the Lord , provoking him
to anger.
7He took the carved image he had made
and put it in God's temple, of which God
had said to David and to his son
Solomon, "In this temple and in
Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of
all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name
forever.
8I will not again make the feet of the
Israelites leave the land I assigned to
your forefathers, if only they will be
careful to do everything I commanded
them concerning all the laws, decrees
and ordinances given through Moses."
9But Manasseh led Judah and the
people of Jerusalem astray, so that they
did more evil than the nations the Lord
had destroyed before the Israelites.
10The Lord spoke to Manasseh and his
people, but they paid no attention.
11So the Lord brought against them the
army commanders of the king of Assyria,
who took Manasseh prisoner, put a
hook in his nose, bound him with bronze
shackles and took him to Babylon.
12In his distress he sought the favor of
the Lord his God and humbled himself
greatly before the God of his fathers.
13And when he prayed to him, the Lord
was moved by his entreaty and listened
to his plea; so he brought him back to
Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then
Manasseh knew that the Lord is God.
14Afterward he rebuilt the outer wall of
the City of David, west of the Gihon
spring in the valley, as far as the
entrance of the Fish Gate and encircling
the hill of Ophel; he also made it much
higher. He stationed military
commanders in all the fortified cities in
Judah.
15He got rid of the foreign gods and
removed the image from the temple of
the Lord , as well as all the altars he had
built on the temple hill and in Jerusalem;
and he threw them out of the city.
16Then he restored the altar of the Lord
and sacrificed fellowship offerings and
thank offerings on it, and told Judah to
serve the Lord , the God of Israel.
17The people, however, continued to
sacrifice at the high places, but only to
the Lord their God.
18The other events of Manasseh's reign,
including his prayer to his God and the
words the seers spoke to him in the
name of the Lord , the God of Israel, are
written in the annals of the kings of
Israel.
19His prayer and how God was moved
by his entreaty, as well as all his sins
and unfaithfulness, and the sites where
he built high places and set up Asherah
poles and idols before he humbled
himself-all are written in the records of
the seers.
20Manasseh rested with his fathers and
was buried in his palace. And Amon his
son succeeded him as king.
21Amon was twenty-two years old when
he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem two years.
22He did evil in the eyes of the Lord , as
his father Manasseh had done. Amon
worshiped and offered sacrifices to all
the idols Manasseh had made.
23But unlike his father Manasseh, he did
not humble himself before the Lord ;
Amon increased his guilt.
24Amon's officials conspired against him
and assassinated him in his palace.
25Then the people of the land killed all
who had plotted against King Amon, and
they made Josiah his son king in his
place.
34Josiah was eight years old when
he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem thirty-one years.
2He did what was right in the eyes of the
Lord and walked in the ways of his
father David, not turning aside to the
right or to the left.
3In the eighth year of his reign, while he
was still young, he began to seek the
God of his father David. In his twelfth
year he began to purge Judah and
Jerusalem of high places, Asherah
poles, carved idols and cast images.
4Under his direction the altars of the
Baals were torn down; he cut to pieces
the incense altars that were above them,
and smashed the Asherah poles, the
idols and the images. These he broke to
pieces and scattered over the graves of
those who had sacrificed to them.
5He burned the bones of the priests on
their altars, and so he purged Judah and
Jerusalem.
6In the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim and
Simeon, as far as Naphtali, and in the
ruins around them,
7he tore down the altars and the
Asherah poles and crushed the idols to
powder and cut to pieces all the incense
altars throughout Israel. Then he went
back to Jerusalem.
8In the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign,
to purify the land and the temple, he
sent Shaphan son of Azaliah and
Maaseiah the ruler of the city, with Joah
son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair
the temple of the Lord his God.
9They went to Hilkiah the high priest and
gave him the money that had been
brought into the temple of God, which
the Levites who were the doorkeepers
had collected from the people of
Manasseh, Ephraim and the entire
remnant of Israel and from all the people
of Judah and Benjamin and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem.
10Then they entrusted it to the men
appointed to supervise the work on the
Lord 's temple. These men paid the
workers who repaired and restored the
temple.
11They also gave money to the
carpenters and builders to purchase
dressed stone, and timber for joists and
beams for the buildings that the kings of
Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.
12The men did the work faithfully. Over
them to direct them were Jahath and
Obadiah, Levites descended from
Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam,
descended from Kohath. The Levites-all
who were skilled in playing musical
instruments-
13had charge of the laborers and
supervised all the workers from job to
job. Some of the Levites were
secretaries, scribes and doorkeepers.
14While they were bringing out the
money that had been taken into the
temple of the Lord , Hilkiah the priest
found the Book of the Law of the Lord
that had been given through Moses.
15Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary,
"I have found the Book of the Law in the
temple of the Lord ." He gave it to
Shaphan.
16Then Shaphan took the book to the
king and reported to him: "Your officials
are doing everything that has been
committed to them.
17They have paid out the money that
was in the temple of the Lord and have
entrusted it to the supervisors and
workers."
18Then Shaphan the secretary informed
the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given
me a book." And Shaphan read from it
in the presence of the king.
19When the king heard the words of the
Law, he tore his robes.
20He gave these orders to Hilkiah,
Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of
Micah, Shaphan the secretary and
Asaiah the king's attendant:
21"Go and inquire of the Lord for me and
for the remnant in Israel and Judah
about what is written in this book that
has been found. Great is the Lord 's
anger that is poured out on us because
our fathers have not kept the word of the
Lord ; they have not acted in
accordance with all that is written in this
book."
22Hilkiah and those the king had sent
with him went to speak to the
prophetess Huldah, who was the wife of
Shallum son of Tokhath, the son of
Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe. She
lived in Jerusalem, in the Second
District.
23She said to them, "This is what the
Lord , the God of Israel, says: Tell the
man who sent you to me,
24'This is what the Lord says: I am going
to bring disaster on this place and its
people-all the curses written in the book
that has been read in the presence of
the king of Judah.
25Because they have forsaken me and
burned incense to other gods and
provoked me to anger by all that their
hands have made, my anger will be
poured out on this place and will not be
quenched.'
26Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to
inquire of the Lord , 'This is what the
Lord , the God of Israel, says
concerning the words you heard:
27Because your heart was responsive
and you humbled yourself before God
when you heard what he spoke against
this place and its people, and because
you humbled yourself before me and
tore your robes and wept in my
presence, I have heard you, declares
the Lord .
28Now I will gather you to your fathers,
and you will be buried in peace. Your
eyes will not see all the disaster I am
going to bring on this place and on
those who live here.' " So they took her
answer back to the king.
29Then the king called together all the
elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
30He went up to the temple of the Lord
with the men of Judah, the people of
Jerusalem, the priests and the Levitesall
the people from the least to the
greatest. He read in their hearing all the
words of the Book of the Covenant,
which had been found in the temple of
the Lord .
31The king stood by his pillar and
renewed the covenant in the presence
of the Lord -to follow the Lord and keep
his commands, regulations and decrees
with all his heart and all his soul, and to
obey the words of the covenant written
in this book.
32Then he had everyone in Jerusalem
and Benjamin pledge themselves to it;
the people of Jerusalem did this in
accordance with the covenant of God,
the God of their fathers.
33Josiah removed all the detestable idols
from all the territory belonging to the
Israelites, and he had all who were
present in Israel serve the Lord their
God. As long as he lived, they did not
fail to follow the Lord , the God of their
fathers.
35Josiah celebrated the Passover to
the Lord in Jerusalem, and the Passover
lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth
day of the first month.
2He appointed the priests to their duties
and encouraged them in the service of
the Lord 's temple.
3He said to the Levites, who instructed
all Israel and who had been consecrated
to the Lord : "Put the sacred ark in the
temple that Solomon son of David king
of Israel built. It is not to be carried
about on your shoulders. Now serve the
Lord your God and his people Israel.
4Prepare yourselves by families in your
divisions, according to the directions
written by David king of Israel and by his
son Solomon.
5"Stand in the holy place with a group of
Levites for each subdivision of the
families of your fellow countrymen, the
lay people.
6Slaughter the Passover lambs,
consecrate yourselves and prepare the
lambs for your fellow countrymen, doing
what the Lord commanded through
Moses."
7Josiah provided for all the lay people
who were there a total of thirty thousand
sheep and goats for the Passover
offerings, and also three thousand
cattle-all from the king's own
possessions.
8His officials also contributed voluntarily
to the people and the priests and
Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah and Jehiel,
the administrators of God's temple, gave
the priests twenty-six hundred Passover
offerings and three hundred cattle.
9Also Conaniah along with Shemaiah
and Nethanel, his brothers, and
Hashabiah, Jeiel and Jozabad, the
leaders of the Levites, provided five
thousand Passover offerings and five
hundred head of cattle for the Levites.
10The service was arranged and the
priests stood in their places with the
Levites in their divisions as the king had
ordered.
11The Passover lambs were slaughtered,
and the priests sprinkled the blood
handed to them, while the Levites
skinned the animals.
12They set aside the burnt offerings to
give them to the subdivisions of the
families of the people to offer to the
Lord , as is written in the Book of Moses.
They did the same with the cattle.
13They roasted the Passover animals
over the fire as prescribed, and boiled
the holy offerings in pots, caldrons and
pans and served them quickly to all the
people.
14After this, they made preparations for
themselves and for the priests, because
the priests, the descendants of Aaron,
were sacrificing the burnt offerings and
the fat portions until nightfall. So the
Levites made preparations for
themselves and for the Aaronic priests.
15The musicians, the descendants of
Asaph, were in the places prescribed by
David, Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun the
king's seer. The gatekeepers at each
gate did not need to leave their posts,
because their fellow Levites made the
preparations for them.
16So at that time the entire service of the
Lord was carried out for the celebration
of the Passover and the offering of burnt
offerings on the altar of the Lord , as
King Josiah had ordered.
17The Israelites who were present
celebrated the Passover at that time and
observed the Feast of Unleavened
Bread for seven days.
18The Passover had not been observed
like this in Israel since the days of the
prophet Samuel; and none of the kings
of Israel had ever celebrated such a
Passover as did Josiah, with the priests,
the Levites and all Judah and Israel who
were there with the people of Jerusalem.
19This Passover was celebrated in the
eighteenth year of Josiah's reign.
20After all this, when Josiah had set the
temple in order, Neco king of Egypt
went up to fight at Carchemish on the
Euphrates, and Josiah marched out to
meet him in battle.
21But Neco sent messengers to him,
saying, "What quarrel is there between
you and me, O king of Judah? It is not
you I am attacking at this time, but the
house with which I am at war. God has
told me to hurry; so stop opposing God,
who is with me, or he will destroy you."
22Josiah, however, would not turn away
from him, but disguised himself to
engage him in battle. He would not
listen to what Neco had said at God's
command but went to fight him on the
plain of Megiddo.
23Archers shot King Josiah, and he told
his officers, "Take me away; I am badly
wounded."
24So they took him out of his chariot, put
him in the other chariot he had and
brought him to Jerusalem, where he
died. He was buried in the tombs of his
fathers, and all Judah and Jerusalem
mourned for him.
25Jeremiah composed laments for
Josiah, and to this day all the men and
women singers commemorate Josiah in
the laments. These became a tradition
in Israel and are written in the Laments.
26The other events of Josiah's reign and
his acts of devotion, according to what is
written in the Law of the Lord -
27all the events, from beginning to end,
are written in the book of the kings of
Israel and Judah.
36And the people of the land took
Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him
king in Jerusalem in place of his father.
2Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old
when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem three months.
3The king of Egypt dethroned him in
Jerusalem and imposed on Judah a levy
of a hundred talents of silver and a
talent of gold.
4The king of Egypt made Eliakim, a
brother of Jehoahaz, king over Judah
and Jerusalem and changed Eliakim's
name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took
Eliakim's brother Jehoahaz and carried
him off to Egypt.
5Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old
when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem eleven years. He did evil in
the eyes of the Lord his God.
6Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
attacked him and bound him with bronze
shackles to take him to Babylon.
7Nebuchadnezzar also took to Babylon
articles from the temple of the Lord and
put them in his temple there.
8The other events of Jehoiakim's reign,
the detestable things he did and all that
was found against him, are written in the
book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
And Jehoiachin his son succeeded him
as king.
9Jehoiachin was eighteen years old
when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem three months and ten days.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord .
10In the spring, King Nebuchadnezzar
sent for him and brought him to Babylon,
together with articles of value from the
temple of the Lord , and he made
Jehoiachin's uncle, Zedekiah, king over
Judah and Jerusalem.
11Zedekiah was twenty-one years old
when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem eleven years.
12He did evil in the eyes of the Lord his
God and did not humble himself before
Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke the
word of the Lord .
13He also rebelled against King
Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him
take an oath in God's name. He became
stiff-necked and hardened his heart and
would not turn to the Lord , the God of
Israel.
14Furthermore, all the leaders of the
priests and the people became more
and more unfaithful, following all the
detestable practices of the nations and
defiling the temple of the Lord , which he
had consecrated in Jerusalem.
15The Lord , the God of their fathers,
sent word to them through his
messengers again and again, because
he had pity on his people and on his
dwelling place.
16But they mocked God's messengers,
despised his words and scoffed at his
prophets until the wrath of the Lord was
aroused against his people and there
was no remedy.
17He brought up against them the king of
the Babylonians, who killed their young
men with the sword in the sanctuary,
and spared neither young man nor
young woman, old man or aged. God
handed all of them over to
Nebuchadnezzar.
18He carried to Babylon all the articles
from the temple of God, both large and
small, and the treasures of the Lord 's
temple and the treasures of the king and
his officials.
19They set fire to God's temple and
broke down the wall of Jerusalem; they
burned all the palaces and destroyed
everything of value there.
20He carried into exile to Babylon the
remnant, who escaped from the sword,
and they became servants to him and
his sons until the kingdom of Persia
came to power.
21The land enjoyed its sabbath rests; all
the time of its desolation it rested, until
the seventy years were completed in
fulfillment of the word of the Lord
spoken by Jeremiah.
22In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia,
in order to fulfill the word of the Lord
spoken by Jeremiah, the Lord moved
the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to
make a proclamation throughout his
realm and to put it in writing:
23"This is what Cyrus king of Persia
says: " 'The Lord , the God of heaven,
has given me all the kingdoms of the
earth and he has appointed me to build
a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah.
Anyone of his people among you-may
the Lord his God be with him, and let
him go up.' "
Ezra
1In the first year of Cyrus king of
Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the
Lord spoken by Jeremiah, the Lord
moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia
to make a proclamation throughout his
realm and to put it in writing:
2"This is what Cyrus king of Persia says:
" 'The Lord , the God of heaven, has
given me all the kingdoms of the earth
and he has appointed me to build a
temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah.
3Anyone of his people among you-may
his God be with him, and let him go up
to Jerusalem in Judah and build the
temple of the Lord , the God of Israel,
the God who is in Jerusalem.
4And the people of any place where
survivors may now be living are to
provide him with silver and gold, with
goods and livestock, and with freewill
offerings for the temple of God in
Jerusalem.' "
5Then the family heads of Judah and
Benjamin, and the priests and Leviteseveryone
whose heart God had movedprepared
to go up and build the house
of the Lord in Jerusalem.
6All their neighbors assisted them with
articles of silver and gold, with goods
and livestock, and with valuable gifts, in
addition to all the freewill offerings.
7Moreover, King Cyrus brought out the
articles belonging to the temple of the
Lord , which Nebuchadnezzar had
carried away from Jerusalem and had
placed in the temple of his god.
8Cyrus king of Persia had them brought
by Mithredath the treasurer, who
counted them out to Sheshbazzar the
prince of Judah.
9This was the inventory: gold dishes 30
silver dishes 1,000 silver pans 29
10gold bowls 30 matching silver bowls
410 other articles 1,000
11In all, there were 5,400 articles of gold
and of silver. Sheshbazzar brought all
these along when the exiles came up
from Babylon to Jerusalem.
2Now these are the people of the
province who came up from the captivity
of the exiles, whom Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon had taken captive to
Babylon (they returned to Jerusalem
and Judah, each to his own town,
2in company with Zerubbabel, Jeshua,

57Shephatiah, Hattil, Pokereth-

58The temple servants and the
descendants of the servants of Solomon
392
59The following came up from the towns
of Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Kerub, Addon
and Immer, but they could not show that
their families were descended from
Israel:
60The descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah
and Nekoda 652
61And from among the priests: The
descendants of Hobaiah, Hakkoz and
Barzillai (a man who had married a
daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and
was called by that name).
62These searched for their family
records, but they could not find them
and so were excluded from the
priesthood as unclean.
63The governor ordered them not to eat
any of the most sacred food until there
was a priest ministering with the Urim
and Thummim.
64The whole company numbered 42,360,
65besides their 7,337 menservants and
maidservants; and they also had 200
men and women singers.
66They had 736 horses, 245 mules,
67435 camels and 6,720 donkeys.
68When they arrived at the house of the
Lord in Jerusalem, some of the heads of
the families gave freewill offerings
toward the rebuilding of the house of
God on its site.
69According to their ability they gave to
the treasury for this work 61,000
drachmas of gold, 5,000 minas of silver
and 100 priestly garments.
70The priests, the Levites, the singers,
the gatekeepers and the temple
servants settled in their own towns,
along with some of the other people,
and the rest of the Israelites settled in
their towns.
3When the seventh month came and
the Israelites had settled in their towns,
the people assembled as one man in
Jerusalem.
2Then Jeshua son of Jozadak and his
fellow priests and Zerubbabel son of
Shealtiel and his associates began to
build the altar of the God of Israel to
sacrifice burnt offerings on it, in
accordance with what is written in the
Law of Moses the man of God.
3Despite their fear of the peoples around
them, they built the altar on its
foundation and sacrificed burnt offerings
on it to the Lord , both the morning and
evening sacrifices.
4Then in accordance with what is written,
they celebrated the Feast of
Tabernacles with the required number of
burnt offerings prescribed for each day.
5After that, they presented the regular
burnt offerings, the New Moon sacrifices
and the sacrifices for all the appointed
sacred feasts of the Lord , as well as
those brought as freewill offerings to the
Lord .
6On the first day of the seventh month
they began to offer burnt offerings to the
Lord , though the foundation of the Lord
's temple had not yet been laid.
7Then they gave money to the masons
and carpenters, and gave food and drink
and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre,
so that they would bring cedar logs by
sea from Lebanon to Joppa, as
authorized by Cyrus king of Persia.
8In the second month of the second year
after their arrival at the house of God in
Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,
Jeshua son of Jozadak and the rest of
their brothers (the priests and the
Levites and all who had returned from
the captivity to Jerusalem) began the
work, appointing Levites twenty years of
age and older to supervise the building
of the house of the Lord .
9Jeshua and his sons and brothers and
Kadmiel and his sons (descendants of
Hodaviah ) and the sons of Henadad
and their sons and brothers-all Levitesjoined
together in supervising those
working on the house of God.
10When the builders laid the foundation
of the temple of the Lord , the priests in
their vestments and with trumpets, and
the Levites (the sons of Asaph) with
cymbals, took their places to praise the
Lord , as prescribed by David king of
Israel.
11With praise and thanksgiving they
sang to the Lord : "He is good; his love
to Israel endures forever." And all the
people gave a great shout of praise to
the Lord , because the foundation of the
house of the Lord was laid.
12But many of the older priests and
Levites and family heads, who had seen
the former temple, wept aloud when
they saw the foundation of this temple
being laid, while many others shouted
for joy.
13No one could distinguish the sound of
the shouts of joy from the sound of
weeping, because the people made so
much noise. And the sound was heard
far away.
4When the enemies of Judah and
Benjamin heard that the exiles were
building a temple for the Lord , the God
of Israel,
2they came to Zerubbabel and to the
heads of the families and said, "Let us
help you build because, like you, we
seek your God and have been
sacrificing to him since the time of
Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who
brought us here."
3But Zerubbabel, Jeshua and the rest of
the heads of the families of Israel
answered, "You have no part with us in
building a temple to our God. We alone
will build it for the Lord , the God of
Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia,
commanded us."
4Then the peoples around them set out
to discourage the people of Judah and
make them afraid to go on building.
5They hired counselors to work against
them and frustrate their plans during the
entire reign of Cyrus king of Persia and
down to the reign of Darius king of
Persia.
6At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes,
they lodged an accusation against the
people of Judah and Jerusalem.
7And in the days of Artaxerxes king of
Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and
the rest of his associates wrote a letter
to Artaxerxes. The letter was written in
Aramaic script and in the Aramaic
language. ,
8Rehum the commanding officer and
Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter
against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the
king as follows:
9Rehum the commanding officer and
Shimshai the secretary, together with
the rest of their associates-the judges
and officials over the men from Tripolis,
Persia, Erech and Babylon, the Elamites
of Susa,
10and the other people whom the great
and honorable Ashurbanipal deported
and settled in the city of Samaria and
elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates.
11(This is a copy of the letter they sent
him.) To King Artaxerxes, From your
servants, the men of Trans-Euphrates:
12The king should know that the Jews
who came up to us from you have gone
to Jerusalem and are rebuilding that
rebellious and wicked city. They are
restoring the walls and repairing the
foundations.
13Furthermore, the king should know
that if this city is built and its walls are
restored, no more taxes, tribute or duty
will be paid, and the royal revenues will
suffer.
14Now since we are under obligation to
the palace and it is not proper for us to
see the king dishonored, we are sending
this message to inform the king,
15so that a search may be made in the
archives of your predecessors. In these
records you will find that this city is a
rebellious city, troublesome to kings and
provinces, a place of rebellion from
ancient times. That is why this city was
destroyed.
16We inform the king that if this city is
built and its walls are restored, you will
be left with nothing in Trans-Euphrates.
17The king sent this reply: To Rehum the
commanding officer, Shimshai the
secretary and the rest of their
associates living in Samaria and
elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates:
Greetings.
18The letter you sent us has been read
and translated in my presence.
19I issued an order and a search was
made, and it was found that this city has
a long history of revolt against kings and
has been a place of rebellion and
sedition.
20Jerusalem has had powerful kings
ruling over the whole of Trans-
Euphrates, and taxes, tribute and duty
were paid to them.
21Now issue an order to these men to
stop work, so that this city will not be
rebuilt until I so order.
22Be careful not to neglect this matter.
Why let this threat grow, to the detriment
of the royal interests?
23As soon as the copy of the letter of
King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum and
Shimshai the secretary and their
associates, they went immediately to the
Jews in Jerusalem and compelled them
by force to stop.
24Thus the work on the house of God in
Jerusalem came to a standstill until the
second year of the reign of Darius king
of Persia.
5Now Haggai the prophet and
Zechariah the prophet, a descendant of
Iddo, prophesied to the Jews in Judah
and Jerusalem in the name of the God
of Israel, who was over them.
2Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and
Jeshua son of Jozadak set to work to
rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem.
And the prophets of God were with them,
helping them.
3At that time Tattenai, governor of
Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai
and their associates went to them and
asked, "Who authorized you to rebuild
this temple and restore this structure?"
4They also asked, "What are the names
of the men constructing this building?"
5But the eye of their God was watching
over the elders of the Jews, and they
were not stopped until a report could go
to Darius and his written reply be
received.
6This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai,
governor of Trans-Euphrates, and
Shethar-Bozenai and their associates,
the officials of Trans-Euphrates, sent to
King Darius.
7The report they sent him read as
follows: To King Darius: Cordial
greetings.
8The king should know that we went to
the district of Judah, to the temple of the
great God. The people are building it
with large stones and placing the
timbers in the walls. The work is being
carried on with diligence and is making
rapid progress under their direction.
9We questioned the elders and asked
them, "Who authorized you to rebuild
this temple and restore this structure?"
10We also asked them their names, so
that we could write down the names of
their leaders for your information.
11This is the answer they gave us: "We
are the servants of the God of heaven
and earth, and we are rebuilding the
temple that was built many years ago,
one that a great king of Israel built and
finished.
12But because our fathers angered the
God of heaven, he handed them over to
Nebuchadnezzar the Chaldean, king of
Babylon, who destroyed this temple and
deported the people to Babylon.
13"However, in the first year of Cyrus
king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a
decree to rebuild this house of God.
14He even removed from the temple of
Babylon the gold and silver articles of
the house of God, which
Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the
temple in Jerusalem and brought to the
temple in Babylon. "Then King Cyrus
gave them to a man named
Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed
governor,
15and he told him, 'Take these articles
and go and deposit them in the temple
in Jerusalem. And rebuild the house of
God on its site.'
16So this Sheshbazzar came and laid
the foundations of the house of God in
Jerusalem. From that day to the present
it has been under construction but is not
yet finished."
17Now if it pleases the king, let a search
be made in the royal archives of
Babylon to see if King Cyrus did in fact
issue a decree to rebuild this house of
God in Jerusalem. Then let the king
send us his decision in this matter.
6King Darius then issued an order,
and they searched in the archives
stored in the treasury at Babylon.
2A scroll was found in the citadel of
Ecbatana in the province of Media, and
this was written on it: Memorandum:
3In the first year of King Cyrus, the king
issued a decree concerning the temple
of God in Jerusalem: Let the temple be
rebuilt as a place to present sacrifices,
and let its foundations be laid. It is to be
ninety feet high and ninety feet wide,
4with three courses of large stones and
one of timbers. The costs are to be paid
by the royal treasury.
5Also, the gold and silver articles of the
house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar
took from the temple in Jerusalem and
brought to Babylon, are to be returned
to their places in the temple in
Jerusalem; they are to be deposited in
the house of God.
6Now then, Tattenai, governor of Trans-
Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and
you, their fellow officials of that province,
stay away from there.
7Do not interfere with the work on this
temple of God. Let the governor of the
Jews and the Jewish elders rebuild this
house of God on its site.
8Moreover, I hereby decree what you
are to do for these elders of the Jews in
the construction of this house of God:
The expenses of these men are to be
fully paid out of the royal treasury, from
the revenues of Trans-Euphrates, so
that the work will not stop.
9Whatever is needed-young bulls, rams,
male lambs for burnt offerings to the
God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine
and oil, as requested by the priests in
Jerusalem-must be given them daily
without fail,
10so that they may offer sacrifices
pleasing to the God of heaven and pray
for the well-being of the king and his
sons.
11Furthermore, I decree that if anyone
changes this edict, a beam is to be
pulled from his house and he is to be
lifted up and impaled on it. And for this
crime his house is to be made a pile of
rubble.
12May God, who has caused his Name
to dwell there, overthrow any king or
people who lifts a hand to change this
decree or to destroy this temple in
Jerusalem. I Darius have decreed it. Let
it be carried out with diligence.
13Then, because of the decree King
Darius had sent, Tattenai, governor of
Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai
and their associates carried it out with
diligence.
14So the elders of the Jews continued to
build and prosper under the preaching
of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, a
descendant of Iddo. They finished
building the temple according to the
command of the God of Israel and the
decrees of Cyrus, Darius and
Artaxerxes, kings of Persia.
15The temple was completed on the third
day of the month Adar, in the sixth year
of the reign of King Darius.
16Then the people of Israel-the priests,
the Levites and the rest of the exilescelebrated
the dedication of the house
of God with joy.
17For the dedication of this house of God
they offered a hundred bulls, two
hundred rams, four hundred male lambs
and, as a sin offering for all Israel,
twelve male goats, one for each of the
tribes of Israel.
18And they installed the priests in their
divisions and the Levites in their groups
for the service of God at Jerusalem,
according to what is written in the Book
of Moses.
19On the fourteenth day of the first
month, the exiles celebrated the
Passover.
20The priests and Levites had purified
themselves and were all ceremonially
clean. The Levites slaughtered the
Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their
brothers the priests and for themselves.
21So the Israelites who had returned
from the exile ate it, together with all
who had separated themselves from the
unclean practices of their Gentile
neighbors in order to seek the Lord , the
God of Israel.
22For seven days they celebrated with
joy the Feast of Unleavened Bread,
because the Lord had filled them with
joy by changing the attitude of the king
of Assyria, so that he assisted them in
the work on the house of God, the God
of Israel.
7After these things, during the reign of
Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of
Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of
Hilkiah,
2the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok,
the son of Ahitub,
3the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah,
the son of Meraioth,
4the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi,
the son of Bukki,
5the son of Abishua, the son of
Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of
Aaron the chief priest-
6this Ezra came up from Babylon. He
was a teacher well versed in the Law of
Moses, which the Lord , the God of
Israel, had given. The king had granted
him everything he asked, for the hand of
the Lord his God was on him.
7Some of the Israelites, including priests,
Levites, singers, gatekeepers and
temple servants, also came up to
Jerusalem in the seventh year of King
Artaxerxes.
8Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth
month of the seventh year of the king.
9He had begun his journey from Babylon
on the first day of the first month, and he
arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of
the fifth month, for the gracious hand of
his God was on him.
10For Ezra had devoted himself to the
study and observance of the Law of the
Lord , and to teaching its decrees and
laws in Israel.
11This is a copy of the letter King
Artaxerxes had given to Ezra the priest
and teacher, a man learned in matters
concerning the commands and decrees
of the Lord for Israel:
12Artaxerxes, king of kings, To Ezra the
priest, a teacher of the Law of the God
of heaven: Greetings.
13Now I decree that any of the Israelites
in my kingdom, including priests and
Levites, who wish to go to Jerusalem
with you, may go.
14You are sent by the king and his seven
advisers to inquire about Judah and
Jerusalem with regard to the Law of
your God, which is in your hand.
15Moreover, you are to take with you the
silver and gold that the king and his
advisers have freely given to the God of
Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,
16together with all the silver and gold
you may obtain from the province of
Babylon, as well as the freewill offerings
of the people and priests for the temple
of their God in Jerusalem.
17With this money be sure to buy bulls,
rams and male lambs, together with
their grain offerings and drink offerings,
and sacrifice them on the altar of the
temple of your God in Jerusalem.
18You and your brother Jews may then
do whatever seems best with the rest of
the silver and gold, in accordance with
the will of your God.
19Deliver to the God of Jerusalem all the
articles entrusted to you for worship in
the temple of your God.
20And anything else needed for the
temple of your God that you may have
occasion to supply, you may provide
from the royal treasury.
21Now I, King Artaxerxes, order all the
treasurers of Trans-Euphrates to
provide with diligence whatever Ezra the
priest, a teacher of the Law of the God
of heaven, may ask of you-
22up to a hundred talents of silver, a
hundred cors of wheat, a hundred baths
of wine, a hundred baths of olive oil, and
salt without limit.
23Whatever the God of heaven has
prescribed, let it be done with diligence
for the temple of the God of heaven.
Why should there be wrath against the
realm of the king and of his sons?
24You are also to know that you have no
authority to impose taxes, tribute or duty
on any of the priests, Levites, singers,
gatekeepers, temple servants or other
workers at this house of God.
25And you, Ezra, in accordance with the
wisdom of your God, which you possess,
appoint magistrates and judges to
administer justice to all the people of
Trans-Euphrates-all who know the laws
of your God. And you are to teach any
who do not know them.
26Whoever does not obey the law of
your God and the law of the king must
surely be punished by death,
banishment, confiscation of property, or
imprisonment.
27Praise be to the Lord , the God of our
fathers, who has put it into the king's
heart to bring honor to the house of the
Lord in Jerusalem in this way
28and who has extended his good favor
to me before the king and his advisers
and all the king's powerful officials.
Because the hand of the Lord my God
was on me, I took courage and gathered
leading men from Israel to go up with
me.
8These are the family heads and
those registered with them who came up
with me from Babylon during the reign of
King Artaxerxes:
2of the descendants of Phinehas,
Gershom; of the descendants of Ithamar,
Daniel; of the descendants of David,
Hattush
3of the descendants of Shecaniah; of the
descendants of Parosh, Zechariah, and
with him were registered 150 men;
4of the descendants of Pahath-Moab,
Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, and with
him 200 men;
5of the descendants of Zattu, Shecaniah
son of Jahaziel, and with him 300 men;
6of the descendants of Adin, Ebed son
of Jonathan, and with him 50 men;
7of the descendants of Elam, Jeshaiah
son of Athaliah, and with him 70 men;
8of the descendants of Shephatiah,
Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him
80 men;
9of the descendants of Joab, Obadiah
son of Jehiel, and with him 218 men;
10of the descendants of Bani, Shelomith
son of Josiphiah, and with him 160 men;
11of the descendants of Bebai,
Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him 28
men;
12of the descendants of Azgad, Johanan
son of Hakkatan, and with him 110 men;
13of the descendants of Adonikam, the
last ones, whose names were Eliphelet,
Jeuel and Shemaiah, and with them 60
men;
14of the descendants of Bigvai, Uthai
and Zaccur, and with them 70 men.
15I assembled them at the canal that
flows toward Ahava, and we camped
there three days. When I checked
among the people and the priests, I
found no Levites there.
16So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel,
Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan,
Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, who
were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan,
who were men of learning,
17and I sent them to Iddo, the leader in
Casiphia. I told them what to say to Iddo
and his kinsmen, the temple servants in
Casiphia, so that they might bring
attendants to us for the house of our
God.
18Because the gracious hand of our God
was on us, they brought us Sherebiah, a
capable man, from the descendants of
Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel, and
Sherebiah's sons and brothers, 18 men;
19and Hashabiah, together with
Jeshaiah from the descendants of
Merari, and his brothers and nephews,
20 men.
20They also brought 220 of the temple
servants-a body that David and the
officials had established to assist the
Levites. All were registered by name.
21There, by the Ahava Canal, I
proclaimed a fast, so that we might
humble ourselves before our God and
ask him for a safe journey for us and our
children, with all our possessions.
22I was ashamed to ask the king for
soldiers and horsemen to protect us
from enemies on the road, because we
had told the king, "The gracious hand of
our God is on everyone who looks to
him, but his great anger is against all
who forsake him."
23So we fasted and petitioned our God
about this, and he answered our prayer.
24Then I set apart twelve of the leading
priests, together with Sherebiah,
Hashabiah and ten of their brothers,
25and I weighed out to them the offering
of silver and gold and the articles that
the king, his advisers, his officials and
all Israel present there had donated for
the house of our God.
26I weighed out to them 650 talents of
silver, silver articles weighing 100
talents, 100 talents of gold,
2720 bowls of gold valued at 1,000
darics, and two fine articles of polished
bronze, as precious as gold.
28I said to them, "You as well as these
articles are consecrated to the Lord .
The silver and gold are a freewill
offering to the Lord , the God of your
fathers.
29Guard them carefully until you weigh
them out in the chambers of the house
of the Lord in Jerusalem before the
leading priests and the Levites and the
family heads of Israel."
30Then the priests and Levites received
the silver and gold and sacred articles
that had been weighed out to be taken
to the house of our God in Jerusalem.
31On the twelfth day of the first month
we set out from the Ahava Canal to go
to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was
on us, and he protected us from
enemies and bandits along the way.
32So we arrived in Jerusalem, where we
rested three days.
33On the fourth day, in the house of our
God, we weighed out the silver and gold
and the sacred articles into the hands of
Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest.
Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him,
and so were the Levites Jozabad son of
Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.
34Everything was accounted for by
number and weight, and the entire
weight was recorded at that time.
35Then the exiles who had returned from
captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the
God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel,
ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male
lambs and, as a sin offering, twelve
male goats. All this was a burnt offering
to the Lord .
36They also delivered the king's orders
to the royal satraps and to the governors
of Trans-Euphrates, who then gave
assistance to the people and to the
house of God.
9After these things had been done,
the leaders came to me and said, "The
people of Israel, including the priests
and the Levites, have not kept
themselves separate from the
neighboring peoples with their
detestable practices, like those of the
Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites,
Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites,
Egyptians and Amorites.
2They have taken some of their
daughters as wives for themselves and
their sons, and have mingled the holy
race with the peoples around them. And
the leaders and officials have led the
way in this unfaithfulness."
3When I heard this, I tore my tunic and
cloak, pulled hair from my head and
beard and sat down appalled.
4Then everyone who trembled at the
words of the God of Israel gathered
around me because of this
unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat
there appalled until the evening sacrifice.
5Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose
from my self-abasement, with my tunic
and cloak torn, and fell on my knees
with my hands spread out to the Lord
my God
6and prayed: "O my God, I am too
ashamed and disgraced to lift up my
face to you, my God, because our sins
are higher than our heads and our guilt
has reached to the heavens.
7From the days of our forefathers until
now, our guilt has been great. Because
of our sins, we and our kings and our
priests have been subjected to the
sword and captivity, to pillage and
humiliation at the hand of foreign kings,
as it is today.
8"But now, for a brief moment, the Lord
our God has been gracious in leaving us
a remnant and giving us a firm place in
his sanctuary, and so our God gives
light to our eyes and a little relief in our
bondage.
9Though we are slaves, our God has not
deserted us in our bondage. He has
shown us kindness in the sight of the
kings of Persia: He has granted us new
life to rebuild the house of our God and
repair its ruins, and he has given us a
wall of protection in Judah and
Jerusalem.
10"But now, O our God, what can we say
after this? For we have disregarded the
commands
11you gave through your servants the
prophets when you said: 'The land you
are entering to possess is a land
polluted by the corruption of its peoples.
By their detestable practices they have
filled it with their impurity from one end
to the other.
12Therefore, do not give your daughters
in marriage to their sons or take their
daughters for your sons. Do not seek a
treaty of friendship with them at any time,
that you may be strong and eat the good
things of the land and leave it to your
children as an everlasting inheritance.'
13"What has happened to us is a result
of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and
yet, our God, you have punished us less
than our sins have deserved and have
given us a remnant like this.
14Shall we again break your commands
and intermarry with the peoples who
commit such detestable practices?
Would you not be angry enough with us
to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or
survivor?
15O Lord , God of Israel, you are
righteous! We are left this day as a
remnant. Here we are before you in our
guilt, though because of it not one of us
can stand in your presence."
10While Ezra was praying and
confessing, weeping and throwing
himself down before the house of God,
a large crowd of Israelites-men, women
and children-gathered around him. They
too wept bitterly.
2Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, one of
the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra,
"We have been unfaithful to our God by
marrying foreign women from the
peoples around us. But in spite of this,
there is still hope for Israel.
3Now let us make a covenant before our
God to send away all these women and
their children, in accordance with the
counsel of my lord and of those who
fear the commands of our God. Let it be
done according to the Law.
4Rise up; this matter is in your hands.
We will support you, so take courage
and do it."
5So Ezra rose up and put the leading
priests and Levites and all Israel under
oath to do what had been suggested.
And they took the oath.
6Then Ezra withdrew from before the
house of God and went to the room of
Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he
was there, he ate no food and drank no
water, because he continued to mourn
over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.
7A proclamation was then issued
throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all
the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem.
8Anyone who failed to appear within
three days would forfeit all his property,
in accordance with the decision of the
officials and elders, and would himself
be expelled from the assembly of the
exiles.
9Within the three days, all the men of
Judah and Benjamin had gathered in
Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of
the ninth month, all the people were
sitting in the square before the house of
God, greatly distressed by the occasion
and because of the rain.
10Then Ezra the priest stood up and said
to them, "You have been unfaithful; you
have married foreign women, adding to
Israel's guilt.
11Now make confession to the Lord , the
God of your fathers, and do his will.
Separate yourselves from the peoples
around you and from your foreign
wives."
12The whole assembly responded with a
loud voice: "You are right! We must do
as you say.
13But there are many people here and it
is the rainy season; so we cannot stand
outside. Besides, this matter cannot be
taken care of in a day or two, because
we have sinned greatly in this thing.
14Let our officials act for the whole
assembly. Then let everyone in our
towns who has married a foreign woman
come at a set time, along with the elders
and judges of each town, until the fierce
anger of our God in this matter is turned
away from us."
15Only Jonathan son of Asahel and
Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by
Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite,
opposed this.
16So the exiles did as was proposed.
Ezra the priest selected men who were
family heads, one from each family
division, and all of them designated by
name. On the first day of the tenth
month they sat down to investigate the
cases,
17and by the first day of the first month
they finished dealing with all the men
who had married foreign women.
18Among the descendants of the priests,
the following had married foreign
women: From the descendants of
Jeshua son of Jozadak, and his
brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and
Gedaliah.
19(They all gave their hands in pledge to
put away their wives, and for their guilt
they each presented a ram from the
flock as a guilt offering.)
20From the descendants of Immer:
Hanani and Zebadiah.
21From the descendants of Harim:
Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel and
Uzziah.
22From the descendants of Pashhur:
Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel,
Jozabad and Elasah.
23Among the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei,
Kelaiah (that is, Kelita), Pethahiah,
Judah and Eliezer.
24From the singers: Eliashib. From the
gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem and Uri.
25And among the other Israelites: From
the descendants of Parosh: Ramiah,
Izziah, Malkijah, Mijamin, Eleazar,
Malkijah and Benaiah.
26From the descendants of Elam:
Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi,
Jeremoth and Elijah.
27From the descendants of Zattu:
Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth,
Zabad and Aziza.
28From the descendants of Bebai:
Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai and
Athlai.
29From the descendants of Bani:
Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub,
Sheal and Jeremoth.
30From the descendants of Pahath-
Moab: Adna, Kelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah,
Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui and
Manasseh.
31From the descendants of Harim:
Eliezer, Ishijah, Malkijah, Shemaiah,
Shimeon,
32Benjamin, Malluch and Shemariah.
33From the descendants of Hashum:
Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet,
Jeremai, Manasseh and Shimei.
34From the descendants of Bani: Maadai,
Amram, Uel,
35Benaiah, Bedeiah, Keluhi,
36Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
37Mattaniah, Mattenai and Jaasu.
38From the descendants of Binnui:
Shimei,
39Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah,
40Macnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
41Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,
42Shallum, Amariah and Joseph.
43From the descendants of Nebo: Jeiel,
Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel
and Benaiah.
44All these had married foreign women,
and some of them had children by these
wives.
Nehemiah
1The words of Nehemiah son of
Hacaliah: In the month of Kislev in the
twentieth year, while I was in the citadel
of Susa,
2Hanani, one of my brothers, came from
Judah with some other men, and I
questioned them about the Jewish
remnant that survived the exile, and also
about Jerusalem.
3They said to me, "Those who survived
the exile and are back in the province
are in great trouble and disgrace. The
wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and
its gates have been burned with fire."
4When I heard these things, I sat down
and wept. For some days I mourned and
fasted and prayed before the God of
heaven.
5Then I said: "O Lord , God of heaven,
the great and awesome God, who keeps
his covenant of love with those who love
him and obey his commands,
6let your ear be attentive and your eyes
open to hear the prayer your servant is
praying before you day and night for
your servants, the people of Israel. I
confess the sins we Israelites, including
myself and my father's house, have
committed against you.
7We have acted very wickedly toward
you. We have not obeyed the
commands, decrees and laws you gave
your servant Moses.
8"Remember the instruction you gave
your servant Moses, saying, 'If you are
unfaithful, I will scatter you among the
nations,
9but if you return to me and obey my
commands, then even if your exiled
people are at the farthest horizon, I will
gather them from there and bring them
to the place I have chosen as a dwelling
for my Name.'
10"They are your servants and your
people, whom you redeemed by your
great strength and your mighty hand.
11O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the
prayer of this your servant and to the
prayer of your servants who delight in
revering your name. Give your servant
success today by granting him favor in
the presence of this man." I was
cupbearer to the king.
2In the month of Nisan in the twentieth
year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was
brought for him, I took the wine and
gave it to the king. I had not been sad in
his presence before;
2so the king asked me, "Why does your
face look so sad when you are not ill?
This can be nothing but sadness of
heart." I was very much afraid,
3but I said to the king, "May the king live
forever! Why should my face not look
sad when the city where my fathers are
buried lies in ruins, and its gates have
been destroyed by fire?"
4The king said to me, "What is it you
want?" Then I prayed to the God of
heaven,
5and I answered the king, "If it pleases
the king and if your servant has found
favor in his sight, let him send me to the
city in Judah where my fathers are
buried so that I can rebuild it."
6Then the king, with the queen sitting
beside him, asked me, "How long will
your journey take, and when will you get
back?" It pleased the king to send me;
so I set a time.
7I also said to him, "If it pleases the king,
may I have letters to the governors of
Trans-Euphrates, so that they will
provide me safe-conduct until I arrive in
Judah?
8And may I have a letter to Asaph,
keeper of the king's forest, so he will
give me timber to make beams for the
gates of the citadel by the temple and
for the city wall and for the residence I
will occupy?" And because the gracious
hand of my God was upon me, the king
granted my requests.
9So I went to the governors of Trans-
Euphrates and gave them the king's
letters. The king had also sent army
officers and cavalry with me.
10When Sanballat the Horonite and
Tobiah the Ammonite official heard
about this, they were very much
disturbed that someone had come to
promote the welfare of the Israelites.
11I went to Jerusalem, and after staying
there three days
12I set out during the night with a few
men. I had not told anyone what my
God had put in my heart to do for
Jerusalem. There were no mounts with
me except the one I was riding on.
13By night I went out through the Valley
Gate toward the Jackal Well and the
Dung Gate, examining the walls of
Jerusalem, which had been broken
down, and its gates, which had been
destroyed by fire.
14Then I moved on toward the Fountain
Gate and the King's Pool, but there was
not enough room for my mount to get
through;
15so I went up the valley by night,
examining the wall. Finally, I turned
back and reentered through the Valley
Gate.
16The officials did not know where I had
gone or what I was doing, because as
yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the
priests or nobles or officials or any
others who would be doing the work.
17Then I said to them, "You see the
trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins,
and its gates have been burned with fire.
Come, let us rebuild the wall of
Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in
disgrace."
18I also told them about the gracious
hand of my God upon me and what the
king had said to me. They replied, "Let
us start rebuilding." So they began this
good work.
19But when Sanballat the Horonite,
Tobiah the Ammonite official and
Geshem the Arab heard about it, they
mocked and ridiculed us. "What is this
you are doing?" they asked. "Are you
rebelling against the king?"
20I answered them by saying, "The God
of heaven will give us success. We his
servants will start rebuilding, but as for
you, you have no share in Jerusalem or
any claim or historic right to it."
3Eliashib the high priest and his fellow
priests went to work and rebuilt the
Sheep Gate. They dedicated it and set
its doors in place, building as far as the
Tower of the Hundred, which they
dedicated, and as far as the Tower of
Hananel.
2The men of Jericho built the adjoining
section, and Zaccur son of Imri built next
to them.
3The Fish Gate was rebuilt by the sons
of Hassenaah. They laid its beams and
put its doors and bolts and bars in place.
4Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of
Hakkoz, repaired the next section. Next
to him Meshullam son of Berekiah, the
son of Meshezabel, made repairs, and
next to him Zadok son of Baana also
made repairs.
5The next section was repaired by the
men of Tekoa, but their nobles would
not put their shoulders to the work under
their supervisors.
6The Jeshanah Gate was repaired by
Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam
son of Besodeiah. They laid its beams
and put its doors and bolts and bars in
place.
7Next to them, repairs were made by
men from Gibeon and Mizpah-Melatiah
of Gibeon and Jadon of Meronothplaces
under the authority of the
governor of Trans-Euphrates.
8Uzziel son of Harhaiah, one of the
goldsmiths, repaired the next section;
and Hananiah, one of the perfumemakers,
made repairs next to that. They
restored Jerusalem as far as the Broad
Wall.
9Rephaiah son of Hur, ruler of a halfdistrict
of Jerusalem, repaired the next
section.
10Adjoining this, Jedaiah son of
Harumaph made repairs opposite his
house, and Hattush son of Hashabneiah
made repairs next to him.
11Malkijah son of Harim and Hasshub
son of Pahath-Moab repaired another
section and the Tower of the Ovens.
12Shallum son of Hallohesh, ruler of a
half-district of Jerusalem, repaired the
next section with the help of his
daughters.
13The Valley Gate was repaired by
Hanun and the residents of Zanoah.
They rebuilt it and put its doors and
bolts and bars in place. They also
repaired five hundred yards of the wall
as far as the Dung Gate.
14The Dung Gate was repaired by
Malkijah son of Recab, ruler of the
district of Beth Hakkerem. He rebuilt it
and put its doors and bolts and bars in
place.
15The Fountain Gate was repaired by
Shallun son of Col-Hozeh, ruler of the
district of Mizpah. He rebuilt it, roofing it
over and putting its doors and bolts and
bars in place. He also repaired the wall
of the Pool of Siloam, by the King's
Garden, as far as the steps going down
from the City of David.
16Beyond him, Nehemiah son of Azbuk,
ruler of a half-district of Beth Zur, made
repairs up to a point opposite the tombs
of David, as far as the artificial pool and
the House of the Heroes.
17Next to him, the repairs were made by
the Levites under Rehum son of Bani.
Beside him, Hashabiah, ruler of half the
district of Keilah, carried out repairs for
his district.
18Next to him, the repairs were made by
their countrymen under Binnui son of
Henadad, ruler of the other half-district
of Keilah.
19Next to him, Ezer son of Jeshua, ruler
of Mizpah, repaired another section,
from a point facing the ascent to the
armory as far as the angle.
20Next to him, Baruch son of Zabbai
zealously repaired another section, from
the angle to the entrance of the house of
Eliashib the high priest.
21Next to him, Meremoth son of Uriah,
the son of Hakkoz, repaired another
section, from the entrance of Eliashib's
house to the end of it.
22The repairs next to him were made by
the priests from the surrounding region.
23Beyond them, Benjamin and Hasshub
made repairs in front of their house; and
next to them, Azariah son of Maaseiah,
the son of Ananiah, made repairs beside
his house.
24Next to him, Binnui son of Henadad
repaired another section, from Azariah's
house to the angle and the corner,
25and Palal son of Uzai worked opposite
the angle and the tower projecting from
the upper palace near the court of the
guard. Next to him, Pedaiah son of
Parosh
26and the temple servants living on the
hill of Ophel made repairs up to a point
opposite the Water Gate toward the east
and the projecting tower.
27Next to them, the men of Tekoa
repaired another section, from the great
projecting tower to the wall of Ophel.
28Above the Horse Gate, the priests
made repairs, each in front of his own
house.
29Next to them, Zadok son of Immer
made repairs opposite his house. Next
to him, Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, the
guard at the East Gate, made repairs.
30Next to him, Hananiah son of
Shelemiah, and Hanun, the sixth son of
Zalaph, repaired another section. Next
to them, Meshullam son of Berekiah
made repairs opposite his living quarters.
31Next to him, Malkijah, one of the
goldsmiths, made repairs as far as the
house of the temple servants and the
merchants, opposite the Inspection Gate,
and as far as the room above the
corner;
32and between the room above the
corner and the Sheep Gate the
goldsmiths and merchants made repairs.
4When Sanballat heard that we were
rebuilding the wall, he became angry
and was greatly incensed. He ridiculed
the Jews,
2and in the presence of his associates
and the army of Samaria, he said, "What
are those feeble Jews doing? Will they
restore their wall? Will they offer
sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Can
they bring the stones back to life from
those heaps of rubble-burned as they
are?"
3Tobiah the Ammonite, who was at his
side, said, "What they are building-if
even a fox climbed up on it, he would
break down their wall of stones!"
4Hear us, O our God, for we are
despised. Turn their insults back on their
own heads. Give them over as plunder
in a land of captivity.
5Do not cover up their guilt or blot out
their sins from your sight, for they have
thrown insults in the face of the builders.
6So we rebuilt the wall till all of it
reached half its height, for the people
worked with all their heart.
7But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs,
the Ammonites and the men of Ashdod
heard that the repairs to Jerusalem's
walls had gone ahead and that the gaps
were being closed, they were very angry.
8They all plotted together to come and
fight against Jerusalem and stir up
trouble against it.
9But we prayed to our God and posted a
guard day and night to meet this threat.
10Meanwhile, the people in Judah said,
"The strength of the laborers is giving
out, and there is so much rubble that we
cannot rebuild the wall."
11Also our enemies said, "Before they
know it or see us, we will be right there
among them and will kill them and put
an end to the work."
12Then the Jews who lived near them
came and told us ten times over,
"Wherever you turn, they will attack us."
13Therefore I stationed some of the
people behind the lowest points of the
wall at the exposed places, posting
them by families, with their swords,
spears and bows.
14After I looked things over, I stood up
and said to the nobles, the officials and
the rest of the people, "Don't be afraid of
them. Remember the Lord, who is great
and awesome, and fight for your
brothers, your sons and your daughters,
your wives and your homes."
15When our enemies heard that we were
aware of their plot and that God had
frustrated it, we all returned to the wall,
each to his own work.
16From that day on, half of my men did
the work, while the other half were
equipped with spears, shields, bows and
armor. The officers posted themselves
behind all the people of Judah
17who were building the wall. Those who
carried materials did their work with one
hand and held a weapon in the other,
18and each of the builders wore his
sword at his side as he worked. But the
man who sounded the trumpet stayed
with me.
19Then I said to the nobles, the officials
and the rest of the people, "The work is
extensive and spread out, and we are
widely separated from each other along
the wall.
20Wherever you hear the sound of the
trumpet, join us there. Our God will fight
for us!"
21So we continued the work with half the
men holding spears, from the first light
of dawn till the stars came out.
22At that time I also said to the people,
"Have every man and his helper stay
inside Jerusalem at night, so they can
serve us as guards by night and
workmen by day."
23Neither I nor my brothers nor my men
nor the guards with me took off our
clothes; each had his weapon, even
when he went for water.
5Now the men and their wives raised
a great outcry against their Jewish
brothers.
2Some were saying, "We and our sons
and daughters are numerous; in order
for us to eat and stay alive, we must get
grain."
3Others were saying, "We are
mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and
our homes to get grain during the
famine."
4Still others were saying, "We have had
to borrow money to pay the king's tax on
our fields and vineyards.
5Although we are of the same flesh and
blood as our countrymen and though
our sons are as good as theirs, yet we
have to subject our sons and daughters
to slavery. Some of our daughters have
already been enslaved, but we are
powerless, because our fields and our
vineyards belong to others."
6When I heard their outcry and these
charges, I was very angry.
7I pondered them in my mind and then
accused the nobles and officials. I told
them, "You are exacting usury from your
own countrymen!" So I called together a
large meeting to deal with them
8and said: "As far as possible, we have
bought back our Jewish brothers who
were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are
selling your brothers, only for them to be
sold back to us!" They kept quiet,
because they could find nothing to say.
9So I continued, "What you are doing is
not right. Shouldn't you walk in the fear
of our God to avoid the reproach of our
Gentile enemies?
10I and my brothers and my men are
also lending the people money and
grain. But let the exacting of usury stop!
11Give back to them immediately their
fields, vineyards, olive groves and
houses, and also the usury you are
charging them-the hundredth part of the
money, grain, new wine and oil."
12"We will give it back," they said. "And
we will not demand anything more from
them. We will do as you say." Then I
summoned the priests and made the
nobles and officials take an oath to do
what they had promised.
13I also shook out the folds of my robe
and said, "In this way may God shake
out of his house and possessions every
man who does not keep this promise.
So may such a man be shaken out and
emptied!" At this the whole assembly
said, "Amen," and praised the Lord .
And the people did as they had
promised.
14Moreover, from the twentieth year of
King Artaxerxes, when I was appointed
to be their governor in the land of Judah,
until his thirty-second year-twelve yearsneither
I nor my brothers ate the food
allotted to the governor.
15But the earlier governors-those
preceding me-placed a heavy burden on
the people and took forty shekels of
silver from them in addition to food and
wine. Their assistants also lorded it over
the people. But out of reverence for God
I did not act like that.
16Instead, I devoted myself to the work
on this wall. All my men were
assembled there for the work; we did
not acquire any land.
17Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews
and officials ate at my table, as well as
those who came to us from the
surrounding nations.
18Each day one ox, six choice sheep
and some poultry were prepared for me,
and every ten days an abundant supply
of wine of all kinds. In spite of all this, I
never demanded the food allotted to the
governor, because the demands were
heavy on these people.
19Remember me with favor, O my God,
for all I have done for these people.
6When word came to Sanballat,
Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest
of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall
and not a gap was left in it-though up to
that time I had not set the doors in the
gates-
2Sanballat and Geshem sent me this
message: "Come, let us meet together
in one of the villages on the plain of
Ono." But they were scheming to harm
me;
3so I sent messengers to them with this
reply: "I am carrying on a great project
and cannot go down. Why should the
work stop while I leave it and go down to
you?"
4Four times they sent me the same
message, and each time I gave them
the same answer.
5Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his
aide to me with the same message, and
in his hand was an unsealed letter
6in which was written: "It is reported
among the nations-and Geshem says it
is true-that you and the Jews are
plotting to revolt, and therefore you are
building the wall. Moreover, according to
these reports you are about to become
their king
7and have even appointed prophets to
make this proclamation about you in
Jerusalem: 'There is a king in Judah!'
Now this report will get back to the king;
so come, let us confer together."
8I sent him this reply: "Nothing like what
you are saying is happening; you are
just making it up out of your head."
9They were all trying to frighten us,
thinking, "Their hands will get too weak
for the work, and it will not be
completed." But I prayed, "Now
strengthen my hands."
10One day I went to the house of
Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of
Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home.
He said, "Let us meet in the house of
God, inside the temple, and let us close
the temple doors, because men are
coming to kill you-by night they are
coming to kill you."
11But I said, "Should a man like me run
away? Or should one like me go into the
temple to save his life? I will not go!"
12I realized that God had not sent him,
but that he had prophesied against me
because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired
him.
13He had been hired to intimidate me so
that I would commit a sin by doing this,
and then they would give me a bad
name to discredit me.
14Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O
my God, because of what they have
done; remember also the prophetess
Noadiah and the rest of the prophets
who have been trying to intimidate me.
15So the wall was completed on the
twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.
16When all our enemies heard about this,
all the surrounding nations were afraid
and lost their self-confidence, because
they realized that this work had been
done with the help of our God.
17Also, in those days the nobles of
Judah were sending many letters to
Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept
coming to them.
18For many in Judah were under oath to
him, since he was son-in-law to
Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son
Jehohanan had married the daughter of
Meshullam son of Berekiah.
19Moreover, they kept reporting to me
his good deeds and then telling him
what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to
intimidate me.
7After the wall had been rebuilt and I
had set the doors in place, the
gatekeepers and the singers and the
Levites were appointed.
2I put in charge of Jerusalem my brother
Hanani, along with Hananiah the
commander of the citadel, because he
was a man of integrity and feared God
more than most men do.
3I said to them, "The gates of Jerusalem
are not to be opened until the sun is hot.
While the gatekeepers are still on duty,
have them shut the doors and bar them.
Also appoint residents of Jerusalem as
guards, some at their posts and some
near their own houses."
4Now the city was large and spacious,
but there were few people in it, and the
houses had not yet been rebuilt.
5So my God put it into my heart to
assemble the nobles, the officials and
the common people for registration by
families. I found the genealogical record
of those who had been the first to return.
This is what I found written there:
6These are the people of the province
who came up from the captivity of the
exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon had taken captive (they
returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each
to his own town,
7in company with Zerubbabel, Jeshua,
Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah,
Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan,
Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum and Baanah):

60The temple servants and the
descendants of the servants of Solomon
392
61The following came up from the towns
of Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Kerub, Addon
and Immer, but they could not show that
their families were descended from
Israel:
62the descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah
and Nekoda 642
63And from among the priests: the
descendants of Hobaiah, Hakkoz and
Barzillai (a man who had married a
daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and
was called by that name).
64These searched for their family
records, but they could not find them
and so were excluded from the
priesthood as unclean.
65The governor, therefore, ordered them
not to eat any of the most sacred food
until there should be a priest ministering
with the Urim and Thummim.
66The whole company numbered 42,360,
67besides their 7,337 menservants and
maidservants; and they also had 245
men and women singers.
68There were 736 horses, 245 mules,
69435 camels and 6,720 donkeys.
70Some of the heads of the families
contributed to the work. The governor
gave to the treasury 1,000 drachmas of
gold, 50 bowls and 530 garments for
priests.
71Some of the heads of the families
gave to the treasury for the work 20,000
drachmas of gold and 2,200 minas of
silver.
72The total given by the rest of the
people was 20,000 drachmas of gold,
2,000 minas of silver and 67 garments
for priests.
73The priests, the Levites, the
gatekeepers, the singers and the temple
servants, along with certain of the
people and the rest of the Israelites,
settled in their own towns. When the
seventh month came and the Israelites
had settled in their towns,
8all the people assembled as one man
in the square before the Water Gate.
They told Ezra the scribe to bring out
the Book of the Law of Moses, which the
Lord had commanded for Israel.
2So on the first day of the seventh
month Ezra the priest brought the Law
before the assembly, which was made
up of men and women and all who were
able to understand.
3He read it aloud from daybreak till noon
as he faced the square before the Water
Gate in the presence of the men,
women and others who could
understand. And all the people listened
attentively to the Book of the Law.
4Ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden
platform built for the occasion. Beside
him on his right stood Mattithiah, Shema,
Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah and Maaseiah;
and on his left were Pedaiah, Mishael,
Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah,
Zechariah and Meshullam.
5Ezra opened the book. All the people
could see him because he was standing
above them; and as he opened it, the
people all stood up.
6Ezra praised the Lord , the great God;
and all the people lifted their hands and
responded, "Amen! Amen!" Then they
bowed down and worshiped the Lord
with their faces to the ground.
7The Levites-Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah,
Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah,
Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad,
Hanan and Pelaiah-instructed the
people in the Law while the people were
standing there.
8They read from the Book of the Law of
God, making it clear and giving the
meaning so that the people could
understand what was being read.
9Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the
priest and scribe, and the Levites who
were instructing the people said to them
all, "This day is sacred to the Lord your
God. Do not mourn or weep." For all the
people had been weeping as they
listened to the words of the Law.
10Nehemiah said, "Go and enjoy choice
food and sweet drinks, and send some
to those who have nothing prepared.
This day is sacred to our Lord. Do not
grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your
strength."
11The Levites calmed all the people,
saying, "Be still, for this is a sacred day.
Do not grieve."
12Then all the people went away to eat
and drink, to send portions of food and
to celebrate with great joy, because they
now understood the words that had
been made known to them.
13On the second day of the month, the
heads of all the families, along with the
priests and the Levites, gathered around
Ezra the scribe to give attention to the
words of the Law.
14They found written in the Law, which
the Lord had commanded through
Moses, that the Israelites were to live in
booths during the feast of the seventh
month
15and that they should proclaim this
word and spread it throughout their
towns and in Jerusalem: "Go out into the
hill country and bring back branches
from olive and wild olive trees, and from
myrtles, palms and shade trees, to
make booths"-as it is written.
16So the people went out and brought
back branches and built themselves
booths on their own roofs, in their
courtyards, in the courts of the house of
God and in the square by the Water
Gate and the one by the Gate of
Ephraim.
17The whole company that had returned
from exile built booths and lived in them.
From the days of Joshua son of Nun
until that day, the Israelites had not
celebrated it like this. And their joy was
very great.
18Day after day, from the first day to the
last, Ezra read from the Book of the Law
of God. They celebrated the feast for
seven days, and on the eighth day, in
accordance with the regulation, there
was an assembly.
9On the twenty-fourth day of the same
month, the Israelites gathered together,
fasting and wearing sackcloth and
having dust on their heads.
2Those of Israelite descent had
separated themselves from all
foreigners. They stood in their places
and confessed their sins and the
wickedness of their fathers.
3They stood where they were and read
from the Book of the Law of the Lord
their God for a quarter of the day, and
spent another quarter in confession and
in worshiping the Lord their God.
4Standing on the stairs were the Levites-
Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah,
Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and Kenani-who
called with loud voices to the Lord their
God.
5And the Levites-Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani,
Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah,
Shebaniah and Pethahiah-said: "Stand
up and praise the Lord your God, who is
from everlasting to everlasting. "
"Blessed be your glorious name, and
may it be exalted above all blessing and
praise.
6You alone are the Lord . You made the
heavens, even the highest heavens, and
all their starry host, the earth and all that
is on it, the seas and all that is in them.
You give life to everything, and the
multitudes of heaven worship you.
7"You are the Lord God, who chose
Abram and brought him out of Ur of the
Chaldeans and named him Abraham.
8You found his heart faithful to you, and
you made a covenant with him to give to
his descendants the land of the
Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites,
Perizzites, Jebusites and Girgashites.
You have kept your promise because
you are righteous.
9"You saw the suffering of our
forefathers in Egypt; you heard their cry
at the Red Sea.
10You sent miraculous signs and
wonders against Pharaoh, against all his
officials and all the people of his land,
for you knew how arrogantly the
Egyptians treated them. You made a
name for yourself, which remains to this
day.
11You divided the sea before them, so
that they passed through it on dry
ground, but you hurled their pursuers
into the depths, like a stone into mighty
waters.
12By day you led them with a pillar of
cloud, and by night with a pillar of fire to
give them light on the way they were to
take.
13"You came down on Mount Sinai; you
spoke to them from heaven. You gave
them regulations and laws that are just
and right, and decrees and commands
that are good.
14You made known to them your holy
Sabbath and gave them commands,
decrees and laws through your servant
Moses.
15In their hunger you gave them bread
from heaven and in their thirst you
brought them water from the rock; you
told them to go in and take possession
of the land you had sworn with uplifted
hand to give them.
16"But they, our forefathers, became
arrogant and stiff-necked, and did not
obey your commands.
17They refused to listen and failed to
remember the miracles you performed
among them. They became stiff-necked
and in their rebellion appointed a leader
in order to return to their slavery. But
you are a forgiving God, gracious and
compassionate, slow to anger and
abounding in love. Therefore you did not
desert them,
18even when they cast for themselves
an image of a calf and said, 'This is your
god, who brought you up out of Egypt,'
or when they committed awful
blasphemies.
19"Because of your great compassion
you did not abandon them in the desert.
By day the pillar of cloud did not cease
to guide them on their path, nor the pillar
of fire by night to shine on the way they
were to take.
20You gave your good Spirit to instruct
them. You did not withhold your manna
from their mouths, and you gave them
water for their thirst.
21For forty years you sustained them in
the desert; they lacked nothing, their
clothes did not wear out nor did their
feet become swollen.
22"You gave them kingdoms and nations,
allotting to them even the remotest
frontiers. They took over the country of
Sihon king of Heshbon and the country
of Og king of Bashan.
23You made their sons as numerous as
the stars in the sky, and you brought
them into the land that you told their
fathers to enter and possess.
24Their sons went in and took
possession of the land. You subdued
before them the Canaanites, who lived
in the land; you handed the Canaanites
over to them, along with their kings and
the peoples of the land, to deal with
them as they pleased.
25They captured fortified cities and fertile
land; they took possession of houses
filled with all kinds of good things, wells
already dug, vineyards, olive groves and
fruit trees in abundance. They ate to the
full and were well-nourished; they
reveled in your great goodness.
26"But they were disobedient and
rebelled against you; they put your law
behind their backs. They killed your
prophets, who had admonished them in
order to turn them back to you; they
committed awful blasphemies.
27So you handed them over to their
enemies, who oppressed them. But
when they were oppressed they cried
out to you. From heaven you heard
them, and in your great compassion you
gave them deliverers, who rescued
them from the hand of their enemies.
28"But as soon as they were at rest, they
again did what was evil in your sight.
Then you abandoned them to the hand
of their enemies so that they ruled over
them. And when they cried out to you
again, you heard from heaven, and in
your compassion you delivered them
time after time.
29"You warned them to return to your
law, but they became arrogant and
disobeyed your commands. They sinned
against your ordinances, by which a
man will live if he obeys them.
Stubbornly they turned their backs on
you, became stiff-necked and refused to
listen.
30For many years you were patient with
them. By your Spirit you admonished
them through your prophets. Yet they
paid no attention, so you handed them
over to the neighboring peoples.
31But in your great mercy you did not put
an end to them or abandon them, for
you are a gracious and merciful God.
32"Now therefore, O our God, the great,
mighty and awesome God, who keeps
his covenant of love, do not let all this
hardship seem trifling in your eyes-the
hardship that has come upon us, upon
our kings and leaders, upon our priests
and prophets, upon our fathers and all
your people, from the days of the kings
of Assyria until today.
33In all that has happened to us, you
have been just; you have acted faithfully,
while we did wrong.
34Our kings, our leaders, our priests and
our fathers did not follow your law; they
did not pay attention to your commands
or the warnings you gave them.
35Even while they were in their kingdom,
enjoying your great goodness to them in
the spacious and fertile land you gave
them, they did not serve you or turn
from their evil ways.
36"But see, we are slaves today, slaves
in the land you gave our forefathers so
they could eat its fruit and the other
good things it produces.
37Because of our sins, its abundant
harvest goes to the kings you have
placed over us. They rule over our
bodies and our cattle as they please.
We are in great distress.
38"In view of all this, we are making a
binding agreement, putting it in writing,
and our leaders, our Levites and our
priests are affixing their seals to it."
10Those who sealed it were:
Nehemiah the governor, the son of
Hacaliah. Zedekiah,
2Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
3Pashhur, Amariah, Malkijah,
4Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,

13Hodiah, Bani and Beninu.
14The leaders of the people: Parosh,
Pahath-Moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani,
15Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,
16Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,
17Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,
18Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai,
19Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,
20Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,
21Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,
22Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,
23Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub,
24Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek,
25Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
26Ahiah, Hanan, Anan,
27Malluch, Harim and Baanah.
28"The rest of the people-priests, Levites,
gatekeepers, singers, temple servants
and all who separated themselves from
the neighboring peoples for the sake of
the Law of God, together with their
wives and all their sons and daughters
who are able to understand-
29all these now join their brothers the
nobles, and bind themselves with a
curse and an oath to follow the Law of
God given through Moses the servant of
God and to obey carefully all the
commands, regulations and decrees of
the Lord our Lord.
30"We promise not to give our daughters
in marriage to the peoples around us or
take their daughters for our sons.
31"When the neighboring peoples bring
merchandise or grain to sell on the
Sabbath, we will not buy from them on
the Sabbath or on any holy day. Every
seventh year we will forgo working the
land and will cancel all debts.
32"We assume the responsibility for
carrying out the commands to give a
third of a shekel each year for the
service of the house of our God:
33for the bread set out on the table; for
the regular grain offerings and burnt
offerings; for the offerings on the
Sabbaths, New Moon festivals and
appointed feasts; for the holy offerings;
for sin offerings to make atonement for
Israel; and for all the duties of the house
of our God.
34"We-the priests, the Levites and the
people-have cast lots to determine when
each of our families is to bring to the
house of our God at set times each year
a contribution of wood to burn on the
altar of the Lord our God, as it is written
in the Law.
35"We also assume responsibility for
bringing to the house of the Lord each
year the firstfruits of our crops and of
every fruit tree.
36"As it is also written in the Law, we will
bring the firstborn of our sons and of our
cattle, of our herds and of our flocks to
the house of our God, to the priests
ministering there.
37"Moreover, we will bring to the
storerooms of the house of our God, to
the priests, the first of our ground meal,
of our grain offerings, of the fruit of all
our trees and of our new wine and oil.
And we will bring a tithe of our crops to
the Levites, for it is the Levites who
collect the tithes in all the towns where
we work.
38A priest descended from Aaron is to
accompany the Levites when they
receive the tithes, and the Levites are to
bring a tenth of the tithes up to the
house of our God, to the storerooms of
the treasury.
39The people of Israel, including the
Levites, are to bring their contributions
of grain, new wine and oil to the
storerooms where the articles for the
sanctuary are kept and where the
ministering priests, the gatekeepers and
the singers stay. "We will not neglect the
house of our God."
11Now the leaders of the people
settled in Jerusalem, and the rest of the
people cast lots to bring one out of
every ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy
city, while the remaining nine were to
stay in their own towns.
2The people commended all the men
who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.
3These are the provincial leaders who
settled in Jerusalem (now some
Israelites, priests, Levites, temple
servants and descendants of Solomon's
servants lived in the towns of Judah,
each on his own property in the various
towns,
4while other people from both Judah and
Benjamin lived in Jerusalem): From the
descendants of Judah: Athaiah son of
Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of
Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son
of Mahalalel, a descendant of Perez;
5and Maaseiah son of Baruch, the son
of Col-Hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the
son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the
son of Zechariah, a descendant of
Shelah.
6The descendants of Perez who lived in
Jerusalem totaled 468 able men.
7From the descendants of Benjamin:
Sallu son of Meshullam, the son of Joed,
the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah,
the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel,
the son of Jeshaiah,
8and his followers, Gabbai and Sallai-
928 men.
9Joel son of Zicri was their chief officer,
and Judah son of Hassenuah was over
the Second District of the city.
10From the priests: Jedaiah; the son of
Joiarib; Jakin;
11Seraiah son of Hilkiah, the son of
Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of
Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, supervisor
in the house of God,
12and their associates, who carried on
work for the temple-822 men; Adaiah
son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the
son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the
son of Pashhur, the son of Malkijah,
13and his associates, who were heads of
families-242 men; Amashsai son of
Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of
Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,
14and his associates, who were able
men-128. Their chief officer was Zabdiel
son of Haggedolim.
15From the Levites: Shemaiah son of
Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of
Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;
16Shabbethai and Jozabad, two of the
heads of the Levites, who had charge of
the outside work of the house of God;
17Mattaniah son of Mica, the son of
Zabdi, the son of Asaph, the director
who led in thanksgiving and prayer;
Bakbukiah, second among his
associates; and Abda son of Shammua,
the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
18The Levites in the holy city totaled 284.
19The gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon and
their associates, who kept watch at the
gates-172 men.
20The rest of the Israelites, with the
priests and Levites, were in all the towns
of Judah, each on his ancestral property.
21The temple servants lived on the hill of
Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were in
charge of them.
22The chief officer of the Levites in
Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, the
son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah,
the son of Mica. Uzzi was one of
Asaph's descendants, who were the
singers responsible for the service of the
house of God.
23The singers were under the king's
orders, which regulated their daily
activity.
24Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, one of
the descendants of Zerah son of Judah,
was the king's agent in all affairs relating
to the people.
25As for the villages with their fields,
some of the people of Judah lived in
Kiriath Arba and its surrounding
settlements, in Dibon and its settlements,
in Jekabzeel and its villages,
26in Jeshua, in Moladah, in Beth Pelet,
27in Hazar Shual, in Beersheba and its
settlements,
28in Ziklag, in Meconah and its
settlements,
29in En Rimmon, in Zorah, in Jarmuth,
30Zanoah, Adullam and their villages, in
Lachish and its fields, and in Azekah
and its settlements. So they were living
all the way from Beersheba to the Valley
of Hinnom.
31The descendants of the Benjamites
from Geba lived in Micmash, Aija,
Bethel and its settlements,
32in Anathoth, Nob and Ananiah,
33in Hazor, Ramah and Gittaim,
34in Hadid, Zeboim and Neballat,
35in Lod and Ono, and in the Valley of
the Craftsmen.
36Some of the divisions of the Levites of
Judah settled in Benjamin.
12These were the priests and
Levites who returned with Zerubbabel
son of Shealtiel and with Jeshua:
Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
2Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
3Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
4Iddo, Ginnethon, Abijah,
5Mijamin, Moadiah, Bilgah,
6Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,
7Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah and Jedaiah.
These were the leaders of the priests
and their associates in the days of
Jeshua.
8The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui,
Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and also
Mattaniah, who, together with his
associates, was in charge of the songs
of thanksgiving.
9Bakbukiah and Unni, their associates,
stood opposite them in the services.
10Jeshua was the father of Joiakim,
Joiakim the father of Eliashib, Eliashib
the father of Joiada,
11Joiada the father of Jonathan, and
Jonathan the father of Jaddua.
12In the days of Joiakim, these were the
heads of the priestly families: of
Seraiah's family, Meraiah; of Jeremiah's,
Hananiah;
13of Ezra's, Meshullam; of Amariah's,
Jehohanan;
14of Malluch's, Jonathan; of Shecaniah's,
Joseph;
15of Harim's, Adna; of Meremoth's,
Helkai;
16of Iddo's, Zechariah; of Ginnethon's,
Meshullam;
17of Abijah's, Zicri; of Miniamin's and of
Moadiah's, Piltai;
18of Bilgah's, Shammua; of Shemaiah's,
Jehonathan;
19of Joiarib's, Mattenai; of Jedaiah's,
Uzzi;
20of Sallu's, Kallai; of Amok's, Eber;
21of Hilkiah's, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah's,
Nethanel.
22The family heads of the Levites in the
days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan and
Jaddua, as well as those of the priests,
were recorded in the reign of Darius the
Persian.
23The family heads among the
descendants of Levi up to the time of
Johanan son of Eliashib were recorded
in the book of the annals.
24And the leaders of the Levites were
Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of
Kadmiel, and their associates, who
stood opposite them to give praise and
thanksgiving, one section responding to
the other, as prescribed by David the
man of God.
25Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah,
Meshullam, Talmon and Akkub were
gatekeepers who guarded the
storerooms at the gates.
26They served in the days of Joiakim
son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and
in the days of Nehemiah the governor
and of Ezra the priest and scribe.
27At the dedication of the wall of
Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out
from where they lived and were brought
to Jerusalem to celebrate joyfully the
dedication with songs of thanksgiving
and with the music of cymbals, harps
and lyres.
28The singers also were brought
together from the region around
Jerusalem-from the villages of the
Netophathites,
29from Beth Gilgal, and from the area of
Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had
built villages for themselves around
Jerusalem.
30When the priests and Levites had
purified themselves ceremonially, they
purified the people, the gates and the
wall.
31I had the leaders of Judah go up on
top of the wall. I also assigned two large
choirs to give thanks. One was to
proceed on top of the wall to the right,
toward the Dung Gate.
32Hoshaiah and half the leaders of
Judah followed them,
33along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
34Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,
35as well as some priests with trumpets,
and also Zechariah son of Jonathan, the
son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah,
the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur,
the son of Asaph,
36and his associates-Shemaiah, Azarel,
Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah
and Hanani-with musical instruments
prescribed by David the man of God.
Ezra the scribe led the procession.
37At the Fountain Gate they continued
directly up the steps of the City of David
on the ascent to the wall and passed
above the house of David to the Water
Gate on the east.
38The second choir proceeded in the
opposite direction. I followed them on
top of the wall, together with half the
people-past the Tower of the Ovens to
the Broad Wall,
39over the Gate of Ephraim, the
Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the
Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the
Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. At
the Gate of the Guard they stopped.
40The two choirs that gave thanks then
took their places in the house of God; so
did I, together with half the officials,
41as well as the priests-Eliakim,
Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai,
Zechariah and Hananiah with their
trumpets-
42and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah,
Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah,
Elam and Ezer. The choirs sang under
the direction of Jezrahiah.
43And on that day they offered great
sacrifices, rejoicing because God had
given them great joy. The women and
children also rejoiced. The sound of
rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard
far away.
44At that time men were appointed to be
in charge of the storerooms for the
contributions, firstfruits and tithes. From
the fields around the towns they were to
bring into the storerooms the portions
required by the Law for the priests and
the Levites, for Judah was pleased with
the ministering priests and Levites.
45They performed the service of their
God and the service of purification, as
did also the singers and gatekeepers,
according to the commands of David
and his son Solomon.
46For long ago, in the days of David and
Asaph, there had been directors for the
singers and for the songs of praise and
thanksgiving to God.
47So in the days of Zerubbabel and of
Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the
daily portions for the singers and
gatekeepers. They also set aside the
portion for the other Levites, and the
Levites set aside the portion for the
descendants of Aaron.
13On that day the Book of Moses
was read aloud in the hearing of the
people and there it was found written
that no Ammonite or Moabite should
ever be admitted into the assembly of
God,
2because they had not met the Israelites
with food and water but had hired
Balaam to call a curse down on them.
(Our God, however, turned the curse
into a blessing.)
3When the people heard this law, they
excluded from Israel all who were of
foreign descent.
4Before this, Eliashib the priest had
been put in charge of the storerooms of
the house of our God. He was closely
associated with Tobiah,
5and he had provided him with a large
room formerly used to store the grain
offerings and incense and temple
articles, and also the tithes of grain, new
wine and oil prescribed for the Levites,
singers and gatekeepers, as well as the
contributions for the priests.
6But while all this was going on, I was
not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second
year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had
returned to the king. Some time later I
asked his permission
7and came back to Jerusalem. Here I
learned about the evil thing Eliashib had
done in providing Tobiah a room in the
courts of the house of God.
8I was greatly displeased and threw all
Tobiah's household goods out of the
room.
9I gave orders to purify the rooms, and
then I put back into them the equipment
of the house of God, with the grain
offerings and the incense.
10I also learned that the portions
assigned to the Levites had not been
given to them, and that all the Levites
and singers responsible for the service
had gone back to their own fields.
11So I rebuked the officials and asked
them, "Why is the house of God
neglected?" Then I called them together
and stationed them at their posts.
12All Judah brought the tithes of grain,
new wine and oil into the storerooms.
13I put Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the
scribe, and a Levite named Pedaiah in
charge of the storerooms and made
Hanan son of Zaccur, the son of
Mattaniah, their assistant, because
these men were considered trustworthy.
They were made responsible for
distributing the supplies to their brothers.
14Remember me for this, O my God, and
do not blot out what I have so faithfully
done for the house of my God and its
services.
15In those days I saw men in Judah
treading winepresses on the Sabbath
and bringing in grain and loading it on
donkeys, together with wine, grapes,
figs and all other kinds of loads. And
they were bringing all this into
Jerusalem on the Sabbath. Therefore I
warned them against selling food on that
day.
16Men from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem
were bringing in fish and all kinds of
merchandise and selling them in
Jerusalem on the Sabbath to the people
of Judah.
17I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said
to them, "What is this wicked thing you
are doing-desecrating the Sabbath day?
18Didn't your forefathers do the same
things, so that our God brought all this
calamity upon us and upon this city?
Now you are stirring up more wrath
against Israel by desecrating the
Sabbath."
19When evening shadows fell on the
gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath,
I ordered the doors to be shut and not
opened until the Sabbath was over. I
stationed some of my own men at the
gates so that no load could be brought
in on the Sabbath day.
20Once or twice the merchants and
sellers of all kinds of goods spent the
night outside Jerusalem.
21But I warned them and said, "Why do
you spend the night by the wall? If you
do this again, I will lay hands on you."
From that time on they no longer came
on the Sabbath.
22Then I commanded the Levites to
purify themselves and go and guard the
gates in order to keep the Sabbath day
holy. Remember me for this also, O my
God, and show mercy to me according
to your great love.
23Moreover, in those days I saw men of
Judah who had married women from
Ashdod, Ammon and Moab.
24Half of their children spoke the
language of Ashdod or the language of
one of the other peoples, and did not
know how to speak the language of
Judah.
25I rebuked them and called curses
down on them. I beat some of the men
and pulled out their hair. I made them
take an oath in God's name and said:
"You are not to give your daughters in
marriage to their sons, nor are you to
take their daughters in marriage for your
sons or for yourselves.
26Was it not because of marriages like
these that Solomon king of Israel
sinned? Among the many nations there
was no king like him. He was loved by
his God, and God made him king over
all Israel, but even he was led into sin by
foreign women.
27Must we hear now that you too are
doing all this terrible wickedness and
are being unfaithful to our God by
marrying foreign women?"
28One of the sons of Joiada son of
Eliashib the high priest was son-in-law
to Sanballat the Horonite. And I drove
him away from me.
29Remember them, O my God, because
they defiled the priestly office and the
covenant of the priesthood and of the
Levites.
30So I purified the priests and the
Levites of everything foreign, and
assigned them duties, each to his own
task.
31I also made provision for contributions
of wood at designated times, and for the
firstfruits. Remember me with favor, O
my God.
Esther
1This is what happened during the
time of Xerxes, the Xerxes who ruled
over 127 provinces stretching from India
to Cush :
2At that time King Xerxes reigned from
his royal throne in the citadel of Susa,
3and in the third year of his reign he
gave a banquet for all his nobles and
officials. The military leaders of Persia
and Media, the princes, and the nobles
of the provinces were present.
4For a full 180 days he displayed the
vast wealth of his kingdom and the
splendor and glory of his majesty.
5When these days were over, the king
gave a banquet, lasting seven days, in
the enclosed garden of the king's palace,
for all the people from the least to the
greatest, who were in the citadel of
Susa.
6The garden had hangings of white and
blue linen, fastened with cords of white
linen and purple material to silver rings
on marble pillars. There were couches
of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement
of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and
other costly stones.
7Wine was served in goblets of gold,
each one different from the other, and
the royal wine was abundant, in keeping
with the king's liberality.
8By the king's command each guest was
allowed to drink in his own way, for the
king instructed all the wine stewards to
serve each man what he wished.
9Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for
the women in the royal palace of King
Xerxes.
10On the seventh day, when King
Xerxes was in high spirits from wine, he
commanded the seven eunuchs who
served him-Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona,
Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carcas-
11to bring before him Queen Vashti,
wearing her royal crown, in order to
display her beauty to the people and
nobles, for she was lovely to look at.
12But when the attendants delivered the
king's command, Queen Vashti refused
to come. Then the king became furious
and burned with anger.
13Since it was customary for the king to
consult experts in matters of law and
justice, he spoke with the wise men who
understood the times
14and were closest to the king-Carshena,
Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres,
Marsena and Memucan, the seven
nobles of Persia and Media who had
special access to the king and were
highest in the kingdom.
15"According to law, what must be done
to Queen Vashti?" he asked. "She has
not obeyed the command of King
Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to
her."
16Then Memucan replied in the
presence of the king and the nobles,
"Queen Vashti has done wrong, not only
against the king but also against all the
nobles and the peoples of all the
provinces of King Xerxes.
17For the queen's conduct will become
known to all the women, and so they will
despise their husbands and say, 'King
Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be
brought before him, but she would not
come.'
18This very day the Persian and Median
women of the nobility who have heard
about the queen's conduct will respond
to all the king's nobles in the same way.
There will be no end of disrespect and
discord.
19"Therefore, if it pleases the king, let
him issue a royal decree and let it be
written in the laws of Persia and Media,
which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is
never again to enter the presence of
King Xerxes. Also let the king give her
royal position to someone else who is
better than she.
20Then when the king's edict is
proclaimed throughout all his vast realm,
all the women will respect their
husbands, from the least to the
greatest."
21The king and his nobles were pleased
with this advice, so the king did as
Memucan proposed.
22He sent dispatches to all parts of the
kingdom, to each province in its own
script and to each people in its own
language, proclaiming in each people's
tongue that every man should be ruler
over his own household.
2Later when the anger of King Xerxes
had subsided, he remembered Vashti
and what she had done and what he
had decreed about her.
2Then the king's personal attendants
proposed, "Let a search be made for
beautiful young virgins for the king.
3Let the king appoint commissioners in
every province of his realm to bring all
these beautiful girls into the harem at
the citadel of Susa. Let them be placed
under the care of Hegai, the king's
eunuch, who is in charge of the women;
and let beauty treatments be given to
them.
4Then let the girl who pleases the king
be queen instead of Vashti." This advice
appealed to the king, and he followed it.
5Now there was in the citadel of Susa a
Jew of the tribe of Benjamin, named
Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei,
the son of Kish,
6who had been carried into exile from
Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon, among those taken captive
with Jehoiachin king of Judah.
7Mordecai had a cousin named
Hadassah, whom he had brought up
because she had neither father nor
mother. This girl, who was also known
as Esther, was lovely in form and
features, and Mordecai had taken her as
his own daughter when her father and
mother died.
8When the king's order and edict had
been proclaimed, many girls were
brought to the citadel of Susa and put
under the care of Hegai. Esther also
was taken to the king's palace and
entrusted to Hegai, who had charge of
the harem.
9The girl pleased him and won his favor.
Immediately he provided her with her
beauty treatments and special food. He
assigned to her seven maids selected
from the king's palace and moved her
and her maids into the best place in the
harem.
10Esther had not revealed her nationality
and family background, because
Mordecai had forbidden her to do so.
11Every day he walked back and forth
near the courtyard of the harem to find
out how Esther was and what was
happening to her.
12Before a girl's turn came to go in to
King Xerxes, she had to complete
twelve months of beauty treatments
prescribed for the women, six months
with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes
and cosmetics.
13And this is how she would go to the
king: Anything she wanted was given
her to take with her from the harem to
the king's palace.
14In the evening she would go there and
in the morning return to another part of
the harem to the care of Shaashgaz, the
king's eunuch who was in charge of the
concubines. She would not return to the
king unless he was pleased with her and
summoned her by name.
15When the turn came for Esther (the girl
Mordecai had adopted, the daughter of
his uncle Abihail) to go to the king, she
asked for nothing other than what Hegai,
the king's eunuch who was in charge of
the harem, suggested. And Esther won
the favor of everyone who saw her.
16She was taken to King Xerxes in the
royal residence in the tenth month, the
month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of
his reign.
17Now the king was attracted to Esther
more than to any of the other women,
and she won his favor and approval
more than any of the other virgins. So
he set a royal crown on her head and
made her queen instead of Vashti.
18And the king gave a great banquet,
Esther's banquet, for all his nobles and
officials. He proclaimed a holiday
throughout the provinces and distributed
gifts with royal liberality.
19When the virgins were assembled a
second time, Mordecai was sitting at the
king's gate.
20But Esther had kept secret her family
background and nationality just as
Mordecai had told her to do, for she
continued to follow Mordecai's
instructions as she had done when he
was bringing her up.
21During the time Mordecai was sitting at
the king's gate, Bigthana and Teresh,
two of the king's officers who guarded
the doorway, became angry and
conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.
22But Mordecai found out about the plot
and told Queen Esther, who in turn
reported it to the king, giving credit to
Mordecai.
23And when the report was investigated
and found to be true, the two officials
were hanged on a gallows. All this was
recorded in the book of the annals in the
presence of the king.
3After these events, King Xerxes
honored Haman son of Hammedatha,
the Agagite, elevating him and giving
him a seat of honor higher than that of
all the other nobles.
2All the royal officials at the king's gate
knelt down and paid honor to Haman,
for the king had commanded this
concerning him. But Mordecai would not
kneel down or pay him honor.
3Then the royal officials at the king's
gate asked Mordecai, "Why do you
disobey the king's command?"
4Day after day they spoke to him but he
refused to comply. Therefore they told
Haman about it to see whether
Mordecai's behavior would be tolerated,
for he had told them he was a Jew.
5When Haman saw that Mordecai would
not kneel down or pay him honor, he
was enraged.
6Yet having learned who Mordecai's
people were, he scorned the idea of
killing only Mordecai. Instead Haman
looked for a way to destroy all
Mordecai's people, the Jews, throughout
the whole kingdom of Xerxes.
7In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in
the first month, the month of Nisan, they
cast the pur (that is, the lot) in the
presence of Haman to select a day and
month. And the lot fell on the twelfth
month, the month of Adar.
8Then Haman said to King Xerxes,
"There is a certain people dispersed and
scattered among the peoples in all the
provinces of your kingdom whose
customs are different from those of all
other people and who do not obey the
king's laws; it is not in the king's best
interest to tolerate them.
9If it pleases the king, let a decree be
issued to destroy them, and I will put ten
thousand talents of silver into the royal
treasury for the men who carry out this
business."
10So the king took his signet ring from
his finger and gave it to Haman son of
Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of
the Jews.
11"Keep the money," the king said to
Haman, "and do with the people as you
please."
12Then on the thirteenth day of the first
month the royal secretaries were
summoned. They wrote out in the script
of each province and in the language of
each people all Haman's orders to the
king's satraps, the governors of the
various provinces and the nobles of the
various peoples. These were written in
the name of King Xerxes himself and
sealed with his own ring.
13Dispatches were sent by couriers to all
the king's provinces with the order to
destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jewsyoung
and old, women and little
children-on a single day, the thirteenth
day of the twelfth month, the month of
Adar, and to plunder their goods.
14A copy of the text of the edict was to
be issued as law in every province and
made known to the people of every
nationality so they would be ready for
that day.
15Spurred on by the king's command,
the couriers went out, and the edict was
issued in the citadel of Susa. The king
and Haman sat down to drink, but the
city of Susa was bewildered.
4When Mordecai learned of all that
had been done, he tore his clothes, put
on sackcloth and ashes, and went out
into the city, wailing loudly and bitterly.
2But he went only as far as the king's
gate, because no one clothed in
sackcloth was allowed to enter it.
3In every province to which the edict and
order of the king came, there was great
mourning among the Jews, with fasting,
weeping and wailing. Many lay in
sackcloth and ashes.
4When Esther's maids and eunuchs
came and told her about Mordecai, she
was in great distress. She sent clothes
for him to put on instead of his sackcloth,
but he would not accept them.
5Then Esther summoned Hathach, one
of the king's eunuchs assigned to attend
her, and ordered him to find out what
was troubling Mordecai and why.
6So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the
open square of the city in front of the
king's gate.
7Mordecai told him everything that had
happened to him, including the exact
amount of money Haman had promised
to pay into the royal treasury for the
destruction of the Jews.
8He also gave him a copy of the text of
the edict for their annihilation, which had
been published in Susa, to show to
Esther and explain it to her, and he told
him to urge her to go into the king's
presence to beg for mercy and plead
with him for her people.
9Hathach went back and reported to
Esther what Mordecai had said.
10Then she instructed him to say to
Mordecai,
11"All the king's officials and the people
of the royal provinces know that for any
man or woman who approaches the
king in the inner court without being
summoned the king has but one law:
that he be put to death. The only
exception to this is for the king to extend
the gold scepter to him and spare his life.
But thirty days have passed since I was
called to go to the king."
12When Esther's words were reported to
Mordecai,
13he sent back this answer: "Do not think
that because you are in the king's house
you alone of all the Jews will escape.
14For if you remain silent at this time,
relief and deliverance for the Jews will
arise from another place, but you and
your father's family will perish. And who
knows but that you have come to royal
position for such a time as this?"
15Then Esther sent this reply to
Mordecai:
16"Go, gather together all the Jews who
are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat
or drink for three days, night or day. I
and my maids will fast as you do. When
this is done, I will go to the king, even
though it is against the law. And if I
perish, I perish."
17So Mordecai went away and carried
out all of Esther's instructions.
5On the third day Esther put on her
royal robes and stood in the inner court
of the palace, in front of the king's hall.
The king was sitting on his royal throne
in the hall, facing the entrance.
2When he saw Queen Esther standing in
the court, he was pleased with her and
held out to her the gold scepter that was
in his hand. So Esther approached and
touched the tip of the scepter.
3Then the king asked, "What is it, Queen
Esther? What is your request? Even up
to half the kingdom, it will be given you."
4"If it pleases the king," replied Esther,
"let the king, together with Haman, come
today to a banquet I have prepared for
him."
5"Bring Haman at once," the king said,
"so that we may do what Esther asks."
So the king and Haman went to the
banquet Esther had prepared.
6As they were drinking wine, the king
again asked Esther, "Now what is your
petition? It will be given you. And what is
your request? Even up to half the
kingdom, it will be granted."
7Esther replied, "My petition and my
request is this:
8If the king regards me with favor and if
it pleases the king to grant my petition
and fulfill my request, let the king and
Haman come tomorrow to the banquet I
will prepare for them. Then I will answer
the king's question."
9Haman went out that day happy and in
high spirits. But when he saw Mordecai
at the king's gate and observed that he
neither rose nor showed fear in his
presence, he was filled with rage
against Mordecai.
10Nevertheless, Haman restrained
himself and went home. Calling together
his friends and Zeresh, his wife,
11Haman boasted to them about his vast
wealth, his many sons, and all the ways
the king had honored him and how he
had elevated him above the other
nobles and officials.
12"And that's not all," Haman added. "I'm
the only person Queen Esther invited to
accompany the king to the banquet she
gave. And she has invited me along with
the king tomorrow.
13But all this gives me no satisfaction as
long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting
at the king's gate."
14His wife Zeresh and all his friends said
to him, "Have a gallows built, seventyfive
feet high, and ask the king in the
morning to have Mordecai hanged on it.
Then go with the king to the dinner and
be happy." This suggestion delighted
Haman, and he had the gallows built.
6That night the king could not sleep;
so he ordered the book of the chronicles,
the record of his reign, to be brought in
and read to him.
2It was found recorded there that
Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and
Teresh, two of the king's officers who
guarded the doorway, who had
conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.
3"What honor and recognition has
Mordecai received for this?" the king
asked. "Nothing has been done for him,"
his attendants answered.
4The king said, "Who is in the court?"
Now Haman had just entered the outer
court of the palace to speak to the king
about hanging Mordecai on the gallows
he had erected for him.
5His attendants answered, "Haman is
standing in the court." "Bring him in," the
king ordered.
6When Haman entered, the king asked
him, "What should be done for the man
the king delights to honor?" Now Haman
thought to himself, "Who is there that
the king would rather honor than me?"
7So he answered the king, "For the man
the king delights to honor,
8have them bring a royal robe the king
has worn and a horse the king has
ridden, one with a royal crest placed on
its head.
9Then let the robe and horse be
entrusted to one of the king's most noble
princes. Let them robe the man the king
delights to honor, and lead him on the
horse through the city streets,
proclaiming before him, 'This is what is
done for the man the king delights to
honor!' "
10"Go at once," the king commanded
Haman. "Get the robe and the horse
and do just as you have suggested for
Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's
gate. Do not neglect anything you have
recommended."
11So Haman got the robe and the horse.
He robed Mordecai, and led him on
horseback through the city streets,
proclaiming before him, "This is what is
done for the man the king delights to
honor!"
12Afterward Mordecai returned to the
king's gate. But Haman rushed home,
with his head covered in grief,
13and told Zeresh his wife and all his
friends everything that had happened to
him. His advisers and his wife Zeresh
said to him, "Since Mordecai, before
whom your downfall has started, is of
Jewish origin, you cannot stand against
him-you will surely come to ruin!"
14While they were still talking with him,
the king's eunuchs arrived and hurried
Haman away to the banquet Esther had
prepared.
7So the king and Haman went to dine
with Queen Esther,
2and as they were drinking wine on that
second day, the king again asked,
"Queen Esther, what is your petition? It
will be given you. What is your request?
Even up to half the kingdom, it will be
granted."
3Then Queen Esther answered, "If I
have found favor with you, O king, and if
it pleases your majesty, grant me my
life-this is my petition. And spare my
people-this is my request.
4For I and my people have been sold for
destruction and slaughter and
annihilation. If we had merely been sold
as male and female slaves, I would
have kept quiet, because no such
distress would justify disturbing the king.
"
5King Xerxes asked Queen Esther,
"Who is he? Where is the man who has
dared to do such a thing?"
6Esther said, "The adversary and enemy
is this vile Haman." Then Haman was
terrified before the king and queen.
7The king got up in a rage, left his wine
and went out into the palace garden. But
Haman, realizing that the king had
already decided his fate, stayed behind
to beg Queen Esther for his life.
8Just as the king returned from the
palace garden to the banquet hall,
Haman was falling on the couch where
Esther was reclining. The king
exclaimed, "Will he even molest the
queen while she is with me in the
house?" As soon as the word left the
king's mouth, they covered Haman's
face.
9Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs
attending the king, said, "A gallows
seventy-five feet high stands by
Haman's house. He had it made for
Mordecai, who spoke up to help the
king." The king said, "Hang him on it!"
10So they hanged Haman on the gallows
he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the
king's fury subsided.
8That same day King Xerxes gave
Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the
enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came
into the presence of the king, for Esther
had told how he was related to her.
2The king took off his signet ring, which
he had reclaimed from Haman, and
presented it to Mordecai. And Esther
appointed him over Haman's estate.
3Esther again pleaded with the king,
falling at his feet and weeping. She
begged him to put an end to the evil
plan of Haman the Agagite, which he
had devised against the Jews.
4Then the king extended the gold
scepter to Esther and she arose and
stood before him.
5"If it pleases the king," she said, "and if
he regards me with favor and thinks it
the right thing to do, and if he is pleased
with me, let an order be written
overruling the dispatches that Haman
son of Hammedatha, the Agagite,
devised and wrote to destroy the Jews
in all the king's provinces.
6For how can I bear to see disaster fall
on my people? How can I bear to see
the destruction of my family?"
7King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther
and to Mordecai the Jew, "Because
Haman attacked the Jews, I have given
his estate to Esther, and they have
hanged him on the gallows.
8Now write another decree in the king's
name in behalf of the Jews as seems
best to you, and seal it with the king's
signet ring-for no document written in
the king's name and sealed with his ring
can be revoked."
9At once the royal secretaries were
summoned-on the twenty-third day of
the third month, the month of Sivan.
They wrote out all Mordecai's orders to
the Jews, and to the satraps, governors
and nobles of the 127 provinces
stretching from India to Cush. These
orders were written in the script of each
province and the language of each
people and also to the Jews in their own
script and language.
10Mordecai wrote in the name of King
Xerxes, sealed the dispatches with the
king's signet ring, and sent them by
mounted couriers, who rode fast horses
especially bred for the king.
11The king's edict granted the Jews in
every city the right to assemble and
protect themselves; to destroy, kill and
annihilate any armed force of any
nationality or province that might attack
them and their women and children; and
to plunder the property of their enemies.
12The day appointed for the Jews to do
this in all the provinces of King Xerxes
was the thirteenth day of the twelfth
month, the month of Adar.
13A copy of the text of the edict was to
be issued as law in every province and
made known to the people of every
nationality so that the Jews would be
ready on that day to avenge themselves
on their enemies.
14The couriers, riding the royal horses,
raced out, spurred on by the king's
command. And the edict was also
issued in the citadel of Susa.
15Mordecai left the king's presence
wearing royal garments of blue and
white, a large crown of gold and a
purple robe of fine linen. And the city of
Susa held a joyous celebration.
16For the Jews it was a time of
happiness and joy, gladness and honor.
17In every province and in every city,
wherever the edict of the king went,
there was joy and gladness among the
Jews, with feasting and celebrating. And
many people of other nationalities
became Jews because fear of the Jews
had seized them.
9On the thirteenth day of the twelfth
month, the month of Adar, the edict
commanded by the king was to be
carried out. On this day the enemies of
the Jews had hoped to overpower them,
but now the tables were turned and the
Jews got the upper hand over those
who hated them.
2The Jews assembled in their cities in all
the provinces of King Xerxes to attack
those seeking their destruction. No one
could stand against them, because the
people of all the other nationalities were
afraid of them.
3And all the nobles of the provinces, the
satraps, the governors and the king's
administrators helped the Jews,
because fear of Mordecai had seized
them.
4Mordecai was prominent in the palace;
his reputation spread throughout the
provinces, and he became more and
more powerful.
5The Jews struck down all their enemies
with the sword, killing and destroying
them, and they did what they pleased to
those who hated them.
6In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed
and destroyed five hundred men.
7They also killed Parshandatha,
Dalphon, Aspatha,
8Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
9Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha,
10the ten sons of Haman son of
Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews.
But they did not lay their hands on the
plunder.
11The number of those slain in the
citadel of Susa was reported to the king
that same day.
12The king said to Queen Esther, "The
Jews have killed and destroyed five
hundred men and the ten sons of
Haman in the citadel of Susa. What
have they done in the rest of the king's
provinces? Now what is your petition? It
will be given you. What is your request?
It will also be granted."
13"If it pleases the king," Esther
answered, "give the Jews in Susa
permission to carry out this day's edict
tomorrow also, and let Haman's ten
sons be hanged on gallows."
14So the king commanded that this be
done. An edict was issued in Susa, and
they hanged the ten sons of Haman.
15The Jews in Susa came together on
the fourteenth day of the month of Adar,
and they put to death in Susa three
hundred men, but they did not lay their
hands on the plunder.
16Meanwhile, the remainder of the Jews
who were in the king's provinces also
assembled to protect themselves and
get relief from their enemies. They killed
seventy-five thousand of them but did
not lay their hands on the plunder.
17This happened on the thirteenth day of
the month of Adar, and on the
fourteenth they rested and made it a day
of feasting and joy.
18The Jews in Susa, however, had
assembled on the thirteenth and
fourteenth, and then on the fifteenth
they rested and made it a day of
feasting and joy.
19That is why rural Jews-those living in
villages-observe the fourteenth of the
month of Adar as a day of joy and
feasting, a day for giving presents to
each other.
20Mordecai recorded these events, and
he sent letters to all the Jews throughout
the provinces of King Xerxes, near and
far,
21to have them celebrate annually the
fourteenth and fifteenth days of the
month of Adar
22as the time when the Jews got relief
from their enemies, and as the month
when their sorrow was turned into joy
and their mourning into a day of
celebration. He wrote them to observe
the days as days of feasting and joy and
giving presents of food to one another
and gifts to the poor.
23So the Jews agreed to continue the
celebration they had begun, doing what
Mordecai had written to them.
24For Haman son of Hammedatha, the
Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had
plotted against the Jews to destroy them
and had cast the pur (that is, the lot) for
their ruin and destruction.
25But when the plot came to the king's
attention, he issued written orders that
the evil scheme Haman had devised
against the Jews should come back
onto his own head, and that he and his
sons should be hanged on the gallows.
26(Therefore these days were called
Purim, from the word pur .) Because of
everything written in this letter and
because of what they had seen and
what had happened to them,
27the Jews took it upon themselves to
establish the custom that they and their
descendants and all who join them
should without fail observe these two
days every year, in the way prescribed
and at the time appointed.
28These days should be remembered
and observed in every generation by
every family, and in every province and
in every city. And these days of Purim
should never cease to be celebrated by
the Jews, nor should the memory of
them die out among their descendants.
29So Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail,
along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with
full authority to confirm this second letter
concerning Purim.
30And Mordecai sent letters to all the
Jews in the 127 provinces of the
kingdom of Xerxes-words of goodwill
and assurance-
31to establish these days of Purim at
their designated times, as Mordecai the
Jew and Queen Esther had decreed for
them, and as they had established for
themselves and their descendants in
regard to their times of fasting and
lamentation.
32Esther's decree confirmed these
regulations about Purim, and it was
written down in the records.
10King Xerxes imposed tribute
throughout the empire, to its distant
shores.
2And all his acts of power and might,
together with a full account of the
greatness of Mordecai to which the king
had raised him, are they not written in
the book of the annals of the kings of
Media and Persia?
3Mordecai the Jew was second in rank
to King Xerxes, preeminent among the
Jews, and held in high esteem by his
many fellow Jews, because he worked
for the good of his people and spoke up
for the welfare of all the Jews.
Job
1In the land of Uz there lived a man
whose name was Job. This man was
blameless and upright; he feared God
and shunned evil.
2He had seven sons and three
daughters,
3and he owned seven thousand sheep,
three thousand camels, five hundred
yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys,
and had a large number of servants. He
was the greatest man among all the
people of the East.
4His sons used to take turns holding
feasts in their homes, and they would
invite their three sisters to eat and drink
with them.
5When a period of feasting had run its
course, Job would send and have them
purified. Early in the morning he would
sacrifice a burnt offering for each of
them, thinking, "Perhaps my children
have sinned and cursed God in their
hearts." This was Job's regular custom.
6One day the angels came to present
themselves before the Lord , and Satan
also came with them.
7The Lord said to Satan, "Where have
you come from?" Satan answered the
Lord , "From roaming through the earth
and going back and forth in it."
8Then the Lord said to Satan, "Have you
considered my servant Job? There is no
one on earth like him; he is blameless
and upright, a man who fears God and
shuns evil."
9"Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan
replied.
10"Have you not put a hedge around him
and his household and everything he
has? You have blessed the work of his
hands, so that his flocks and herds are
spread throughout the land.
11But stretch out your hand and strike
everything he has, and he will surely
curse you to your face."
12The Lord said to Satan, "Very well,
then, everything he has is in your hands,
but on the man himself do not lay a
finger." Then Satan went out from the
presence of the Lord .
13One day when Job's sons and
daughters were feasting and drinking
wine at the oldest brother's house,
14a messenger came to Job and said,
"The oxen were plowing and the
donkeys were grazing nearby,
15and the Sabeans attacked and carried
them off. They put the servants to the
sword, and I am the only one who has
escaped to tell you!"
16While he was still speaking, another
messenger came and said, "The fire of
God fell from the sky and burned up the
sheep and the servants, and I am the
only one who has escaped to tell you!"
17While he was still speaking, another
messenger came and said, "The
Chaldeans formed three raiding parties
and swept down on your camels and
carried them off. They put the servants
to the sword, and I am the only one who
has escaped to tell you!"
18While he was still speaking, yet
another messenger came and said,
"Your sons and daughters were feasting
and drinking wine at the oldest brother's
house,
19when suddenly a mighty wind swept in
from the desert and struck the four
corners of the house. It collapsed on
them and they are dead, and I am the
only one who has escaped to tell you!"
20At this, Job got up and tore his robe
and shaved his head. Then he fell to the
ground in worship
21and said: "Naked I came from my
mother's womb, and naked I will depart.
The Lord gave and the Lord has taken
away; may the name of the Lord be
praised."
22In all this, Job did not sin by charging
God with wrongdoing.
2On another day the angels came to
present themselves before the Lord ,
and Satan also came with them to
present himself before him.
2And the Lord said to Satan, "Where
have you come from?" Satan answered
the Lord , "From roaming through the
earth and going back and forth in it."
3Then the Lord said to Satan, "Have you
considered my servant Job? There is no
one on earth like him; he is blameless
and upright, a man who fears God and
shuns evil. And he still maintains his
integrity, though you incited me against
him to ruin him without any reason."
4"Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man
will give all he has for his own life.
5But stretch out your hand and strike his
flesh and bones, and he will surely
curse you to your face."
6The Lord said to Satan, "Very well, then,
he is in your hands; but you must spare
his life."
7So Satan went out from the presence of
the Lord and afflicted Job with painful
sores from the soles of his feet to the
top of his head.
8Then Job took a piece of broken pottery
and scraped himself with it as he sat
among the ashes.
9His wife said to him, "Are you still
holding on to your integrity? Curse God
and die!"
10He replied, "You are talking like a
foolish woman. Shall we accept good
from God, and not trouble?" In all this,
Job did not sin in what he said.
11When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the
Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and
Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all
the troubles that had come upon him,
they set out from their homes and met
together by agreement to go and
sympathize with him and comfort him.
12When they saw him from a distance,
they could hardly recognize him; they
began to weep aloud, and they tore their
robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.
13Then they sat on the ground with him
for seven days and seven nights. No
one said a word to him, because they
saw how great his suffering was.
3After this, Job opened his mouth and
cursed the day of his birth.
2He said:
3"May the day of my birth perish, and
the night it was said, 'A boy is born!'
4That day-may it turn to darkness; may
God above not care about it; may no
light shine upon it.
5May darkness and deep shadow claim
it once more; may a cloud settle over it;
may blackness overwhelm its light.
6That night-may thick darkness seize it;
may it not be included among the days
of the year nor be entered in any of the
months.
7May that night be barren; may no shout
of joy be heard in it.
8May those who curse days curse that
day, those who are ready to rouse
Leviathan.
9May its morning stars become dark;
may it wait for daylight in vain and not
see the first rays of dawn,
10for it did not shut the doors of the
womb on me to hide trouble from my
eyes.
11"Why did I not perish at birth, and die
as I came from the womb?
12Why were there knees to receive me
and breasts that I might be nursed?
13For now I would be lying down in
peace; I would be asleep and at rest
14with kings and counselors of the earth,
who built for themselves places now
lying in ruins,
15with rulers who had gold, who filled
their houses with silver.
16Or why was I not hidden in the ground
like a stillborn child, like an infant who
never saw the light of day?
17There the wicked cease from turmoil,
and there the weary are at rest.
18Captives also enjoy their ease; they no
longer hear the slave driver's shout.
19The small and the great are there, and
the slave is freed from his master.
20"Why is light given to those in misery,
and life to the bitter of soul,
21to those who long for death that does
not come, who search for it more than
for hidden treasure,
22who are filled with gladness and
rejoice when they reach the grave?
23Why is life given to a man whose way
is hidden, whom God has hedged in?
24For sighing comes to me instead of
food; my groans pour out like water.
25What I feared has come upon me;
what I dreaded has happened to me.
26I have no peace, no quietness; I have
no rest, but only turmoil."
4Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
2"If someone ventures a word with you,
will you be impatient? But who can keep
from speaking?
3Think how you have instructed many,
how you have strengthened feeble
hands.
4Your words have supported those who
stumbled; you have strengthened
faltering knees.
5But now trouble comes to you, and you
are discouraged; it strikes you, and you
are dismayed.
6Should not your piety be your
confidence and your blameless ways
your hope?
7"Consider now: Who, being innocent,
has ever perished? Where were the
upright ever destroyed?
8As I have observed, those who plow
evil and those who sow trouble reap it.
9At the breath of God they are
destroyed; at the blast of his anger they
perish.
10The lions may roar and growl, yet the
teeth of the great lions are broken.
11The lion perishes for lack of prey, and
the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
12"A word was secretly brought to me,
my ears caught a whisper of it.
13Amid disquieting dreams in the night,
when deep sleep falls on men,
14fear and trembling seized me and
made all my bones shake.
15A spirit glided past my face, and the
hair on my body stood on end.
16It stopped, but I could not tell what it
was. A form stood before my eyes, and I
heard a hushed voice:
17'Can a mortal be more righteous than
God? Can a man be more pure than his
Maker?
18If God places no trust in his servants, if
he charges his angels with error,
19how much more those who live in
houses of clay, whose foundations are
in the dust, who are crushed more
readily than a moth!
20Between dawn and dusk they are
broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish
forever.
21Are not the cords of their tent pulled up,
so that they die without wisdom?'
5"Call if you will, but who will answer
you? To which of the holy ones will you
turn?
2Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays
the simple.
3I myself have seen a fool taking root,
but suddenly his house was cursed.
4His children are far from safety,
crushed in court without a defender.
5The hungry consume his harvest,
taking it even from among thorns, and
the thirsty pant after his wealth.
6For hardship does not spring from the
soil, nor does trouble sprout from the
ground.
7Yet man is born to trouble as surely as
sparks fly upward.
8"But if it were I, I would appeal to God; I
would lay my cause before him.
9He performs wonders that cannot be
fathomed, miracles that cannot be
counted.
10He bestows rain on the earth; he
sends water upon the countryside.
11The lowly he sets on high, and those
who mourn are lifted to safety.
12He thwarts the plans of the crafty, so
that their hands achieve no success.
13He catches the wise in their craftiness,
and the schemes of the wily are swept
away.
14Darkness comes upon them in the
daytime; at noon they grope as in the
night.
15He saves the needy from the sword in
their mouth; he saves them from the
clutches of the powerful.
16So the poor have hope, and injustice
shuts its mouth.
17"Blessed is the man whom God
corrects; so do not despise the
discipline of the Almighty.
18For he wounds, but he also binds up;
he injures, but his hands also heal.
19From six calamities he will rescue you;
in seven no harm will befall you.
20In famine he will ransom you from
death, and in battle from the stroke of
the sword.
21You will be protected from the lash of
the tongue, and need not fear when
destruction comes.
22You will laugh at destruction and
famine, and need not fear the beasts of
the earth.
23For you will have a covenant with the
stones of the field, and the wild animals
will be at peace with you.
24You will know that your tent is secure;
you will take stock of your property and
find nothing missing.
25You will know that your children will be
many, and your descendants like the
grass of the earth.
26You will come to the grave in full vigor,
like sheaves gathered in season.
27"We have examined this, and it is true.
So hear it and apply it to yourself."
6Then Job replied:
2"If only my anguish could be weighed
and all my misery be placed on the
scales!
3It would surely outweigh the sand of the
seas- no wonder my words have been
impetuous.
4The arrows of the Almighty are in me,
my spirit drinks in their poison; God's
terrors are marshaled against me.
5Does a wild donkey bray when it has
grass, or an ox bellow when it has
fodder?
6Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or
is there flavor in the white of an egg ?
7I refuse to touch it; such food makes
me ill.
8"Oh, that I might have my request, that
God would grant what I hope for,
9that God would be willing to crush me,
to let loose his hand and cut me off!
10Then I would still have this
consolation- my joy in unrelenting painthat
I had not denied the words of the
Holy One.
11"What strength do I have, that I should
still hope? What prospects, that I should
be patient?
12Do I have the strength of stone? Is my
flesh bronze?
13Do I have any power to help myself,
now that success has been driven from
me?
14"A despairing man should have the
devotion of his friends, even though he
forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
15But my brothers are as undependable
as intermittent streams, as the streams
that overflow
16when darkened by thawing ice and
swollen with melting snow,
17but that cease to flow in the dry
season, and in the heat vanish from
their channels.
18Caravans turn aside from their routes;
they go up into the wasteland and perish.
19The caravans of Tema look for water,
the traveling merchants of Sheba look in
hope.
20They are distressed, because they had
been confident; they arrive there, only to
be disappointed.
21Now you too have proved to be of no
help; you see something dreadful and
are afraid.
22Have I ever said, 'Give something on
my behalf, pay a ransom for me from
your wealth,
23deliver me from the hand of the enemy,
ransom me from the clutches of the
ruthless'?
24"Teach me, and I will be quiet; show
me where I have been wrong.
25How painful are honest words! But
what do your arguments prove?
26Do you mean to correct what I say,
and treat the words of a despairing man
as wind?
27You would even cast lots for the
fatherless and barter away your friend.
28"But now be so kind as to look at me.
Would I lie to your face?
29Relent, do not be unjust; reconsider,
for my integrity is at stake.
30Is there any wickedness on my lips?
Can my mouth not discern malice?
7"Does not man have hard service on
earth? Are not his days like those of a
hired man?
2Like a slave longing for the evening
shadows, or a hired man waiting eagerly
for his wages,
3so I have been allotted months of futility,
and nights of misery have been
assigned to me.
4When I lie down I think, 'How long
before I get up?' The night drags on,
and I toss till dawn.
5My body is clothed with worms and
scabs, my skin is broken and festering.
6"My days are swifter than a weaver's
shuttle, and they come to an end without
hope.
7Remember, O God, that my life is but a
breath; my eyes will never see
happiness again.
8The eye that now sees me will see me
no longer; you will look for me, but I will
be no more.
9As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he
who goes down to the grave does not
return.
10He will never come to his house again;
his place will know him no more.
11"Therefore I will not keep silent; I will
speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I
will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
12Am I the sea, or the monster of the
deep, that you put me under guard?
13When I think my bed will comfort me
and my couch will ease my complaint,
14even then you frighten me with dreams
and terrify me with visions,
15so that I prefer strangling and death,
rather than this body of mine.
16I despise my life; I would not live
forever. Let me alone; my days have no
meaning.
17"What is man that you make so much
of him, that you give him so much
attention,
18that you examine him every morning
and test him every moment?
19Will you never look away from me, or
let me alone even for an instant?
20If I have sinned, what have I done to
you, O watcher of men? Why have you
made me your target? Have I become a
burden to you?
21Why do you not pardon my offenses
and forgive my sins? For I will soon lie
down in the dust; you will search for me,
but I will be no more."
8Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
2"How long will you say such things?
Your words are a blustering wind.
3Does God pervert justice? Does the
Almighty pervert what is right?
4When your children sinned against him,
he gave them over to the penalty of their
sin.
5But if you will look to God and plead
with the Almighty,
6if you are pure and upright, even now
he will rouse himself on your behalf and
restore you to your rightful place.
7Your beginnings will seem humble, so
prosperous will your future be.
8"Ask the former generations and find
out what their fathers learned,
9for we were born only yesterday and
know nothing, and our days on earth are
but a shadow.
10Will they not instruct you and tell you?
Will they not bring forth words from their
understanding?
11Can papyrus grow tall where there is
no marsh? Can reeds thrive without
water?
12While still growing and uncut, they
wither more quickly than grass.
13Such is the destiny of all who forget
God; so perishes the hope of the
godless.
14What he trusts in is fragile ; what he
relies on is a spider's web.
15He leans on his web, but it gives way;
he clings to it, but it does not hold.
16He is like a well-watered plant in the
sunshine, spreading its shoots over the
garden;
17it entwines its roots around a pile of
rocks and looks for a place among the
stones.
18But when it is torn from its spot, that
place disowns it and says, 'I never saw
you.'
19Surely its life withers away, and from
the soil other plants grow.
20"Surely God does not reject a
blameless man or strengthen the hands
of evildoers.
21He will yet fill your mouth with laughter
and your lips with shouts of joy.
22Your enemies will be clothed in shame,
and the tents of the wicked will be no
more."
9Then Job replied:
2"Indeed, I know that this is true. But
how can a mortal be righteous before
God?
3Though one wished to dispute with him,
he could not answer him one time out of
a thousand.
4His wisdom is profound, his power is
vast. Who has resisted him and come
out unscathed?
5He moves mountains without their
knowing it and overturns them in his
anger.
6He shakes the earth from its place and
makes its pillars tremble.
7He speaks to the sun and it does not
shine; he seals off the light of the stars.
8He alone stretches out the heavens
and treads on the waves of the sea.
9He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion,
the Pleiades and the constellations of
the south.
10He performs wonders that cannot be
fathomed, miracles that cannot be
counted.
11When he passes me, I cannot see
him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive
him.
12If he snatches away, who can stop
him? Who can say to him, 'What are you
doing?'
13God does not restrain his anger; even
the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.
14"How then can I dispute with him?
How can I find words to argue with him?
15Though I were innocent, I could not
answer him; I could only plead with my
Judge for mercy.
16Even if I summoned him and he
responded, I do not believe he would
give me a hearing.
17He would crush me with a storm and
multiply my wounds for no reason.
18He would not let me regain my breath
but would overwhelm me with misery.
19If it is a matter of strength, he is
mighty! And if it is a matter of justice,
who will summon him ?
20Even if I were innocent, my mouth
would condemn me; if I were blameless,
it would pronounce me guilty.
21"Although I am blameless, I have no
concern for myself; I despise my own
life.
22It is all the same; that is why I say, 'He
destroys both the blameless and the
wicked.'
23When a scourge brings sudden death,
he mocks the despair of the innocent.
24When a land falls into the hands of the
wicked, he blindfolds its judges. If it is
not he, then who is it?
25"My days are swifter than a runner;
they fly away without a glimpse of joy.
26They skim past like boats of papyrus,
like eagles swooping down on their prey.
27If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will
change my expression, and smile,'
28I still dread all my sufferings, for I know
you will not hold me innocent.
29Since I am already found guilty, why
should I struggle in vain?
30Even if I washed myself with soap and
my hands with washing soda,
31you would plunge me into a slime pit
so that even my clothes would detest
me.
32"He is not a man like me that I might
answer him, that we might confront each
other in court.
33If only there were someone to arbitrate
between us, to lay his hand upon us
both,
34someone to remove God's rod from
me, so that his terror would frighten me
no more.
35Then I would speak up without fear of
him, but as it now stands with me, I
cannot.
10"I loathe my very life; therefore I
will give free rein to my complaint and
speak out in the bitterness of my soul.
2I will say to God: Do not condemn me,
but tell me what charges you have
against me.
3Does it please you to oppress me, to
spurn the work of your hands, while you
smile on the schemes of the wicked?
4Do you have eyes of flesh? Do you see
as a mortal sees?
5Are your days like those of a mortal or
your years like those of a man,
6that you must search out my faults and
probe after my sin-
7though you know that I am not guilty
and that no one can rescue me from
your hand?
8"Your hands shaped me and made me.
Will you now turn and destroy me?
9Remember that you molded me like
clay. Will you now turn me to dust
again?
10Did you not pour me out like milk and
curdle me like cheese,
11clothe me with skin and flesh and knit
me together with bones and sinews?
12You gave me life and showed me
kindness, and in your providence
watched over my spirit.
13"But this is what you concealed in your
heart, and I know that this was in your
mind:
14If I sinned, you would be watching me
and would not let my offense go
unpunished.
15If I am guilty-woe to me! Even if I am
innocent, I cannot lift my head, for I am
full of shame and drowned in my
affliction.
16If I hold my head high, you stalk me
like a lion and again display your
awesome power against me.
17You bring new witnesses against me
and increase your anger toward me;
your forces come against me wave upon
wave.
18"Why then did you bring me out of the
womb? I wish I had died before any eye
saw me.
19If only I had never come into being, or
had been carried straight from the womb
to the grave!
20Are not my few days almost over?
Turn away from me so I can have a
moment's joy
21before I go to the place of no return, to
the land of gloom and deep shadow,
22to the land of deepest night, of deep
shadow and disorder, where even the
light is like darkness."
11Then Zophar the Naamathite
replied:
2"Are all these words to go
unanswered? Is this talker to be
vindicated?
3Will your idle talk reduce men to
silence? Will no one rebuke you when
you mock?
4You say to God, 'My beliefs are
flawless and I am pure in your sight.'
5Oh, how I wish that God would speak,
that he would open his lips against you
6and disclose to you the secrets of
wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides.
Know this: God has even forgotten
some of your sin.
7"Can you fathom the mysteries of God?
Can you probe the limits of the
Almighty?
8They are higher than the heavens-what
can you do? They are deeper than the
depths of the grave -what can you
know?
9Their measure is longer than the earth
and wider than the sea.
10"If he comes along and confines you in
prison and convenes a court, who can
oppose him?
11Surely he recognizes deceitful men;
and when he sees evil, does he not take
note?
12But a witless man can no more
become wise than a wild donkey's colt
can be born a man.
13"Yet if you devote your heart to him
and stretch out your hands to him,
14if you put away the sin that is in your
hand and allow no evil to dwell in your
tent,
15then you will lift up your face without
shame; you will stand firm and without
fear.
16You will surely forget your trouble,
recalling it only as waters gone by.
17Life will be brighter than noonday, and
darkness will become like morning.
18You will be secure, because there is
hope; you will look about you and take
your rest in safety.
19You will lie down, with no one to make
you afraid, and many will court your
favor.
20But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and
escape will elude them; their hope will
become a dying gasp."
12Then Job replied:
2"Doubtless you are the people, and
wisdom will die with you!
3But I have a mind as well as you; I am
not inferior to you. Who does not know
all these things?
4"I have become a laughingstock to my
friends, though I called upon God and
he answered- a mere laughingstock,
though righteous and blameless!
5Men at ease have contempt for
misfortune as the fate of those whose
feet are slipping.
6The tents of marauders are undisturbed,
and those who provoke God are securethose
who carry their god in their hands.
7"But ask the animals, and they will
teach you, or the birds of the air, and
they will tell you;
8or speak to the earth, and it will teach
you, or let the fish of the sea inform you.
9Which of all these does not know that
the hand of the Lord has done this?
10In his hand is the life of every creature
and the breath of all mankind.
11Does not the ear test words as the
tongue tastes food?
12Is not wisdom found among the aged?
Does not long life bring understanding?
13"To God belong wisdom and power;
counsel and understanding are his.
14What he tears down cannot be rebuilt;
the man he imprisons cannot be
released.
15If he holds back the waters, there is
drought; if he lets them loose, they
devastate the land.
16To him belong strength and victory;
both deceived and deceiver are his.
17He leads counselors away stripped
and makes fools of judges.
18He takes off the shackles put on by
kings and ties a loincloth around their
waist.
19He leads priests away stripped and
overthrows men long established.
20He silences the lips of trusted advisers
and takes away the discernment of
elders.
21He pours contempt on nobles and
disarms the mighty.
22He reveals the deep things of
darkness and brings deep shadows into
the light.
23He makes nations great, and destroys
them; he enlarges nations, and
disperses them.
24He deprives the leaders of the earth of
their reason; he sends them wandering
through a trackless waste.
25They grope in darkness with no light;
he makes them stagger like drunkards.
13"My eyes have seen all this, my
ears have heard and understood it.
2What you know, I also know; I am not
inferior to you.
3But I desire to speak to the Almighty
and to argue my case with God.
4You, however, smear me with lies; you
are worthless physicians, all of you!
5If only you would be altogether silent!
For you, that would be wisdom.
6Hear now my argument; listen to the
plea of my lips.
7Will you speak wickedly on God's
behalf? Will you speak deceitfully for
him?
8Will you show him partiality? Will you
argue the case for God?
9Would it turn out well if he examined
you? Could you deceive him as you
might deceive men?
10He would surely rebuke you if you
secretly showed partiality.
11Would not his splendor terrify you?
Would not the dread of him fall on you?
12Your maxims are proverbs of ashes;
your defenses are defenses of clay.
13"Keep silent and let me speak; then let
come to me what may.
14Why do I put myself in jeopardy and
take my life in my hands?
15Though he slay me, yet will I hope in
him; I will surely defend my ways to his
face.
16Indeed, this will turn out for my
deliverance, for no godless man would
dare come before him!
17Listen carefully to my words; let your
ears take in what I say.
18Now that I have prepared my case, I
know I will be vindicated.
19Can anyone bring charges against
me? If so, I will be silent and die.
20"Only grant me these two things, O
God, and then I will not hide from you:
21Withdraw your hand far from me, and
stop frightening me with your terrors.
22Then summon me and I will answer, or
let me speak, and you reply.
23How many wrongs and sins have I
committed? Show me my offense and
my sin.
24Why do you hide your face and
consider me your enemy?
25Will you torment a windblown leaf?
Will you chase after dry chaff?
26For you write down bitter things
against me and make me inherit the sins
of my youth.
27You fasten my feet in shackles; you
keep close watch on all my paths by
putting marks on the soles of my feet.
28"So man wastes away like something
rotten, like a garment eaten by moths.
14"Man born of woman is of few
days and full of trouble.
2He springs up like a flower and withers
away; like a fleeting shadow, he does
not endure.
3Do you fix your eye on such a one? Will
you bring him before you for judgment?
4Who can bring what is pure from the
impure? No one!
5Man's days are determined; you have
decreed the number of his months and
have set limits he cannot exceed.
6So look away from him and let him
alone, till he has put in his time like a
hired man.
7"At least there is hope for a tree: If it is
cut down, it will sprout again, and its
new shoots will not fail.
8Its roots may grow old in the ground
and its stump die in the soil,
9yet at the scent of water it will bud and
put forth shoots like a plant.
10But man dies and is laid low; he
breathes his last and is no more.
11As water disappears from the sea or a
riverbed becomes parched and dry,
12so man lies down and does not rise; till
the heavens are no more, men will not
awake or be roused from their sleep.
13"If only you would hide me in the grave
and conceal me till your anger has
passed! If only you would set me a time
and then remember me!
14If a man dies, will he live again? All the
days of my hard service I will wait for my
renewal to come.
15You will call and I will answer you; you
will long for the creature your hands
have made.
16Surely then you will count my steps
but not keep track of my sin.
17My offenses will be sealed up in a bag;
you will cover over my sin.
18"But as a mountain erodes and
crumbles and as a rock is moved from
its place,
19as water wears away stones and
torrents wash away the soil, so you
destroy man's hope.
20You overpower him once for all, and
he is gone; you change his countenance
and send him away.
21If his sons are honored, he does not
know it; if they are brought low, he does
not see it.
22He feels but the pain of his own body
and mourns only for himself."
15Then Eliphaz the Temanite
replied:
2"Would a wise man answer with empty
notions or fill his belly with the hot east
wind?
3Would he argue with useless words,
with speeches that have no value?
4But you even undermine piety and
hinder devotion to God.
5Your sin prompts your mouth; you
adopt the tongue of the crafty.
6Your own mouth condemns you, not
mine; your own lips testify against you.
7"Are you the first man ever born? Were
you brought forth before the hills?
8Do you listen in on God's council? Do
you limit wisdom to yourself?
9What do you know that we do not
know? What insights do you have that
we do not have?
10The gray-haired and the aged are on
our side, men even older than your
father.
11Are God's consolations not enough for
you, words spoken gently to you?
12Why has your heart carried you away,
and why do your eyes flash,
13so that you vent your rage against God
and pour out such words from your
mouth?
14"What is man, that he could be pure,
or one born of woman, that he could be
righteous?
15If God places no trust in his holy ones,
if even the heavens are not pure in his
eyes,
16how much less man, who is vile and
corrupt, who drinks up evil like water!
17"Listen to me and I will explain to you;
let me tell you what I have seen,
18what wise men have declared, hiding
nothing received from their fathers
19(to whom alone the land was given
when no alien passed among them):
20All his days the wicked man suffers
torment, the ruthless through all the
years stored up for him.
21Terrifying sounds fill his ears; when all
seems well, marauders attack him.
22He despairs of escaping the darkness;
he is marked for the sword.
23He wanders about-food for vultures ;
he knows the day of darkness is at hand.
24Distress and anguish fill him with
terror; they overwhelm him, like a king
poised to attack,
25because he shakes his fist at God and
vaunts himself against the Almighty,
26defiantly charging against him with a
thick, strong shield.
27"Though his face is covered with fat
and his waist bulges with flesh,
28he will inhabit ruined towns and
houses where no one lives, houses
crumbling to rubble.
29He will no longer be rich and his
wealth will not endure, nor will his
possessions spread over the land.
30He will not escape the darkness; a
flame will wither his shoots, and the
breath of God's mouth will carry him
away.
31Let him not deceive himself by trusting
what is worthless, for he will get nothing
in return.
32Before his time he will be paid in full,
and his branches will not flourish.
33He will be like a vine stripped of its
unripe grapes, like an olive tree
shedding its blossoms.
34For the company of the godless will be
barren, and fire will consume the tents
of those who love bribes.
35They conceive trouble and give birth to
evil; their womb fashions deceit."
16Then Job replied:
2"I have heard many things like these;
miserable comforters are you all!
3Will your long-winded speeches never
end? What ails you that you keep on
arguing?
4I also could speak like you, if you were
in my place; I could make fine speeches
against you and shake my head at you.
5But my mouth would encourage you;
comfort from my lips would bring you
relief.
6"Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved;
and if I refrain, it does not go away.
7Surely, O God, you have worn me out;
you have devastated my entire
household.
8You have bound me-and it has become
a witness; my gauntness rises up and
testifies against me.
9God assails me and tears me in his
anger and gnashes his teeth at me; my
opponent fastens on me his piercing
eyes.
10Men open their mouths to jeer at me;
they strike my cheek in scorn and unite
together against me.
11God has turned me over to evil men
and thrown me into the clutches of the
wicked.
12All was well with me, but he shattered
me; he seized me by the neck and
crushed me. He has made me his
target;
13his archers surround me. Without pity,
he pierces my kidneys and spills my gall
on the ground.
14Again and again he bursts upon me;
he rushes at me like a warrior.
15"I have sewed sackcloth over my skin
and buried my brow in the dust.
16My face is red with weeping, deep
shadows ring my eyes;
17yet my hands have been free of
violence and my prayer is pure.
18"O earth, do not cover my blood; may
my cry never be laid to rest!
19Even now my witness is in heaven; my
advocate is on high.
20My intercessor is my friend as my eyes
pour out tears to God;
21on behalf of a man he pleads with God
as a man pleads for his friend.
22"Only a few years will pass before I go
on the journey of no return.
17My spirit is broken, my days are
cut short, the grave awaits me.
2Surely mockers surround me; my eyes
must dwell on their hostility.
3"Give me, O God, the pledge you
demand. Who else will put up security
for me?
4You have closed their minds to
understanding; therefore you will not let
them triumph.
5If a man denounces his friends for
reward, the eyes of his children will fail.
6"God has made me a byword to
everyone, a man in whose face people
spit.
7My eyes have grown dim with grief; my
whole frame is but a shadow.
8Upright men are appalled at this; the
innocent are aroused against the
ungodly.
9Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to
their ways, and those with clean hands
will grow stronger.
10"But come on, all of you, try again! I
will not find a wise man among you.
11My days have passed, my plans are
shattered, and so are the desires of my
heart.
12These men turn night into day; in the
face of darkness they say, 'Light is
near.'
13If the only home I hope for is the grave,
if I spread out my bed in darkness,
14if I say to corruption, 'You are my
father,' and to the worm, 'My mother' or
'My sister,'
15where then is my hope? Who can see
any hope for me?
16Will it go down to the gates of death ?
Will we descend together into the dust?"
18Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
2"When will you end these speeches?
Be sensible, and then we can talk.
3Why are we regarded as cattle and
considered stupid in your sight?
4You who tear yourself to pieces in your
anger, is the earth to be abandoned for
your sake? Or must the rocks be moved
from their place?
5"The lamp of the wicked is snuffed out;
the flame of his fire stops burning.
6The light in his tent becomes dark; the
lamp beside him goes out.
7The vigor of his step is weakened; his
own schemes throw him down.
8His feet thrust him into a net and he
wanders into its mesh.
9A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare
holds him fast.
10A noose is hidden for him on the
ground; a trap lies in his path.
11Terrors startle him on every side and
dog his every step.
12Calamity is hungry for him; disaster is
ready for him when he falls.
13It eats away parts of his skin; death's
firstborn devours his limbs.
14He is torn from the security of his tent
and marched off to the king of terrors.
15Fire resides in his tent; burning sulfur
is scattered over his dwelling.
16His roots dry up below and his
branches wither above.
17The memory of him perishes from the
earth; he has no name in the land.
18He is driven from light into darkness
and is banished from the world.
19He has no offspring or descendants
among his people, no survivor where
once he lived.
20Men of the west are appalled at his
fate; men of the east are seized with
horror.
21Surely such is the dwelling of an evil
man; such is the place of one who
knows not God."
19Then Job replied:
2"How long will you torment me and
crush me with words?
3Ten times now you have reproached
me; shamelessly you attack me.
4If it is true that I have gone astray, my
error remains my concern alone.
5If indeed you would exalt yourselves
above me and use my humiliation
against me,
6then know that God has wronged me
and drawn his net around me.
7"Though I cry, 'I've been wronged!' I get
no response; though I call for help, there
is no justice.
8He has blocked my way so I cannot
pass; he has shrouded my paths in
darkness.
9He has stripped me of my honor and
removed the crown from my head.
10He tears me down on every side till I
am gone; he uproots my hope like a tree.
11His anger burns against me; he counts
me among his enemies.
12His troops advance in force; they build
a siege ramp against me and encamp
around my tent.
13"He has alienated my brothers from
me; my acquaintances are completely
estranged from me.
14My kinsmen have gone away; my
friends have forgotten me.
15My guests and my maidservants count
me a stranger; they look upon me as an
alien.
16I summon my servant, but he does not
answer, though I beg him with my own
mouth.
17My breath is offensive to my wife; I am
loathsome to my own brothers.
18Even the little boys scorn me; when I
appear, they ridicule me.
19All my intimate friends detest me;
those I love have turned against me.
20I am nothing but skin and bones; I
have escaped with only the skin of my
teeth.
21"Have pity on me, my friends, have
pity, for the hand of God has struck me.
22Why do you pursue me as God does?
Will you never get enough of my flesh?
23"Oh, that my words were recorded,
that they were written on a scroll,
24that they were inscribed with an iron
tool on lead, or engraved in rock forever!
25I know that my Redeemer lives, and
that in the end he will stand upon the
earth.
26And after my skin has been destroyed,
yet in my flesh I will see God;
27I myself will see him with my own
eyes-I, and not another. How my heart
yearns within me!
28"If you say, 'How we will hound him,
since the root of the trouble lies in him, '
29you should fear the sword yourselves;
for wrath will bring punishment by the
sword, and then you will know that there
is judgment. "
20Then Zophar the Naamathite
replied:
2"My troubled thoughts prompt me to
answer because I am greatly disturbed.
3I hear a rebuke that dishonors me, and
my understanding inspires me to reply.
4"Surely you know how it has been from
of old, ever since man was placed on
the earth,
5that the mirth of the wicked is brief, the
joy of the godless lasts but a moment.
6Though his pride reaches to the
heavens and his head touches the
clouds,
7he will perish forever, like his own
dung; those who have seen him will say,
'Where is he?'
8Like a dream he flies away, no more to
be found, banished like a vision of the
night.
9The eye that saw him will not see him
again; his place will look on him no more.
10His children must make amends to the
poor; his own hands must give back his
wealth.
11The youthful vigor that fills his bones
will lie with him in the dust.
12"Though evil is sweet in his mouth and
he hides it under his tongue,
13though he cannot bear to let it go and
keeps it in his mouth,
14yet his food will turn sour in his
stomach; it will become the venom of
serpents within him.
15He will spit out the riches he
swallowed; God will make his stomach
vomit them up.
16He will suck the poison of serpents;
the fangs of an adder will kill him.
17He will not enjoy the streams, the
rivers flowing with honey and cream.
18What he toiled for he must give back
uneaten; he will not enjoy the profit from
his trading.
19For he has oppressed the poor and left
them destitute; he has seized houses he
did not build.
20"Surely he will have no respite from his
craving; he cannot save himself by his
treasure.
21Nothing is left for him to devour; his
prosperity will not endure.
22In the midst of his plenty, distress will
overtake him; the full force of misery will
come upon him.
23When he has filled his belly, God will
vent his burning anger against him and
rain down his blows upon him.
24Though he flees from an iron weapon,
a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him.
25He pulls it out of his back, the
gleaming point out of his liver. Terrors
will come over him;
26total darkness lies in wait for his
treasures. A fire unfanned will consume
him and devour what is left in his tent.
27The heavens will expose his guilt; the
earth will rise up against him.
28A flood will carry off his house, rushing
waters on the day of God's wrath.
29Such is the fate God allots the wicked,
the heritage appointed for them by
God."
21Then Job replied:
2"Listen carefully to my words; let this be
the consolation you give me.
3Bear with me while I speak, and after I
have spoken, mock on.
4"Is my complaint directed to man? Why
should I not be impatient?
5Look at me and be astonished; clap
your hand over your mouth.
6When I think about this, I am terrified;
trembling seizes my body.
7Why do the wicked live on, growing old
and increasing in power?
8They see their children established
around them, their offspring before their
eyes.
9Their homes are safe and free from
fear; the rod of God is not upon them.
10Their bulls never fail to breed; their
cows calve and do not miscarry.
11They send forth their children as a
flock; their little ones dance about.
12They sing to the music of tambourine
and harp; they make merry to the sound
of the flute.
13They spend their years in prosperity
and go down to the grave in peace.
14Yet they say to God, 'Leave us alone!
We have no desire to know your ways.
15Who is the Almighty, that we should
serve him? What would we gain by
praying to him?'
16But their prosperity is not in their own
hands, so I stand aloof from the counsel
of the wicked.
17"Yet how often is the lamp of the
wicked snuffed out? How often does
calamity come upon them, the fate God
allots in his anger?
18How often are they like straw before
the wind, like chaff swept away by a
gale?
19It is said, 'God stores up a man's
punishment for his sons.' Let him repay
the man himself, so that he will know it!
20Let his own eyes see his destruction;
let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
21For what does he care about the
family he leaves behind when his
allotted months come to an end?
22"Can anyone teach knowledge to God,
since he judges even the highest?
23One man dies in full vigor, completely
secure and at ease,
24his body well nourished, his bones rich
with marrow.
25Another man dies in bitterness of soul,
never having enjoyed anything good.
26Side by side they lie in the dust, and
worms cover them both.
27"I know full well what you are thinking,
the schemes by which you would wrong
me.
28You say, 'Where now is the great
man's house, the tents where wicked
men lived?'
29Have you never questioned those who
travel? Have you paid no regard to their
accounts-
30that the evil man is spared from the
day of calamity, that he is delivered from
the day of wrath?
31Who denounces his conduct to his
face? Who repays him for what he has
done?
32He is carried to the grave, and watch
is kept over his tomb.
33The soil in the valley is sweet to him;
all men follow after him, and a countless
throng goes before him.
34"So how can you console me with your
nonsense? Nothing is left of your
answers but falsehood!"
22Then Eliphaz the Temanite
replied:
2"Can a man be of benefit to God? Can
even a wise man benefit him?
3What pleasure would it give the
Almighty if you were righteous? What
would he gain if your ways were
blameless?
4"Is it for your piety that he rebukes you
and brings charges against you?
5Is not your wickedness great? Are not
your sins endless?
6You demanded security from your
brothers for no reason; you stripped
men of their clothing, leaving them
naked.
7You gave no water to the weary and
you withheld food from the hungry,
8though you were a powerful man,
owning land- an honored man, living on
it.
9And you sent widows away emptyhanded
and broke the strength of the
fatherless.
10That is why snares are all around you,
why sudden peril terrifies you,
11why it is so dark you cannot see, and
why a flood of water covers you.
12"Is not God in the heights of heaven?
And see how lofty are the highest stars!
13Yet you say, 'What does God know?
Does he judge through such darkness?
14Thick clouds veil him, so he does not
see us as he goes about in the vaulted
heavens.'
15Will you keep to the old path that evil
men have trod?
16They were carried off before their time,
their foundations washed away by a
flood.
17They said to God, 'Leave us alone!
What can the Almighty do to us?'
18Yet it was he who filled their houses
with good things, so I stand aloof from
the counsel of the wicked.
19"The righteous see their ruin and
rejoice; the innocent mock them, saying,
20'Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire
devours their wealth.'
21"Submit to God and be at peace with
him; in this way prosperity will come to
you.
22Accept instruction from his mouth and
lay up his words in your heart.
23If you return to the Almighty, you will
be restored: If you remove wickedness
far from your tent
24and assign your nuggets to the dust,
your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the
ravines,
25then the Almighty will be your gold, the
choicest silver for you.
26Surely then you will find delight in the
Almighty and will lift up your face to God.
27You will pray to him, and he will hear
you, and you will fulfill your vows.
28What you decide on will be done, and
light will shine on your ways.
29When men are brought low and you
say, 'Lift them up!' then he will save the
downcast.
30He will deliver even one who is not
innocent, who will be delivered through
the cleanness of your hands."
23Then Job replied:
2"Even today my complaint is bitter; his
hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.
3If only I knew where to find him; if only I
could go to his dwelling!
4I would state my case before him and
fill my mouth with arguments.
5I would find out what he would answer
me, and consider what he would say.
6Would he oppose me with great power?
No, he would not press charges against
me.
7There an upright man could present his
case before him, and I would be
delivered forever from my judge.
8"But if I go to the east, he is not there; if
I go to the west, I do not find him.
9When he is at work in the north, I do
not see him; when he turns to the south,
I catch no glimpse of him.
10But he knows the way that I take;
when he has tested me, I will come forth
as gold.
11My feet have closely followed his
steps; I have kept to his way without
turning aside.
12I have not departed from the
commands of his lips; I have treasured
the words of his mouth more than my
daily bread.
13"But he stands alone, and who can
oppose him? He does whatever he
pleases.
14He carries out his decree against me,
and many such plans he still has in
store.
15That is why I am terrified before him;
when I think of all this, I fear him.
16God has made my heart faint; the
Almighty has terrified me.
17Yet I am not silenced by the darkness,
by the thick darkness that covers my
face.
24"Why does the Almighty not set
times for judgment? Why must those
who know him look in vain for such
days?
2Men move boundary stones; they
pasture flocks they have stolen.
3They drive away the orphan's donkey
and take the widow's ox in pledge.
4They thrust the needy from the path
and force all the poor of the land into
hiding.
5Like wild donkeys in the desert, the
poor go about their labor of foraging
food; the wasteland provides food for
their children.
6They gather fodder in the fields and
glean in the vineyards of the wicked.
7Lacking clothes, they spend the night
naked; they have nothing to cover
themselves in the cold.
8They are drenched by mountain rains
and hug the rocks for lack of shelter.
9The fatherless child is snatched from
the breast; the infant of the poor is
seized for a debt.
10Lacking clothes, they go about naked;
they carry the sheaves, but still go
hungry.
11They crush olives among the terraces ;
they tread the winepresses, yet suffer
thirst.
12The groans of the dying rise from the
city, and the souls of the wounded cry
out for help. But God charges no one
with wrongdoing.
13"There are those who rebel against the
light, who do not know its ways or stay
in its paths.
14When daylight is gone, the murderer
rises up and kills the poor and needy; in
the night he steals forth like a thief.
15The eye of the adulterer watches for
dusk; he thinks, 'No eye will see me,'
and he keeps his face concealed.
16In the dark, men break into houses,
but by day they shut themselves in; they
want nothing to do with the light.
17For all of them, deep darkness is their
morning ; they make friends with the
terrors of darkness.
18"Yet they are foam on the surface of
the water; their portion of the land is
cursed, so that no one goes to the
vineyards.
19As heat and drought snatch away the
melted snow, so the grave snatches
away those who have sinned.
20The womb forgets them, the worm
feasts on them; evil men are no longer
remembered but are broken like a tree.
21They prey on the barren and childless
woman, and to the widow show no
kindness.
22But God drags away the mighty by his
power; though they become established,
they have no assurance of life.
23He may let them rest in a feeling of
security, but his eyes are on their ways.
24For a little while they are exalted, and
then they are gone; they are brought low
and gathered up like all others; they are
cut off like heads of grain.
25"If this is not so, who can prove me
false and reduce my words to nothing?"
25Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
2"Dominion and awe belong to God; he
establishes order in the heights of
heaven.
3Can his forces be numbered? Upon
whom does his light not rise?
4How then can a man be righteous
before God? How can one born of
woman be pure?
5If even the moon is not bright and the
stars are not pure in his eyes,
6how much less man, who is but a
maggot- a son of man, who is only a
worm!"
26Then Job replied:
2"How you have helped the powerless!
How you have saved the arm that is
feeble!
3What advice you have offered to one
without wisdom! And what great insight
you have displayed!
4Who has helped you utter these words?
And whose spirit spoke from your
mouth?
5"The dead are in deep anguish, those
beneath the waters and all that live in
them.
6Death is naked before God; Destruction
lies uncovered.
7He spreads out the northern skies over
empty space; he suspends the earth
over nothing.
8He wraps up the waters in his clouds,
yet the clouds do not burst under their
weight.
9He covers the face of the full moon,
spreading his clouds over it.
10He marks out the horizon on the face
of the waters for a boundary between
light and darkness.
11The pillars of the heavens quake,
aghast at his rebuke.
12By his power he churned up the sea;
by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces.
13By his breath the skies became fair;
his hand pierced the gliding serpent.
14And these are but the outer fringe of
his works; how faint the whisper we hear
of him! Who then can understand the
thunder of his power?"
27And Job continued his discourse:
2"As surely as God lives, who has
denied me justice, the Almighty, who
has made me taste bitterness of soul,
3as long as I have life within me, the
breath of God in my nostrils,
4my lips will not speak wickedness, and
my tongue will utter no deceit.
5I will never admit you are in the right; till
I die, I will not deny my integrity.
6I will maintain my righteousness and
never let go of it; my conscience will not
reproach me as long as I live.
7"May my enemies be like the wicked,
my adversaries like the unjust!
8For what hope has the godless when
he is cut off, when God takes away his
life?
9Does God listen to his cry when
distress comes upon him?
10Will he find delight in the Almighty?
Will he call upon God at all times?
11"I will teach you about the power of
God; the ways of the Almighty I will not
conceal.
12You have all seen this yourselves.
Why then this meaningless talk?
13"Here is the fate God allots to the
wicked, the heritage a ruthless man
receives from the Almighty:
14However many his children, their fate
is the sword; his offspring will never
have enough to eat.
15The plague will bury those who survive
him, and their widows will not weep for
them.
16Though he heaps up silver like dust
and clothes like piles of clay,
17what he lays up the righteous will wear,
and the innocent will divide his silver.
18The house he builds is like a moth's
cocoon, like a hut made by a watchman.
19He lies down wealthy, but will do so no
more; when he opens his eyes, all is
gone.
20Terrors overtake him like a flood; a
tempest snatches him away in the night.
21The east wind carries him off, and he
is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.
22It hurls itself against him without mercy
as he flees headlong from its power.
23It claps its hands in derision and
hisses him out of his place.
28"There is a mine for silver and a
place where gold is refined.
2Iron is taken from the earth, and copper
is smelted from ore.
3Man puts an end to the darkness; he
searches the farthest recesses for ore in
the blackest darkness.
4Far from where people dwell he cuts a
shaft, in places forgotten by the foot of
man; far from men he dangles and
sways.
5The earth, from which food comes, is
transformed below as by fire;
6sapphires come from its rocks, and its
dust contains nuggets of gold.
7No bird of prey knows that hidden path,
no falcon's eye has seen it.
8Proud beasts do not set foot on it, and
no lion prowls there.
9Man's hand assaults the flinty rock and
lays bare the roots of the mountains.
10He tunnels through the rock; his eyes
see all its treasures.
11He searches the sources of the rivers
and brings hidden things to light.
12"But where can wisdom be found?
Where does understanding dwell?
13Man does not comprehend its worth; it
cannot be found in the land of the living.
14The deep says, 'It is not in me'; the
sea says, 'It is not with me.'
15It cannot be bought with the finest gold,
nor can its price be weighed in silver.
16It cannot be bought with the gold of
Ophir, with precious onyx or sapphires.
17Neither gold nor crystal can compare
with it, nor can it be had for jewels of
gold.
18Coral and jasper are not worthy of
mention; the price of wisdom is beyond
rubies.
19The topaz of Cush cannot compare
with it; it cannot be bought with pure
gold.
20"Where then does wisdom come from?
Where does understanding dwell?
21It is hidden from the eyes of every
living thing, concealed even from the
birds of the air.
22Destruction and Death say, 'Only a
rumor of it has reached our ears.'
23God understands the way to it and he
alone knows where it dwells,
24for he views the ends of the earth and
sees everything under the heavens.
25When he established the force of the
wind and measured out the waters,
26when he made a decree for the rain
and a path for the thunderstorm,
27then he looked at wisdom and
appraised it; he confirmed it and tested
it.
28And he said to man, 'The fear of the
Lord-that is wisdom, and to shun evil is
understanding.' "
29Job continued his discourse:
2"How I long for the months gone by, for
the days when God watched over me,
3when his lamp shone upon my head
and by his light I walked through
darkness!
4Oh, for the days when I was in my
prime, when God's intimate friendship
blessed my house,
5when the Almighty was still with me and
my children were around me,
6when my path was drenched with
cream and the rock poured out for me
streams of olive oil.
7"When I went to the gate of the city and
took my seat in the public square,
8the young men saw me and stepped
aside and the old men rose to their feet;
9the chief men refrained from speaking
and covered their mouths with their
hands;
10the voices of the nobles were hushed,
and their tongues stuck to the roof of
their mouths.
11Whoever heard me spoke well of me,
and those who saw me commended me,
12because I rescued the poor who cried
for help, and the fatherless who had
none to assist him.
13The man who was dying blessed me; I
made the widow's heart sing.
14I put on righteousness as my clothing;
justice was my robe and my turban.
15I was eyes to the blind and feet to the
lame.
16I was a father to the needy; I took up
the case of the stranger.
17I broke the fangs of the wicked and
snatched the victims from their teeth.
18"I thought, 'I will die in my own house,
my days as numerous as the grains of
sand.
19My roots will reach to the water, and
the dew will lie all night on my branches.
20My glory will remain fresh in me, the
bow ever new in my hand.'
21"Men listened to me expectantly,
waiting in silence for my counsel.
22After I had spoken, they spoke no
more; my words fell gently on their ears.
23They waited for me as for showers and
drank in my words as the spring rain.
24When I smiled at them, they scarcely
believed it; the light of my face was
precious to them.
25I chose the way for them and sat as
their chief; I dwelt as a king among his
troops; I was like one who comforts
mourners.
30"But now they mock me, men
younger than I, whose fathers I would
have disdained to put with my sheep
dogs.
2Of what use was the strength of their
hands to me, since their vigor had gone
from them?
3Haggard from want and hunger, they
roamed the parched land in desolate
wastelands at night.
4In the brush they gathered salt herbs,
and their food was the root of the broom
tree.
5They were banished from their fellow
men, shouted at as if they were thieves.
6They were forced to live in the dry
stream beds, among the rocks and in
holes in the ground.
7They brayed among the bushes and
huddled in the undergrowth.
8A base and nameless brood, they were
driven out of the land.
9"And now their sons mock me in song; I
have become a byword among them.
10They detest me and keep their
distance; they do not hesitate to spit in
my face.
11Now that God has unstrung my bow
and afflicted me, they throw off restraint
in my presence.
12On my right the tribe attacks; they lay
snares for my feet, they build their siege
ramps against me.
13They break up my road; they succeed
in destroying me- without anyone's
helping them.
14They advance as through a gaping
breach; amid the ruins they come rolling
in.
15Terrors overwhelm me; my dignity is
driven away as by the wind, my safety
vanishes like a cloud.
16"And now my life ebbs away; days of
suffering grip me.
17Night pierces my bones; my gnawing
pains never rest.
18In his great power God becomes like
clothing to me ; he binds me like the
neck of my garment.
19He throws me into the mud, and I am
reduced to dust and ashes.
20"I cry out to you, O God, but you do
not answer; I stand up, but you merely
look at me.
21You turn on me ruthlessly; with the
might of your hand you attack me.
22You snatch me up and drive me before
the wind; you toss me about in the storm.
23I know you will bring me down to death,
to the place appointed for all the living.
24"Surely no one lays a hand on a
broken man when he cries for help in his
distress.
25Have I not wept for those in trouble?
Has not my soul grieved for the poor?
26Yet when I hoped for good, evil came;
when I looked for light, then came
darkness.
27The churning inside me never stops;
days of suffering confront me.
28I go about blackened, but not by the
sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry
for help.
29I have become a brother of jackals, a
companion of owls.
30My skin grows black and peels; my
body burns with fever.
31My harp is tuned to mourning, and my
flute to the sound of wailing.
31"I made a covenant with my eyes
not to look lustfully at a girl.
2For what is man's lot from God above,
his heritage from the Almighty on high?
3Is it not ruin for the wicked, disaster for
those who do wrong?
4Does he not see my ways and count
my every step?
5"If I have walked in falsehood or my
foot has hurried after deceit-
6let God weigh me in honest scales and
he will know that I am blameless-
7if my steps have turned from the path, if
my heart has been led by my eyes, or if
my hands have been defiled,
8then may others eat what I have sown,
and may my crops be uprooted.
9"If my heart has been enticed by a
woman, or if I have lurked at my
neighbor's door,
10then may my wife grind another man's
grain, and may other men sleep with her.
11For that would have been shameful, a
sin to be judged.
12It is a fire that burns to Destruction ; it
would have uprooted my harvest.
13"If I have denied justice to my
menservants and maidservants when
they had a grievance against me,
14what will I do when God confronts me?
What will I answer when called to
account?
15Did not he who made me in the womb
make them? Did not the same one form
us both within our mothers?
16"If I have denied the desires of the
poor or let the eyes of the widow grow
weary,
17if I have kept my bread to myself, not
sharing it with the fatherless-
18but from my youth I reared him as
would a father, and from my birth I
guided the widow-
19if I have seen anyone perishing for
lack of clothing, or a needy man without
a garment,
20and his heart did not bless me for
warming him with the fleece from my
sheep,
21if I have raised my hand against the
fatherless, knowing that I had influence
in court,
22then let my arm fall from the shoulder,
let it be broken off at the joint.
23For I dreaded destruction from God,
and for fear of his splendor I could not
do such things.
24"If I have put my trust in gold or said to
pure gold, 'You are my security,'
25if I have rejoiced over my great wealth,
the fortune my hands had gained,
26if I have regarded the sun in its
radiance or the moon moving in
splendor,
27so that my heart was secretly enticed
and my hand offered them a kiss of
homage,
28then these also would be sins to be
judged, for I would have been unfaithful
to God on high.
29"If I have rejoiced at my enemy's
misfortune or gloated over the trouble
that came to him-
30I have not allowed my mouth to sin by
invoking a curse against his life-
31if the men of my household have never
said, 'Who has not had his fill of Job's
meat?'-
32but no stranger had to spend the night
in the street, for my door was always
open to the traveler-
33if I have concealed my sin as men do,
by hiding my guilt in my heart
34because I so feared the crowd and so
dreaded the contempt of the clans that I
kept silent and would not go outside
35("Oh, that I had someone to hear me! I
sign now my defense-let the Almighty
answer me; let my accuser put his
indictment in writing.
36Surely I would wear it on my shoulder,
I would put it on like a crown.
37I would give him an account of my
every step; like a prince I would
approach him.)-
38"if my land cries out against me and all
its furrows are wet with tears,
39if I have devoured its yield without
payment or broken the spirit of its
tenants,
40then let briers come up instead of
wheat and weeds instead of barley."
The words of Job are ended.
32So these three men stopped
answering Job, because he was
righteous in his own eyes.
2But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of
the family of Ram, became very angry
with Job for justifying himself rather than
God.
3He was also angry with the three
friends, because they had found no way
to refute Job, and yet had condemned
him.
4Now Elihu had waited before speaking
to Job because they were older than he.
5But when he saw that the three men
had nothing more to say, his anger was
aroused.
6So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said:
"I am young in years, and you are old;
that is why I was fearful, not daring to
tell you what I know.
7I thought, 'Age should speak; advanced
years should teach wisdom.'
8But it is the spirit in a man, the breath of
the Almighty, that gives him
understanding.
9It is not only the old who are wise, not
only the aged who understand what is
right.
10"Therefore I say: Listen to me; I too will
tell you what I know.
11I waited while you spoke, I listened to
your reasoning; while you were
searching for words,
12I gave you my full attention. But not
one of you has proved Job wrong; none
of you has answered his arguments.
13Do not say, 'We have found wisdom;
let God refute him, not man.'
14But Job has not marshaled his words
against me, and I will not answer him
with your arguments.
15"They are dismayed and have no more
to say; words have failed them.
16Must I wait, now that they are silent,
now that they stand there with no reply?
17I too will have my say; I too will tell
what I know.
18For I am full of words, and the spirit
within me compels me;
19inside I am like bottled-up wine, like
new wineskins ready to burst.
20I must speak and find relief; I must
open my lips and reply.
21I will show partiality to no one, nor will I
flatter any man;
22for if I were skilled in flattery, my
Maker would soon take me away.
33"But now, Job, listen to my words;
pay attention to everything I say.
2I am about to open my mouth; my
words are on the tip of my tongue.
3My words come from an upright heart;
my lips sincerely speak what I know.
4The Spirit of God has made me; the
breath of the Almighty gives me life.
5Answer me then, if you can; prepare
yourself and confront me.
6I am just like you before God; I too
have been taken from clay.
7No fear of me should alarm you, nor
should my hand be heavy upon you.
8"But you have said in my hearing- I
heard the very words-
9'I am pure and without sin; I am clean
and free from guilt.
10Yet God has found fault with me; he
considers me his enemy.
11He fastens my feet in shackles; he
keeps close watch on all my paths.'
12"But I tell you, in this you are not right,
for God is greater than man.
13Why do you complain to him that he
answers none of man's words ?
14For God does speak-now one way,
now another- though man may not
perceive it.
15In a dream, in a vision of the night,
when deep sleep falls on men as they
slumber in their beds,
16he may speak in their ears and terrify
them with warnings,
17to turn man from wrongdoing and keep
him from pride,
18to preserve his soul from the pit, his
life from perishing by the sword.
19Or a man may be chastened on a bed
of pain with constant distress in his
bones,
20so that his very being finds food
repulsive and his soul loathes the
choicest meal.
21His flesh wastes away to nothing, and
his bones, once hidden, now stick out.
22His soul draws near to the pit, and his
life to the messengers of death.
23"Yet if there is an angel on his side as
a mediator, one out of a thousand, to tell
a man what is right for him,
24to be gracious to him and say, 'Spare
him from going down to the pit ; I have
found a ransom for him'-
25then his flesh is renewed like a child's;
it is restored as in the days of his youth.
26He prays to God and finds favor with
him, he sees God's face and shouts for
joy; he is restored by God to his
righteous state.
27Then he comes to men and says, 'I
sinned, and perverted what was right,
but I did not get what I deserved.
28He redeemed my soul from going
down to the pit, and I will live to enjoy
the light.'
29"God does all these things to a mantwice,
even three times-
30to turn back his soul from the pit, that
the light of life may shine on him.
31"Pay attention, Job, and listen to me;
be silent, and I will speak.
32If you have anything to say, answer
me; speak up, for I want you to be
cleared.
33But if not, then listen to me; be silent,
and I will teach you wisdom."
34Then Elihu said:
2"Hear my words, you wise men; listen
to me, you men of learning.
3For the ear tests words as the tongue
tastes food.
4Let us discern for ourselves what is
right; let us learn together what is good.
5"Job says, 'I am innocent, but God
denies me justice.
6Although I am right, I am considered a
liar; although I am guiltless, his arrow
inflicts an incurable wound.'
7What man is like Job, who drinks scorn
like water?
8He keeps company with evildoers; he
associates with wicked men.
9For he says, 'It profits a man nothing
when he tries to please God.'
10"So listen to me, you men of
understanding. Far be it from God to do
evil, from the Almighty to do wrong.
11He repays a man for what he has
done; he brings upon him what his
conduct deserves.
12It is unthinkable that God would do
wrong, that the Almighty would pervert
justice.
13Who appointed him over the earth?
Who put him in charge of the whole
world?
14If it were his intention and he withdrew
his spirit and breath,
15all mankind would perish together and
man would return to the dust.
16"If you have understanding, hear this;
listen to what I say.
17Can he who hates justice govern? Will
you condemn the just and mighty One?
18Is he not the One who says to kings,
'You are worthless,' and to nobles, 'You
are wicked,'
19who shows no partiality to princes and
does not favor the rich over the poor, for
they are all the work of his hands?
20They die in an instant, in the middle of
the night; the people are shaken and
they pass away; the mighty are removed
without human hand.
21"His eyes are on the ways of men; he
sees their every step.
22There is no dark place, no deep
shadow, where evildoers can hide.
23God has no need to examine men
further, that they should come before
him for judgment.
24Without inquiry he shatters the mighty
and sets up others in their place.
25Because he takes note of their deeds,
he overthrows them in the night and
they are crushed.
26He punishes them for their wickedness
where everyone can see them,
27because they turned from following
him and had no regard for any of his
ways.
28They caused the cry of the poor to
come before him, so that he heard the
cry of the needy.
29But if he remains silent, who can
condemn him? If he hides his face, who
can see him? Yet he is over man and
nation alike,
30to keep a godless man from ruling,
from laying snares for the people.
31"Suppose a man says to God, 'I am
guilty but will offend no more.
32Teach me what I cannot see; if I have
done wrong, I will not do so again.'
33Should God then reward you on your
terms, when you refuse to repent? You
must decide, not I; so tell me what you
know.
34"Men of understanding declare, wise
men who hear me say to me,
35'Job speaks without knowledge; his
words lack insight.'
36Oh, that Job might be tested to the
utmost for answering like a wicked man!
37To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully
he claps his hands among us and
multiplies his words against God."
35Then Elihu said:
2"Do you think this is just? You say, 'I
will be cleared by God. '
3Yet you ask him, 'What profit is it to me,
and what do I gain by not sinning?'
4"I would like to reply to you and to your
friends with you.
5Look up at the heavens and see; gaze
at the clouds so high above you.
6If you sin, how does that affect him? If
your sins are many, what does that do
to him?
7If you are righteous, what do you give
to him, or what does he receive from
your hand?
8Your wickedness affects only a man
like yourself, and your righteousness
only the sons of men.
9"Men cry out under a load of
oppression; they plead for relief from the
arm of the powerful.
10But no one says, 'Where is God my
Maker, who gives songs in the night,
11who teaches more to us than to the
beasts of the earth and makes us wiser
than the birds of the air?'
12He does not answer when men cry out
because of the arrogance of the wicked.
13Indeed, God does not listen to their
empty plea; the Almighty pays no
attention to it.
14How much less, then, will he listen
when you say that you do not see him,
that your case is before him and you
must wait for him,
15and further, that his anger never
punishes and he does not take the least
notice of wickedness.
16So Job opens his mouth with empty
talk; without knowledge he multiplies
words."
36Elihu continued:
2"Bear with me a little longer and I will
show you that there is more to be said in
God's behalf.
3I get my knowledge from afar; I will
ascribe justice to my Maker.
4Be assured that my words are not false;
one perfect in knowledge is with you.
5"God is mighty, but does not despise
men; he is mighty, and firm in his
purpose.
6He does not keep the wicked alive but
gives the afflicted their rights.
7He does not take his eyes off the
righteous; he enthrones them with kings
and exalts them forever.
8But if men are bound in chains, held
fast by cords of affliction,
9he tells them what they have done- that
they have sinned arrogantly.
10He makes them listen to correction
and commands them to repent of their
evil.
11If they obey and serve him, they will
spend the rest of their days in prosperity
and their years in contentment.
12But if they do not listen, they will perish
by the sword and die without knowledge.
13"The godless in heart harbor
resentment; even when he fetters them,
they do not cry for help.
14They die in their youth, among male
prostitutes of the shrines.
15But those who suffer he delivers in
their suffering; he speaks to them in
their affliction.
16"He is wooing you from the jaws of
distress to a spacious place free from
restriction, to the comfort of your table
laden with choice food.
17But now you are laden with the
judgment due the wicked; judgment and
justice have taken hold of you.
18Be careful that no one entices you by
riches; do not let a large bribe turn you
aside.
19Would your wealth or even all your
mighty efforts sustain you so you would
not be in distress?
20Do not long for the night, to drag
people away from their homes.
21Beware of turning to evil, which you
seem to prefer to affliction.
22"God is exalted in his power. Who is a
teacher like him?
23Who has prescribed his ways for him,
or said to him, 'You have done wrong'?
24Remember to extol his work, which
men have praised in song.
25All mankind has seen it; men gaze on
it from afar.
26How great is God-beyond our
understanding! The number of his years
is past finding out.
27"He draws up the drops of water,
which distill as rain to the streams ;
28the clouds pour down their moisture
and abundant showers fall on mankind.
29Who can understand how he spreads
out the clouds, how he thunders from
his pavilion?
30See how he scatters his lightning
about him, bathing the depths of the sea.
31This is the way he governs the nations
and provides food in abundance.
32He fills his hands with lightning and
commands it to strike its mark.
33His thunder announces the coming
storm; even the cattle make known its
approach.
37"At this my heart pounds and
leaps from its place.
2Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice, to
the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
3He unleashes his lightning beneath the
whole heaven and sends it to the ends
of the earth.
4After that comes the sound of his roar;
he thunders with his majestic voice.
When his voice resounds, he holds
nothing back.
5God's voice thunders in marvelous
ways; he does great things beyond our
understanding.
6He says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth,'
and to the rain shower, 'Be a mighty
downpour.'
7So that all men he has made may know
his work, he stops every man from his
labor.
8The animals take cover; they remain in
their dens.
9The tempest comes out from its
chamber, the cold from the driving winds.
10The breath of God produces ice, and
the broad waters become frozen.
11He loads the clouds with moisture; he
scatters his lightning through them.
12At his direction they swirl around over
the face of the whole earth to do
whatever he commands them.
13He brings the clouds to punish men, or
to water his earth and show his love.
14"Listen to this, Job; stop and consider
God's wonders.
15Do you know how God controls the
clouds and makes his lightning flash?
16Do you know how the clouds hang
poised, those wonders of him who is
perfect in knowledge?
17You who swelter in your clothes when
the land lies hushed under the south
wind,
18can you join him in spreading out the
skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze?
19"Tell us what we should say to him; we
cannot draw up our case because of our
darkness.
20Should he be told that I want to
speak? Would any man ask to be
swallowed up?
21Now no one can look at the sun, bright
as it is in the skies after the wind has
swept them clean.
22Out of the north he comes in golden
splendor; God comes in awesome
majesty.
23The Almighty is beyond our reach and
exalted in power; in his justice and great
righteousness, he does not oppress.
24Therefore, men revere him, for does
he not have regard for all the wise in
heart? "
38Then the Lord answered Job out
of the storm. He said:
2"Who is this that darkens my counsel
with words without knowledge?
3Brace yourself like a man; I will
question you, and you shall answer me.
4"Where were you when I laid the earth's
foundation? Tell me, if you understand.
5Who marked off its dimensions? Surely
you know! Who stretched a measuring
line across it?
6On what were its footings set, or who
laid its cornerstone-
7while the morning stars sang together
and all the angels shouted for joy?
8"Who shut up the sea behind doors
when it burst forth from the womb,
9when I made the clouds its garment
and wrapped it in thick darkness,
10when I fixed limits for it and set its
doors and bars in place,
11when I said, 'This far you may come
and no farther; here is where your proud
waves halt'?
12"Have you ever given orders to the
morning, or shown the dawn its place,
13that it might take the earth by the
edges and shake the wicked out of it?
14The earth takes shape like clay under
a seal; its features stand out like those
of a garment.
15The wicked are denied their light, and
their upraised arm is broken.
16"Have you journeyed to the springs of
the sea or walked in the recesses of the
deep?
17Have the gates of death been shown
to you? Have you seen the gates of the
shadow of death ?
18Have you comprehended the vast
expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you
know all this.
19"What is the way to the abode of light?
And where does darkness reside?
20Can you take them to their places? Do
you know the paths to their dwellings?
21Surely you know, for you were already
born! You have lived so many years!
22"Have you entered the storehouses of
the snow or seen the storehouses of the
hail,
23which I reserve for times of trouble, for
days of war and battle?
24What is the way to the place where the
lightning is dispersed, or the place
where the east winds are scattered over
the earth?
25Who cuts a channel for the torrents of
rain, and a path for the thunderstorm,
26to water a land where no man lives, a
desert with no one in it,
27to satisfy a desolate wasteland and
make it sprout with grass?
28Does the rain have a father? Who
fathers the drops of dew?
29From whose womb comes the ice?
Who gives birth to the frost from the
heavens
30when the waters become hard as
stone, when the surface of the deep is
frozen?
31"Can you bind the beautiful Pleiades?
Can you loose the cords of Orion?
32Can you bring forth the constellations
in their seasons or lead out the Bear
with its cubs?
33Do you know the laws of the heavens?
Can you set up God's dominion over the
earth?
34"Can you raise your voice to the
clouds and cover yourself with a flood of
water?
35Do you send the lightning bolts on
their way? Do they report to you, 'Here
we are'?
36Who endowed the heart with wisdom
or gave understanding to the mind ?
37Who has the wisdom to count the
clouds? Who can tip over the water jars
of the heavens
38when the dust becomes hard and the
clods of earth stick together?
39"Do you hunt the prey for the lioness
and satisfy the hunger of the lions
40when they crouch in their dens or lie in
wait in a thicket?
41Who provides food for the raven when
its young cry out to God and wander
about for lack of food?
39"Do you know when the mountain
goats give birth? Do you watch when
the doe bears her fawn?
2Do you count the months till they bear?
Do you know the time they give birth?
3They crouch down and bring forth their
young; their labor pains are ended.
4Their young thrive and grow strong in
the wilds; they leave and do not return.
5"Who let the wild donkey go free? Who
untied his ropes?
6I gave him the wasteland as his home,
the salt flats as his habitat.
7He laughs at the commotion in the
town; he does not hear a driver's shout.
8He ranges the hills for his pasture and
searches for any green thing.
9"Will the wild ox consent to serve you?
Will he stay by your manger at night?
10Can you hold him to the furrow with a
harness? Will he till the valleys behind
you?
11Will you rely on him for his great
strength? Will you leave your heavy
work to him?
12Can you trust him to bring in your grain
and gather it to your threshing floor?
13"The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully,
but they cannot compare with the
pinions and feathers of the stork.
14She lays her eggs on the ground and
lets them warm in the sand,
15unmindful that a foot may crush them,
that some wild animal may trample them.
16She treats her young harshly, as if
they were not hers; she cares not that
her labor was in vain,
17for God did not endow her with
wisdom or give her a share of good
sense.
18Yet when she spreads her feathers to
run, she laughs at horse and rider.
19"Do you give the horse his strength or
clothe his neck with a flowing mane?
20Do you make him leap like a locust,
striking terror with his proud snorting?
21He paws fiercely, rejoicing in his
strength, and charges into the fray.
22He laughs at fear, afraid of nothing; he
does not shy away from the sword.
23The quiver rattles against his side,
along with the flashing spear and lance.
24In frenzied excitement he eats up the
ground; he cannot stand still when the
trumpet sounds.
25At the blast of the trumpet he snorts,
'Aha!' He catches the scent of battle
from afar, the shout of commanders and
the battle cry.
26"Does the hawk take flight by your
wisdom and spread his wings toward
the south?
27Does the eagle soar at your command
and build his nest on high?
28He dwells on a cliff and stays there at
night; a rocky crag is his stronghold.
29From there he seeks out his food; his
eyes detect it from afar.
30His young ones feast on blood, and
where the slain are, there is he."
40The Lord said to Job:
2"Will the one who contends with the
Almighty correct him? Let him who
accuses God answer him!"
3Then Job answered the Lord :
4"I am unworthy-how can I reply to you?
I put my hand over my mouth.
5I spoke once, but I have no answertwice,
but I will say no more."
6Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the
storm:
7"Brace yourself like a man; I will
question you, and you shall answer me.
8"Would you discredit my justice? Would
you condemn me to justify yourself?
9Do you have an arm like God's, and
can your voice thunder like his?
10Then adorn yourself with glory and
splendor, and clothe yourself in honor
and majesty.
11Unleash the fury of your wrath, look at
every proud man and bring him low,
12look at every proud man and humble
him, crush the wicked where they stand.
13Bury them all in the dust together;
shroud their faces in the grave.
14Then I myself will admit to you that
your own right hand can save you.
15"Look at the behemoth, which I made
along with you and which feeds on
grass like an ox.
16What strength he has in his loins, what
power in the muscles of his belly!
17His tail sways like a cedar; the sinews
of his thighs are close-knit.
18His bones are tubes of bronze, his
limbs like rods of iron.
19He ranks first among the works of God,
yet his Maker can approach him with his
sword.
20The hills bring him their produce, and
all the wild animals play nearby.
21Under the lotus plants he lies, hidden
among the reeds in the marsh.
22The lotuses conceal him in their
shadow; the poplars by the stream
surround him.
23When the river rages, he is not
alarmed; he is secure, though the
Jordan should surge against his mouth.
24Can anyone capture him by the eyes,
or trap him and pierce his nose?
41"Can you pull in the leviathan with
a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a
rope?
2Can you put a cord through his nose or
pierce his jaw with a hook?
3Will he keep begging you for mercy?
Will he speak to you with gentle words?
4Will he make an agreement with you for
you to take him as your slave for life?
5Can you make a pet of him like a bird
or put him on a leash for your girls?
6Will traders barter for him? Will they
divide him up among the merchants?
7Can you fill his hide with harpoons or
his head with fishing spears?
8If you lay a hand on him, you will
remember the struggle and never do it
again!
9Any hope of subduing him is false; the
mere sight of him is overpowering.
10No one is fierce enough to rouse him.
Who then is able to stand against me?
11Who has a claim against me that I
must pay? Everything under heaven
belongs to me.
12"I will not fail to speak of his limbs, his
strength and his graceful form.
13Who can strip off his outer coat? Who
would approach him with a bridle?
14Who dares open the doors of his
mouth, ringed about with his fearsome
teeth?
15His back has rows of shields tightly
sealed together;
16each is so close to the next that no air
can pass between.
17They are joined fast to one another;
they cling together and cannot be parted.
18His snorting throws out flashes of light;
his eyes are like the rays of dawn.
19Firebrands stream from his mouth;
sparks of fire shoot out.
20Smoke pours from his nostrils as from
a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.
21His breath sets coals ablaze, and
flames dart from his mouth.
22Strength resides in his neck; dismay
goes before him.
23The folds of his flesh are tightly joined;
they are firm and immovable.
24His chest is hard as rock, hard as a
lower millstone.
25When he rises up, the mighty are
terrified; they retreat before his
thrashing.
26The sword that reaches him has no
effect, nor does the spear or the dart or
the javelin.
27Iron he treats like straw and bronze
like rotten wood.
28Arrows do not make him flee;
slingstones are like chaff to him.
29A club seems to him but a piece of
straw; he laughs at the rattling of the
lance.
30His undersides are jagged potsherds,
leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing
sledge.
31He makes the depths churn like a
boiling caldron and stirs up the sea like
a pot of ointment.
32Behind him he leaves a glistening
wake; one would think the deep had
white hair.
33Nothing on earth is his equal- a
creature without fear.
34He looks down on all that are haughty;
he is king over all that are proud."
42Then Job replied to the Lord :
2"I know that you can do all things; no
plan of yours can be thwarted.
3You asked, 'Who is this that obscures
my counsel without knowledge?' Surely I
spoke of things I did not understand,
things too wonderful for me to know.
4"You said, 'Listen now, and I will speak;
I will question you, and you shall answer
me.'
5My ears had heard of you but now my
eyes have seen you.
6Therefore I despise myself and repent
in dust and ashes."
7After the Lord had said these things to
Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "I
am angry with you and your two friends,
because you have not spoken of me
what is right, as my servant Job has.
8So now take seven bulls and seven
rams and go to my servant Job and
sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves.
My servant Job will pray for you, and I
will accept his prayer and not deal with
you according to your folly. You have
not spoken of me what is right, as my
servant Job has."
9So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the
Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did
what the Lord told them; and the Lord
accepted Job's prayer.
10After Job had prayed for his friends,
the Lord made him prosperous again
and gave him twice as much as he had
before.
11All his brothers and sisters and
everyone who had known him before
came and ate with him in his house.
They comforted and consoled him over
all the trouble the Lord had brought
upon him, and each one gave him a
piece of silver and a gold ring.
12The Lord blessed the latter part of
Job's life more than the first. He had
fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand
camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a
thousand donkeys.
13And he also had seven sons and three
daughters.
14The first daughter he named Jemimah,
the second Keziah and the third Keren-
Happuch.
15Nowhere in all the land were there
found women as beautiful as Job's
daughters, and their father granted them
an inheritance along with their brothers.
16After this, Job lived a hundred and
forty years; he saw his children and their
children to the fourth generation.
17And so he died, old and full of years.
Psalms
PSALM 1
1Blessed is the man who does not walk
in the counsel of the wicked or stand in
the way of sinners or sit in the seat of
mockers.
2But his delight is in the law of the Lord,
and on his law he meditates day and
night.
3He is like a tree planted by streams of
water, which yields its fruit in season
and whose leaf does not wither.
Whatever he does prospers.
4Not so the wicked! They are like chaff
that the wind blows away.
5Therefore the wicked will not stand in
the judgment, nor sinners in the
assembly of the righteous.
6For the Lord watches over the way of
the righteous, but the way of the wicked
will perish.
PSALM 2
1Why do the nations conspire and the
peoples plot in vain?
2The kings of the earth take their stand
and the rulers gather together against
the Lord and against his Anointed One.
3"Let us break their chains," they say,
"and throw off their fetters."
4The One enthroned in heaven laughs;
the Lord scoffs at them.
5Then he rebukes them in his anger and
terrifies them in his wrath, saying,
6"I have installed my King on Zion, my
holy hill."
7I will proclaim the decree of the Lord :
He said to me, "You are my Son ; today
I have become your Father.
8Ask of me, and I will make the nations
your inheritance, the ends of the earth
your possession.
9You will rule them with an iron scepter ;
you will dash them to pieces like
pottery."
10Therefore, you kings, be wise; be
warned, you rulers of the earth.
11Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice
with trembling.
12Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and you
be destroyed in your way, for his wrath
can flare up in a moment. Blessed are
all who take refuge in him.
PSALM 3
1O Lord , how many are my foes! How
many rise up against me!
2Many are saying of me, "God will not
deliver him." Selah
3But you are a shield around me, O
Lord ; you bestow glory on me and lift
up my head.
4To the Lord I cry aloud, and he answers
me from his holy hill. Selah
5I lie down and sleep; I wake again,
because the Lord sustains me.
6I will not fear the tens of thousands
drawn up against me on every side.
7Arise, O Lord ! Deliver me, O my God!
Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break
the teeth of the wicked.
8From the Lord comes deliverance. May
your blessing be on your people. Selah
PSALM 4
1Answer me when I call to you, O my
righteous God. Give me relief from my
distress; be merciful to me and hear my
prayer.
2How long, O men, will you turn my glory
into shame ? How long will you love
delusions and seek false gods ? Selah
3Know that the Lord has set apart the
godly for himself; the Lord will hear
when I call to him.
4In your anger do not sin; when you are
on your beds, search your hearts and be
silent. Selah
5Offer right sacrifices and trust in the
Lord .
6Many are asking, "Who can show us
any good?" Let the light of your face
shine upon us, O Lord .
7You have filled my heart with greater
joy than when their grain and new wine
abound.
8I will lie down and sleep in peace, for
you alone, O Lord , make me dwell in
safety.
PSALM 5
1Give ear to my words, O Lord ,
consider my sighing.
2Listen to my cry for help, my King and
my God, for to you I pray.
3In the morning, O Lord , you hear my
voice; in the morning I lay my requests
before you and wait in expectation.
4You are not a God who takes pleasure
in evil; with you the wicked cannot dwell.
5The arrogant cannot stand in your
presence; you hate all who do wrong.
6You destroy those who tell lies;
bloodthirsty and deceitful men the Lord
abhors.
7But I, by your great mercy, will come
into your house; in reverence will I bow
down toward your holy temple.
8Lead me, O Lord , in your
righteousness because of my enemiesmake
straight your way before me.
9Not a word from their mouth can be
trusted; their heart is filled with
destruction. Their throat is an open
grave; with their tongue they speak
deceit.
10Declare them guilty, O God! Let their
intrigues be their downfall. Banish them
for their many sins, for they have
rebelled against you.
11But let all who take refuge in you be
glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread
your protection over them, that those
who love your name may rejoice in you.
12For surely, O Lord , you bless the
righteous; you surround them with your
favor as with a shield.
PSALM 6
1O Lord , do not rebuke me in your
anger or discipline me in your wrath.
2Be merciful to me, Lord , for I am faint;
O Lord , heal me, for my bones are in
agony.
3My soul is in anguish. How long, O
Lord , how long?
4Turn, O Lord , and deliver me; save me
because of your unfailing love.
5No one remembers you when he is
dead. Who praises you from the grave
1 ?
6I am worn out from groaning; all night
long I flood my bed with weeping and
drench my couch with tears.
7My eyes grow weak with sorrow; they
fail because of all my foes.
8Away from me, all you who do evil, for
the Lord has heard my weeping.
9The Lord has heard my cry for mercy;
the Lord accepts my prayer.
10All my enemies will be ashamed and
dismayed; they will turn back in sudden
disgrace.
PSALM 7
1O Lord my God, I take refuge in you;
save and deliver me from all who pursue
me,
2or they will tear me like a lion and rip
me to pieces with no one to rescue me.
3O Lord my God, if I have done this and
there is guilt on my hands-
4if I have done evil to him who is at
peace with me or without cause have
robbed my foe-
5then let my enemy pursue and overtake
me; let him trample my life to the ground
and make me sleep in the dust. Selah
6Arise, O Lord , in your anger; rise up
against the rage of my enemies. Awake,
my God; decree justice.
7Let the assembled peoples gather
around you. Rule over them from on
high;
8let the Lord judge the peoples. Judge
me, O Lord , according to my
righteousness, according to my integrity,
O Most High.
9O righteous God, who searches minds
and hearts, bring to an end the violence
of the wicked and make the righteous
secure.
10My shield is God Most High, who
saves the upright in heart.
11God is a righteous judge, a God who
expresses his wrath every day.
12If he does not relent, he will sharpen
his sword; he will bend and string his
bow.
13He has prepared his deadly weapons;
he makes ready his flaming arrows.
14He who is pregnant with evil and
conceives trouble gives birth to
disillusionment.
15He who digs a hole and scoops it out
falls into the pit he has made.
16The trouble he causes recoils on
himself; his violence comes down on his
own head.
17I will give thanks to the Lord because
of his righteousness and will sing praise
to the name of the Lord Most High.
PSALM 8
1O Lord , our Lord, how majestic is your
name in all the earth! You have set your
glory above the heavens.
2From the lips of children and infants
you have ordained praise because of
your enemies, to silence the foe and the
avenger.
3When I consider your heavens, the
work of your fingers, the moon and the
stars, which you have set in place,
4what is man that you are mindful of him,
the son of man that you care for him?
5You made him a little lower than the
heavenly beings and crowned him with
glory and honor.
6You made him ruler over the works of
your hands; you put everything under
his feet:
7all flocks and herds, and the beasts of
the field,
8the birds of the air, and the fish of the
sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.
9O Lord , our Lord, how majestic is your
name in all the earth!
PSALM 9
1I will praise you, O Lord , with all my
heart; I will tell of all your wonders.
2I will be glad and rejoice in you; I will
sing praise to your name, O Most High.
3My enemies turn back; they stumble
and perish before you.
4For you have upheld my right and my
cause; you have sat on your throne,
judging righteously.
5You have rebuked the nations and
destroyed the wicked; you have blotted
out their name for ever and ever.
6Endless ruin has overtaken the enemy,
you have uprooted their cities; even the
memory of them has perished.
7The Lord reigns forever; he has
established his throne for judgment.
8He will judge the world in
righteousness; he will govern the
peoples with justice.
9The Lord is a refuge for the oppressed,
a stronghold in times of trouble.
10Those who know your name will trust
in you, for you, Lord , have never
forsaken those who seek you.
11Sing praises to the Lord , enthroned in
Zion; proclaim among the nations what
he has done.
12For he who avenges blood
remembers; he does not ignore the cry
of the afflicted.
13O Lord , see how my enemies
persecute me! Have mercy and lift me
up from the gates of death,
14that I may declare your praises in the
gates of the Daughter of Zion and there
rejoice in your salvation.
15The nations have fallen into the pit
they have dug; their feet are caught in
the net they have hidden.
16The Lord is known by his justice; the
wicked are ensnared by the work of their
hands. Higgaion. Selah
17The wicked return to the grave, all the
nations that forget God.
18But the needy will not always be
forgotten, nor the hope of the afflicted
ever perish.
19Arise, O Lord , let not man triumph; let
the nations be judged in your presence.
20Strike them with terror, O Lord ; let the
nations know they are but men. Selah
PSALM 10
1Why, O Lord , do you stand far off?
Why do you hide yourself in times of
trouble?
2In his arrogance the wicked man hunts
down the weak, who are caught in the
schemes he devises.
3He boasts of the cravings of his heart;
he blesses the greedy and reviles the
Lord .
4In his pride the wicked does not seek
him; in all his thoughts there is no room
for God.
5His ways are always prosperous; he is
haughty and your laws are far from him;
he sneers at all his enemies.
6He says to himself, "Nothing will shake
me; I'll always be happy and never have
trouble."
7His mouth is full of curses and lies and
threats; trouble and evil are under his
tongue.
8He lies in wait near the villages; from
ambush he murders the innocent,
watching in secret for his victims.
9He lies in wait like a lion in cover; he
lies in wait to catch the helpless; he
catches the helpless and drags them off
in his net.
10His victims are crushed, they collapse;
they fall under his strength.
11He says to himself, "God has
forgotten; he covers his face and never
sees."
12Arise, Lord ! Lift up your hand, O God.
Do not forget the helpless.
13Why does the wicked man revile God?
Why does he say to himself, "He won't
call me to account"?
14But you, O God, do see trouble and
grief; you consider it to take it in hand.
The victim commits himself to you; you
are the helper of the fatherless.
15Break the arm of the wicked and evil
man; call him to account for his
wickedness that would not be found out.
16The Lord is King for ever and ever; the
nations will perish from his land.
17You hear, O Lord , the desire of the
afflicted; you encourage them, and you
listen to their cry,
18defending the fatherless and the
oppressed, in order that man, who is of
the earth, may terrify no more.
PSALM 11
1In the Lord I take refuge. How then can
you say to me: "Flee like a bird to your
mountain.
2For look, the wicked bend their bows;
they set their arrows against the strings
to shoot from the shadows at the upright
in heart.
3When the foundations are being
destroyed, what can the righteous do ?"
4The Lord is in his holy temple; the Lord
is on his heavenly throne. He observes
the sons of men; his eyes examine them.
5The Lord examines the righteous, but
the wicked and those who love violence
his soul hates.
6On the wicked he will rain fiery coals
and burning sulfur; a scorching wind will
be their lot.
7For the Lord is righteous, he loves
justice; upright men will see his face.
PSALM 12
1Help, Lord , for the godly are no more;
the faithful have vanished from among
men.
2Everyone lies to his neighbor; their
flattering lips speak with deception.
3May the Lord cut off all flattering lips
and every boastful tongue
4that says, "We will triumph with our
tongues; we own our lips -who is our
master?"
5"Because of the oppression of the weak
and the groaning of the needy, I will now
arise," says the Lord . "I will protect
them from those who malign them."
6And the words of the Lord are flawless,
like silver refined in a furnace of clay,
purified seven times.
7O Lord , you will keep us safe and
protect us from such people forever.
8The wicked freely strut about when
what is vile is honored among men.
PSALM 13
1How long, O Lord ? Will you forget me
forever? How long will you hide your
face from me?
2How long must I wrestle with my
thoughts and every day have sorrow in
my heart? How long will my enemy
triumph over me?
3Look on me and answer, O Lord my
God. Give light to my eyes, or I will
sleep in death;
4my enemy will say, "I have overcome
him," and my foes will rejoice when I fall.
5But I trust in your unfailing love; my
heart rejoices in your salvation.
6I will sing to the Lord , for he has been
good to me.
PSALM 14
1The fool says in his heart, "There is no
God." They are corrupt, their deeds are
vile; there is no one who does good.
2The Lord looks down from heaven on
the sons of men to see if there are any
who understand, any who seek God.
3All have turned aside, they have
together become corrupt; there is no
one who does good, not even one.
4Will evildoers never learn- those who
devour my people as men eat bread and
who do not call on the Lord ?
5There they are, overwhelmed with
dread, for God is present in the
company of the righteous.
6You evildoers frustrate the plans of the
poor, but the Lord is their refuge.
7Oh, that salvation for Israel would come
out of Zion! When the Lord restores the
fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice
and Israel be glad!
PSALM 15
1Lord , who may dwell in your
sanctuary? Who may live on your holy
hill?
2He whose walk is blameless and who
does what is righteous, who speaks the
truth from his heart
3and has no slander on his tongue, who
does his neighbor no wrong and casts
no slur on his fellowman,
4who despises a vile man but honors
those who fear the Lord , who keeps his
oath even when it hurts,
5who lends his money without usury and
does not accept a bribe against the
innocent. He who does these things will
never be shaken.
PSALM 16
1Keep me safe, O God, for in you I take
refuge.
2I said to the Lord , "You are my Lord;
apart from you I have no good thing."
3As for the saints who are in the land,
they are the glorious ones in whom is all
my delight.
4The sorrows of those will increase who
run after other gods. I will not pour out
their libations of blood or take up their
names on my lips.
5Lord , you have assigned me my
portion and my cup; you have made my
lot secure.
6The boundary lines have fallen for me
in pleasant places; surely I have a
delightful inheritance.
7I will praise the Lord , who counsels
me; even at night my heart instructs me.
8I have set the Lord always before me.
Because he is at my right hand, I will not
be shaken.
9Therefore my heart is glad and my
tongue rejoices; my body also will rest
secure,
10because you will not abandon me to
the grave, nor will you let your Holy One
see decay.
11You have made known to me the path
of life; you will fill me with joy in your
presence, with eternal pleasures at your
right hand.
PSALM 17
1Hear, O Lord , my righteous plea; listen
to my cry. Give ear to my prayer- it does
not rise from deceitful lips.
2May my vindication come from you;
may your eyes see what is right.
3Though you probe my heart and
examine me at night, though you test
me, you will find nothing; I have
resolved that my mouth will not sin.
4As for the deeds of men- by the word of
your lips I have kept myself from the
ways of the violent.
5My steps have held to your paths; my
feet have not slipped.
6I call on you, O God, for you will answer
me; give ear to me and hear my prayer.
7Show the wonder of your great love,
you who save by your right hand those
who take refuge in you from their foes.
8Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide
me in the shadow of your wings
9from the wicked who assail me, from
my mortal enemies who surround me.
10They close up their callous hearts, and
their mouths speak with arrogance.
11They have tracked me down, they now
surround me, with eyes alert, to throw
me to the ground.
12They are like a lion hungry for prey,
like a great lion crouching in cover.
13Rise up, O Lord , confront them, bring
them down; rescue me from the wicked
by your sword.
14O Lord , by your hand save me from
such men, from men of this world whose
reward is in this life. You still the hunger
of those you cherish; their sons have
plenty, and they store up wealth for their
children.
15And I-in righteousness I will see your
face; when I awake, I will be satisfied
with seeing your likeness.
PSALM 18
1I love you, O Lord , my strength.
2The Lord is my rock, my fortress and
my deliverer; my God is my rock, in
whom I take refuge. He is my shield and
the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
3I call to the Lord , who is worthy of
praise, and I am saved from my
enemies.
4The cords of death entangled me; the
torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.
5The cords of the grave coiled around
me; the snares of death confronted me.
6In my distress I called to the Lord ; I
cried to my God for help. From his
temple he heard my voice; my cry came
before him, into his ears.
7The earth trembled and quaked, and
the foundations of the mountains shook;
they trembled because he was angry.
8Smoke rose from his nostrils;
consuming fire came from his mouth,
burning coals blazed out of it.
9He parted the heavens and came
down; dark clouds were under his feet.
10He mounted the cherubim and flew; he
soared on the wings of the wind.
11He made darkness his covering, his
canopy around him- the dark rain clouds
of the sky.
12Out of the brightness of his presence
clouds advanced, with hailstones and
bolts of lightning.
13The Lord thundered from heaven; the
voice of the Most High resounded.
14He shot his arrows and scattered the
enemies , great bolts of lightning and
routed them.
15The valleys of the sea were exposed
and the foundations of the earth laid
bare at your rebuke, O Lord , at the
blast of breath from your nostrils.
16He reached down from on high and
took hold of me; he drew me out of deep
waters.
17He rescued me from my powerful
enemy, from my foes, who were too
strong for me.
18They confronted me in the day of my
disaster, but the Lord was my support.
19He brought me out into a spacious
place; he rescued me because he
delighted in me.
20The Lord has dealt with me according
to my righteousness; according to the
cleanness of my hands he has rewarded
me.
21For I have kept the ways of the Lord ; I
have not done evil by turning from my
God.
22All his laws are before me; I have not
turned away from his decrees.
23I have been blameless before him and
have kept myself from sin.
24The Lord has rewarded me according
to my righteousness, according to the
cleanness of my hands in his sight.
25To the faithful you show yourself
faithful, to the blameless you show
yourself blameless,
26to the pure you show yourself pure,
but to the crooked you show yourself
shrewd.
27You save the humble but bring low
those whose eyes are haughty.
28You, O Lord , keep my lamp burning;
my God turns my darkness into light.
29With your help I can advance against a
troop ; with my God I can scale a wall.
30As for God, his way is perfect; the
word of the Lord is flawless. He is a
shield for all who take refuge in him.
31For who is God besides the Lord ?
And who is the Rock except our God?
32It is God who arms me with strength
and makes my way perfect.
33He makes my feet like the feet of a
deer; he enables me to stand on the
heights.
34He trains my hands for battle; my arms
can bend a bow of bronze.
35You give me your shield of victory, and
your right hand sustains me; you stoop
down to make me great.
36You broaden the path beneath me, so
that my ankles do not turn.
37I pursued my enemies and overtook
them; I did not turn back till they were
destroyed.
38I crushed them so that they could not
rise; they fell beneath my feet.
39You armed me with strength for battle;
you made my adversaries bow at my
feet.
40You made my enemies turn their
backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes.
41They cried for help, but there was no
one to save them- to the Lord , but he
did not answer.
42I beat them as fine as dust borne on
the wind; I poured them out like mud in
the streets.
43You have delivered me from the
attacks of the people; you have made
me the head of nations; people I did not
know are subject to me.
44As soon as they hear me, they obey
me; foreigners cringe before me.
45They all lose heart; they come
trembling from their strongholds.
46The Lord lives! Praise be to my Rock!
Exalted be God my Savior!
47He is the God who avenges me, who
subdues nations under me,
48who saves me from my enemies. You
exalted me above my foes; from violent
men you rescued me.
49Therefore I will praise you among the
nations, O Lord ; I will sing praises to
your name.
50He gives his king great victories; he
shows unfailing kindness to his anointed,
to David and his descendants forever.
PSALM 19
1The heavens declare the glory of God;
the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
2Day after day they pour forth speech;
night after night they display knowledge.
3There is no speech or language where
their voice is not heard.
4Their voice goes out into all the earth,
their words to the ends of the world. In
the heavens he has pitched a tent for
the sun,
5which is like a bridegroom coming forth
from his pavilion, like a champion
rejoicing to run his course.
6It rises at one end of the heavens and
makes its circuit to the other; nothing is
hidden from its heat.
7The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving
the soul. The statutes of the Lord are
trustworthy, making wise the simple.
8The precepts of the Lord are right,
giving joy to the heart. The commands
of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the
eyes.
9The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring
forever. The ordinances of the Lord are
sure and altogether righteous.
10They are more precious than gold,
than much pure gold; they are sweeter
than honey, than honey from the comb.
11By them is your servant warned; in
keeping them there is great reward.
12Who can discern his errors? Forgive
my hidden faults.
13Keep your servant also from willful
sins; may they not rule over me. Then
will I be blameless, innocent of great
transgression.
14May the words of my mouth and the
meditation of my heart be pleasing in
your sight, O Lord , my Rock and my
Redeemer.
PSALM 20
1May the Lord answer you when you are
in distress; may the name of the God of
Jacob protect you.
2May he send you help from the
sanctuary and grant you support from
Zion.
3May he remember all your sacrifices
and accept your burnt offerings. Selah
4May he give you the desire of your
heart and make all your plans succeed.
5We will shout for joy when you are
victorious and will lift up our banners in
the name of our God. May the Lord
grant all your requests.
6Now I know that the Lord saves his
anointed; he answers him from his holy
heaven with the saving power of his
right hand.
7Some trust in chariots and some in
horses, but we trust in the name of the
Lord our God.
8They are brought to their knees and fall,
but we rise up and stand firm.
9O Lord , save the king! Answer us
when we call!
PSALM 21
1O Lord , the king rejoices in your
strength. How great is his joy in the
victories you give!
2You have granted him the desire of his
heart and have not withheld the request
of his lips. Selah
3You welcomed him with rich blessings
and placed a crown of pure gold on his
head.
4He asked you for life, and you gave it to
him- length of days, for ever and ever.
5Through the victories you gave, his
glory is great; you have bestowed on
him splendor and majesty.
6Surely you have granted him eternal
blessings and made him glad with the
joy of your presence.
7For the king trusts in the Lord ; through
the unfailing love of the Most High he
will not be shaken.
8Your hand will lay hold on all your
enemies; your right hand will seize your
foes.
9At the time of your appearing you will
make them like a fiery furnace. In his
wrath the Lord will swallow them up, and
his fire will consume them.
10You will destroy their descendants
from the earth, their posterity from
mankind.
11Though they plot evil against you and
devise wicked schemes, they cannot
succeed;
12for you will make them turn their backs
when you aim at them with drawn bow.
13Be exalted, O Lord , in your strength;
we will sing and praise your might.
PSALM 22
1My God, my God, why have you
forsaken me? Why are you so far from
saving me, so far from the words of my
groaning?
2O my God, I cry out by day, but you do
not answer, by night, and am not silent.
3Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One;
you are the praise of Israel.
4In you our fathers put their trust; they
trusted and you delivered them.
5They cried to you and were saved; in
you they trusted and were not
disappointed.
6But I am a worm and not a man,
scorned by men and despised by the
people.
7All who see me mock me; they hurl
insults, shaking their heads:
8"He trusts in the Lord ; let the Lord
rescue him. Let him deliver him, since
he delights in him."
9Yet you brought me out of the womb;
you made me trust in you even at my
mother's breast.
10From birth I was cast upon you; from
my mother's womb you have been my
God.
11Do not be far from me, for trouble is
near and there is no one to help.
12Many bulls surround me; strong bulls
of Bashan encircle me.
13Roaring lions tearing their prey open
their mouths wide against me.
14I am poured out like water, and all my
bones are out of joint. My heart has
turned to wax; it has melted away within
me.
15My strength is dried up like a potsherd,
and my tongue sticks to the roof of my
mouth; you lay me in the dust of death.
16Dogs have surrounded me; a band of
evil men has encircled me, they have
pierced my hands and my feet.
17I can count all my bones; people stare
and gloat over me.
18They divide my garments among them
and cast lots for my clothing.
19But you, O Lord , be not far off; O my
Strength, come quickly to help me.
20Deliver my life from the sword, my
precious life from the power of the dogs.
21Rescue me from the mouth of the
lions; save me from the horns of the wild
oxen.
22I will declare your name to my
brothers; in the congregation I will praise
you.
23You who fear the Lord , praise him! All
you descendants of Jacob, honor him!
Revere him, all you descendants of
Israel!
24For he has not despised or disdained
the suffering of the afflicted one; he has
not hidden his face from him but has
listened to his cry for help.
25From you comes the theme of my
praise in the great assembly; before
those who fear you will I fulfill my vows.
26The poor will eat and be satisfied; they
who seek the Lord will praise him- may
your hearts live forever!
27All the ends of the earth will remember
and turn to the Lord , and all the families
of the nations will bow down before him,
28for dominion belongs to the Lord and
he rules over the nations.
29All the rich of the earth will feast and
worship; all who go down to the dust will
kneel before him- those who cannot
keep themselves alive.
30Posterity will serve him; future
generations will be told about the Lord.
31They will proclaim his righteousness to
a people yet unborn- for he has done it.
PSALM 23
1The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not be
in want.
2He makes me lie down in green
pastures, he leads me beside quiet
waters,
3he restores my soul. He guides me in
paths of righteousness for his name's
sake.
4Even though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil,
for you are with me; your rod and your
staff, they comfort me.
5You prepare a table before me in the
presence of my enemies. You anoint my
head with oil; my cup overflows.
6Surely goodness and love will follow
me all the days of my life, and I will
dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
PSALM 24
1The earth is the Lord 's, and everything
in it, the world, and all who live in it;
2for he founded it upon the seas and
established it upon the waters.
3Who may ascend the hill of the Lord ?
Who may stand in his holy place?
4He who has clean hands and a pure
heart, who does not lift up his soul to an
idol or swear by what is false.
5He will receive blessing from the Lord
and vindication from God his Savior.
6Such is the generation of those who
seek him, who seek your face, O God of
Jacob. Selah
7Lift up your heads, O you gates; be
lifted up, you ancient doors, that the
King of glory may come in.
8Who is this King of glory? The Lord
strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in
battle.
9Lift up your heads, O you gates; lift
them up, you ancient doors, that the
King of glory may come in.
10Who is he, this King of glory? The Lord
Almighty- he is the King of glory. Selah
PSALM 25
1To you, O Lord , I lift up my soul;
2in you I trust, O my God. Do not let me
be put to shame, nor let my enemies
triumph over me.
3No one whose hope is in you will ever
be put to shame, but they will be put to
shame who are treacherous without
excuse.
4Show me your ways, O Lord , teach me
your paths;
5guide me in your truth and teach me,
for you are God my Savior, and my
hope is in you all day long.
6Remember, O Lord , your great mercy
and love, for they are from of old.
7Remember not the sins of my youth
and my rebellious ways; according to
your love remember me, for you are
good, O Lord .
8Good and upright is the Lord ; therefore
he instructs sinners in his ways.
9He guides the humble in what is right
and teaches them his way.
10All the ways of the Lord are loving and
faithful for those who keep the demands
of his covenant.
11For the sake of your name, O Lord ,
forgive my iniquity, though it is great.
12Who, then, is the man that fears the
Lord ? He will instruct him in the way
chosen for him.
13He will spend his days in prosperity,
and his descendants will inherit the land.
14The Lord confides in those who fear
him; he makes his covenant known to
them.
15My eyes are ever on the Lord , for only
he will release my feet from the snare.
16Turn to me and be gracious to me, for
I am lonely and afflicted.
17The troubles of my heart have
multiplied; free me from my anguish.
18Look upon my affliction and my
distress and take away all my sins.
19See how my enemies have increased
and how fiercely they hate me!
20Guard my life and rescue me; let me
not be put to shame, for I take refuge in
you.
21May integrity and uprightness protect
me, because my hope is in you.
22Redeem Israel, O God, from all their
troubles!
PSALM 26
1Vindicate me, O Lord , for I have led a
blameless life; I have trusted in the Lord
without wavering.
2Test me, O Lord , and try me, examine
my heart and my mind;
3for your love is ever before me, and I
walk continually in your truth.
4I do not sit with deceitful men, nor do I
consort with hypocrites;
5I abhor the assembly of evildoers and
refuse to sit with the wicked.
6I wash my hands in innocence, and go
about your altar, O Lord ,
7proclaiming aloud your praise and
telling of all your wonderful deeds.
8I love the house where you live, O Lord ,
the place where your glory dwells.
9Do not take away my soul along with
sinners, my life with bloodthirsty men,
10in whose hands are wicked schemes,
whose right hands are full of bribes.
11But I lead a blameless life; redeem me
and be merciful to me.
12My feet stand on level ground; in the
great assembly I will praise the Lord .
PSALM 27
1The Lord is my light and my salvationwhom
shall I fear? The Lord is the
stronghold of my life- of whom shall I be
afraid?
2When evil men advance against me to
devour my flesh, when my enemies and
my foes attack me, they will stumble and
fall.
3Though an army besiege me, my heart
will not fear; though war break out
against me, even then will I be confident.
4One thing I ask of the Lord , this is what
I seek: that I may dwell in the house of
the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze
upon the beauty of the Lord and to seek
him in his temple.
5For in the day of trouble he will keep
me safe in his dwelling; he will hide me
in the shelter of his tabernacle and set
me high upon a rock.
6Then my head will be exalted above the
enemies who surround me; at his
tabernacle will I sacrifice with shouts of
joy; I will sing and make music to the
Lord .
7Hear my voice when I call, O Lord ; be
merciful to me and answer me.
8My heart says of you, "Seek his face!"
Your face, Lord , I will seek.
9Do not hide your face from me, do not
turn your servant away in anger; you
have been my helper. Do not reject me
or forsake me, O God my Savior.
10Though my father and mother forsake
me, the Lord will receive me.
11Teach me your way, O Lord ; lead me
in a straight path because of my
oppressors.
12Do not turn me over to the desire of
my foes, for false witnesses rise up
against me, breathing out violence.
13I am still confident of this: I will see the
goodness of the Lord in the land of the
living.
14Wait for the Lord ; be strong and take
heart and wait for the Lord .
PSALM 28
1To you I call, O Lord my Rock; do not
turn a deaf ear to me. For if you remain
silent, I will be like those who have gone
down to the pit.
2Hear my cry for mercy as I call to you
for help, as I lift up my hands toward
your Most Holy Place.
3Do not drag me away with the wicked,
with those who do evil, who speak
cordially with their neighbors but harbor
malice in their hearts.
4Repay them for their deeds and for
their evil work; repay them for what their
hands have done and bring back upon
them what they deserve.
5Since they show no regard for the
works of the Lord and what his hands
have done, he will tear them down and
never build them up again.
6Praise be to the Lord , for he has heard
my cry for mercy.
7The Lord is my strength and my shield;
my heart trusts in him, and I am helped.
My heart leaps for joy and I will give
thanks to him in song.
8The Lord is the strength of his people, a
fortress of salvation for his anointed one.
9Save your people and bless your
inheritance; be their shepherd and carry
them forever.
PSALM 29
1Ascribe to the Lord , O mighty ones,
ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
2Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his
name; worship the Lord in the splendor
of his holiness.
3The voice of the Lord is over the
waters; the God of glory thunders, the
Lord thunders over the mighty waters.
4The voice of the Lord is powerful; the
voice of the Lord is majestic.
5The voice of the Lord breaks the
cedars; the Lord breaks in pieces the
cedars of Lebanon.
6He makes Lebanon skip like a calf,
Sirion like a young wild ox.
7The voice of the Lord strikes with
flashes of lightning.
8The voice of the Lord shakes the
desert; the Lord shakes the Desert of
Kadesh.
9The voice of the Lord twists the oaks
and strips the forests bare. And in his
temple all cry, "Glory!"
10The Lord sits enthroned over the flood;
the Lord is enthroned as King forever.
11The Lord gives strength to his people;
the Lord blesses his people with peace.
PSALM 30
1I will exalt you, O Lord , for you lifted
me out of the depths and did not let my
enemies gloat over me.
2O Lord my God, I called to you for help
and you healed me.
3O Lord , you brought me up from the
grave ; you spared me from going down
into the pit.
4Sing to the Lord , you saints of his;
praise his holy name.
5For his anger lasts only a moment, but
his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may
remain for a night, but rejoicing comes
in the morning.
6When I felt secure, I said, "I will never
be shaken."
7O Lord , when you favored me, you
made my mountain stand firm; but when
you hid your face, I was dismayed.
8To you, O Lord , I called; to the Lord I
cried for mercy:
9"What gain is there in my destruction, in
my going down into the pit? Will the dust
praise you? Will it proclaim your
faithfulness?
10Hear, O Lord , and be merciful to me;
O Lord , be my help."
11You turned my wailing into dancing;
you removed my sackcloth and clothed
me with joy,
12that my heart may sing to you and not
be silent. O Lord my God, I will give you
thanks forever.
PSALM 31
1In you, O Lord , I have taken refuge; let
me never be put to shame; deliver me in
your righteousness.
2Turn your ear to me, come quickly to
my rescue; be my rock of refuge, a
strong fortress to save me.
3Since you are my rock and my fortress,
for the sake of your name lead and
guide me.
4Free me from the trap that is set for me,
for you are my refuge.
5Into your hands I commit my spirit;
redeem me, O Lord , the God of truth.
6I hate those who cling to worthless
idols; I trust in the Lord .
7I will be glad and rejoice in your love,
for you saw my affliction and knew the
anguish of my soul.
8You have not handed me over to the
enemy but have set my feet in a
spacious place.
9Be merciful to me, O Lord , for I am in
distress; my eyes grow weak with
sorrow, my soul and my body with grief.
10My life is consumed by anguish and
my years by groaning; my strength fails
because of my affliction, and my bones
grow weak.
11Because of all my enemies, I am the
utter contempt of my neighbors; I am a
dread to my friends- those who see me
on the street flee from me.
12I am forgotten by them as though I
were dead; I have become like broken
pottery.
13For I hear the slander of many; there is
terror on every side; they conspire
against me and plot to take my life.
14But I trust in you, O Lord ; I say, "You
are my God."
15My times are in your hands; deliver me
from my enemies and from those who
pursue me.
16Let your face shine on your servant;
save me in your unfailing love.
17Let me not be put to shame, O Lord ,
for I have cried out to you; but let the
wicked be put to shame and lie silent in
the grave.
18Let their lying lips be silenced, for with
pride and contempt they speak
arrogantly against the righteous.
19How great is your goodness, which
you have stored up for those who fear
you, which you bestow in the sight of
men on those who take refuge in you.
20In the shelter of your presence you
hide them from the intrigues of men; in
your dwelling you keep them safe from
accusing tongues.
21Praise be to the Lord , for he showed
his wonderful love to me when I was in a
besieged city.
22In my alarm I said, "I am cut off from
your sight!" Yet you heard my cry for
mercy when I called to you for help.
23Love the Lord , all his saints! The Lord
preserves the faithful, but the proud he
pays back in full.
24Be strong and take heart, all you who
hope in the Lord .
PSALM 32
1Blessed is he whose transgressions are
forgiven, whose sins are covered.
2Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord
does not count against him and in
whose spirit is no deceit.
3When I kept silent, my bones wasted
away through my groaning all day long.
4For day and night your hand was heavy
upon me; my strength was sapped as in
the heat of summer. Selah
5Then I acknowledged my sin to you and
did not cover up my iniquity. I said, "I will
confess my transgressions to the Lord "-
and you forgave the guilt of my sin.
Selah
6Therefore let everyone who is godly
pray to you while you may be found;
surely when the mighty waters rise, they
will not reach him.
7You are my hiding place; you will
protect me from trouble and surround
me with songs of deliverance. Selah
8I will instruct you and teach you in the
way you should go; I will counsel you
and watch over you.
9Do not be like the horse or the mule,
which have no understanding but must
be controlled by bit and bridle or they
will not come to you.
10Many are the woes of the wicked, but
the Lord 's unfailing love surrounds the
man who trusts in him.
11Rejoice in the Lord and be glad, you
righteous; sing, all you who are upright
in heart!
PSALM 33
1Sing joyfully to the Lord , you righteous;
it is fitting for the upright to praise him.
2Praise the Lord with the harp; make
music to him on the ten-stringed lyre.
3Sing to him a new song; play skillfully,
and shout for joy.
4For the word of the Lord is right and
true; he is faithful in all he does.
5The Lord loves righteousness and
justice; the earth is full of his unfailing
love.
6By the word of the Lord were the
heavens made, their starry host by the
breath of his mouth.
7He gathers the waters of the sea into
jars ; he puts the deep into storehouses.
8Let all the earth fear the Lord ; let all
the people of the world revere him.
9For he spoke, and it came to be; he
commanded, and it stood firm.
10The Lord foils the plans of the nations;
he thwarts the purposes of the peoples.
11But the plans of the Lord stand firm
forever, the purposes of his heart
through all generations.
12Blessed is the nation whose God is the
Lord , the people he chose for his
inheritance.
13From heaven the Lord looks down and
sees all mankind;
14from his dwelling place he watches all
who live on earth-
15he who forms the hearts of all, who
considers everything they do.
16No king is saved by the size of his
army; no warrior escapes by his great
strength.
17A horse is a vain hope for deliverance;
despite all its great strength it cannot
save.
18But the eyes of the Lord are on those
who fear him, on those whose hope is in
his unfailing love,
19to deliver them from death and keep
them alive in famine.
20We wait in hope for the Lord ; he is our
help and our shield.
21In him our hearts rejoice, for we trust
in his holy name.
22May your unfailing love rest upon us,
O Lord , even as we put our hope in you.
PSALM 34
1I will extol the Lord at all times; his
praise will always be on my lips.
2My soul will boast in the Lord ; let the
afflicted hear and rejoice.
3Glorify the Lord with me; let us exalt his
name together.
4I sought the Lord , and he answered
me; he delivered me from all my fears.
5Those who look to him are radiant; their
faces are never covered with shame.
6This poor man called, and the Lord
heard him; he saved him out of all his
troubles.
7The angel of the Lord encamps around
those who fear him, and he delivers
them.
8Taste and see that the Lord is good;
blessed is the man who takes refuge in
him.
9Fear the Lord , you his saints, for those
who fear him lack nothing.
10The lions may grow weak and hungry,
but those who seek the Lord lack no
good thing.
11Come, my children, listen to me; I will
teach you the fear of the Lord .
12Whoever of you loves life and desires
to see many good days,
13keep your tongue from evil and your
lips from speaking lies.
14Turn from evil and do good; seek
peace and pursue it.
15The eyes of the Lord are on the
righteous and his ears are attentive to
their cry;
16the face of the Lord is against those
who do evil, to cut off the memory of
them from the earth.
17The righteous cry out, and the Lord
hears them; he delivers them from all
their troubles.
18The Lord is close to the brokenhearted
and saves those who are crushed in
spirit.
19A righteous man may have many
troubles, but the Lord delivers him from
them all;
20he protects all his bones, not one of
them will be broken.
21Evil will slay the wicked; the foes of the
righteous will be condemned.
22The Lord redeems his servants; no
one will be condemned who takes
refuge in him.
PSALM 35
1Contend, O Lord , with those who
contend with me; fight against those
who fight against me.
2Take up shield and buckler; arise and
come to my aid.
3Brandish spear and javelin against
those who pursue me. Say to my soul, "I
am your salvation."
4May those who seek my life be
disgraced and put to shame; may those
who plot my ruin be turned back in
dismay.
5May they be like chaff before the wind,
with the angel of the Lord driving them
away;
6may their path be dark and slippery,
with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.
7Since they hid their net for me without
cause and without cause dug a pit for
me,
8may ruin overtake them by surprisemay
the net they hid entangle them,
may they fall into the pit, to their ruin.
9Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord
and delight in his salvation.
10My whole being will exclaim, "Who is
like you, O Lord ? You rescue the poor
from those too strong for them, the poor
and needy from those who rob them."
11Ruthless witnesses come forward;
they question me on things I know
nothing about.
12They repay me evil for good and leave
my soul forlorn.
13Yet when they were ill, I put on
sackcloth and humbled myself with
fasting. When my prayers returned to
me unanswered,
14I went about mourning as though for
my friend or brother. I bowed my head in
grief as though weeping for my mother.
15But when I stumbled, they gathered in
glee; attackers gathered against me
when I was unaware. They slandered
me without ceasing.
16Like the ungodly they maliciously
mocked ; they gnashed their teeth at me.
17O Lord, how long will you look on?
Rescue my life from their ravages, my
precious life from these lions.
18I will give you thanks in the great
assembly; among throngs of people I
will praise you.
19Let not those gloat over me who are
my enemies without cause; let not those
who hate me without reason maliciously
wink the eye.
20They do not speak peaceably, but
devise false accusations against those
who live quietly in the land.
21They gape at me and say, "Aha! Aha!
With our own eyes we have seen it."
22O Lord , you have seen this; be not
silent. Do not be far from me, O Lord.
23Awake, and rise to my defense!
Contend for me, my God and Lord.
24Vindicate me in your righteousness, O
Lord my God; do not let them gloat over
me.
25Do not let them think, "Aha, just what
we wanted!" or say, "We have
swallowed him up."
26May all who gloat over my distress be
put to shame and confusion; may all
who exalt themselves over me be
clothed with shame and disgrace.
27May those who delight in my
vindication shout for joy and gladness;
may they always say, "The Lord be
exalted, who delights in the well-being of
his servant."
28My tongue will speak of your
righteousness and of your praises all
day long.
PSALM 36
1An oracle is within my heart concerning
the sinfulness of the wicked: There is no
fear of God before his eyes.
2For in his own eyes he flatters himself
too much to detect or hate his sin.
3The words of his mouth are wicked and
deceitful; he has ceased to be wise and
to do good.
4Even on his bed he plots evil; he
commits himself to a sinful course and
does not reject what is wrong.
5Your love, O Lord , reaches to the
heavens, your faithfulness to the skies.
6Your righteousness is like the mighty
mountains, your justice like the great
deep. O Lord , you preserve both man
and beast.
7How priceless is your unfailing love!
Both high and low among men find
refuge in the shadow of your wings.
8They feast on the abundance of your
house; you give them drink from your
river of delights.
9For with you is the fountain of life; in
your light we see light.
10Continue your love to those who know
you, your righteousness to the upright in
heart.
11May the foot of the proud not come
against me, nor the hand of the wicked
drive me away.
12See how the evildoers lie fallenthrown
down, not able to rise!
PSALM 37
1Do not fret because of evil men or be
envious of those who do wrong;
2for like the grass they will soon wither,
like green plants they will soon die away.
3Trust in the Lord and do good; dwell in
the land and enjoy safe pasture.
4Delight yourself in the Lord and he will
give you the desires of your heart.
5Commit your way to the Lord ; trust in
him and he will do this:
6He will make your righteousness shine
like the dawn, the justice of your cause
like the noonday sun.
7Be still before the Lord and wait
patiently for him; do not fret when men
succeed in their ways, when they carry
out their wicked schemes.
8Refrain from anger and turn from wrath;
do not fret-it leads only to evil.
9For evil men will be cut off, but those
who hope in the Lord will inherit the land.
10A little while, and the wicked will be no
more; though you look for them, they will
not be found.
11But the meek will inherit the land and
enjoy great peace.
12The wicked plot against the righteous
and gnash their teeth at them;
13but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for
he knows their day is coming.
14The wicked draw the sword and bend
the bow to bring down the poor and
needy, to slay those whose ways are
upright.
15But their swords will pierce their own
hearts, and their bows will be broken.
16Better the little that the righteous have
than the wealth of many wicked;
17for the power of the wicked will be
broken, but the Lord upholds the
righteous.
18The days of the blameless are known
to the Lord , and their inheritance will
endure forever.
19In times of disaster they will not wither;
in days of famine they will enjoy plenty.
20But the wicked will perish: The Lord 's
enemies will be like the beauty of the
fields, they will vanish-vanish like smoke.
21The wicked borrow and do not repay,
but the righteous give generously;
22those the Lord blesses will inherit the
land, but those he curses will be cut off.
23If the Lord delights in a man's way, he
makes his steps firm;
24though he stumble, he will not fall, for
the Lord upholds him with his hand.
25I was young and now I am old, yet I
have never seen the righteous forsaken
or their children begging bread.
26They are always generous and lend
freely; their children will be blessed.
27Turn from evil and do good; then you
will dwell in the land forever.
28For the Lord loves the just and will not
forsake his faithful ones. They will be
protected forever, but the offspring of
the wicked will be cut off;
29the righteous will inherit the land and
dwell in it forever.
30The mouth of the righteous man utters
wisdom, and his tongue speaks what is
just.
31The law of his God is in his heart; his
feet do not slip.
32The wicked lie in wait for the righteous,
seeking their very lives;
33but the Lord will not leave them in their
power or let them be condemned when
brought to trial.
34Wait for the Lord and keep his way. He
will exalt you to inherit the land; when
the wicked are cut off, you will see it.
35I have seen a wicked and ruthless
man flourishing like a green tree in its
native soil,
36but he soon passed away and was no
more; though I looked for him, he could
not be found.
37Consider the blameless, observe the
upright; there is a future for the man of
peace.
38But all sinners will be destroyed; the
future of the wicked will be cut off.
39The salvation of the righteous comes
from the Lord ; he is their stronghold in
time of trouble.
40The Lord helps them and delivers
them; he delivers them from the wicked
and saves them, because they take
refuge in him.
PSALM 38
1O Lord , do not rebuke me in your
anger or discipline me in your wrath.
2For your arrows have pierced me, and
your hand has come down upon me.
3Because of your wrath there is no
health in my body; my bones have no
soundness because of my sin.
4My guilt has overwhelmed me like a
burden too heavy to bear.
5My wounds fester and are loathsome
because of my sinful folly.
6I am bowed down and brought very
low; all day long I go about mourning.
7My back is filled with searing pain;
there is no health in my body.
8I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan
in anguish of heart.
9All my longings lie open before you, O
Lord; my sighing is not hidden from you.
10My heart pounds, my strength fails me;
even the light has gone from my eyes.
11My friends and companions avoid me
because of my wounds; my neighbors
stay far away.
12Those who seek my life set their traps,
those who would harm me talk of my
ruin; all day long they plot deception.
13I am like a deaf man, who cannot hear,
like a mute, who cannot open his mouth;
14I have become like a man who does
not hear, whose mouth can offer no
reply.
15I wait for you, O Lord ; you will answer,
O Lord my God.
16For I said, "Do not let them gloat or
exalt themselves over me when my foot
slips."
17For I am about to fall, and my pain is
ever with me.
18I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by
my sin.
19Many are those who are my vigorous
enemies; those who hate me without
reason are numerous.
20Those who repay my good with evil
slander me when I pursue what is good.
21O Lord , do not forsake me; be not far
from me, O my God.
22Come quickly to help me, O Lord my
Savior.
PSALM 39
1I said, "I will watch my ways and keep
my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle
on my mouth as long as the wicked are
in my presence."
2But when I was silent and still, not even
saying anything good, my anguish
increased.
3My heart grew hot within me, and as I
meditated, the fire burned; then I spoke
with my tongue:
4"Show me, O Lord , my life's end and
the number of my days; let me know
how fleeting is my life.
5You have made my days a mere
handbreadth; the span of my years is as
nothing before you. Each man's life is
but a breath. Selah
6Man is a mere phantom as he goes to
and fro: He bustles about, but only in
vain; he heaps up wealth, not knowing
who will get it.
7"But now, Lord, what do I look for? My
hope is in you.
8Save me from all my transgressions; do
not make me the scorn of fools.
9I was silent; I would not open my mouth,
for you are the one who has done this.
10Remove your scourge from me; I am
overcome by the blow of your hand.
11You rebuke and discipline men for
their sin; you consume their wealth like
a moth- each man is but a breath. Selah
12"Hear my prayer, O Lord , listen to my
cry for help; be not deaf to my weeping.
For I dwell with you as an alien, a
stranger, as all my fathers were.
13Look away from me, that I may rejoice
again before I depart and am no more."
PSALM 40
1I waited patiently for the Lord ; he
turned to me and heard my cry.
2He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of
the mud and mire; he set my feet on a
rock and gave me a firm place to stand.
3He put a new song in my mouth, a
hymn of praise to our God. Many will
see and fear and put their trust in the
Lord .
4Blessed is the man who makes the
Lord his trust, who does not look to the
proud, to those who turn aside to false
gods.
5Many, O Lord my God, are the wonders
you have done. The things you planned
for us no one can recount to you; were I
to speak and tell of them, they would be
too many to declare.
6Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,
but my ears you have pierced , ; burnt
offerings and sin offerings you did not
require.
7Then I said, "Here I am, I have come- it
is written about me in the scroll.
8I desire to do your will, O my God; your
law is within my heart."
9I proclaim righteousness in the great
assembly; I do not seal my lips, as you
know, O Lord .
10I do not hide your righteousness in my
heart; I speak of your faithfulness and
salvation. I do not conceal your love and
your truth from the great assembly.
11Do not withhold your mercy from me,
O Lord ; may your love and your truth
always protect me.
12For troubles without number surround
me; my sins have overtaken me, and I
cannot see. They are more than the
hairs of my head, and my heart fails
within me.
13Be pleased, O Lord , to save me; O
Lord , come quickly to help me.
14May all who seek to take my life be put
to shame and confusion; may all who
desire my ruin be turned back in
disgrace.
15May those who say to me, "Aha! Aha!"
be appalled at their own shame.
16But may all who seek you rejoice and
be glad in you; may those who love your
salvation always say, "The Lord be
exalted!"
17Yet I am poor and needy; may the
Lord think of me. You are my help and
my deliverer; O my God, do not delay.
PSALM 41
1Blessed is he who has regard for the
weak; the Lord delivers him in times of
trouble.
2The Lord will protect him and preserve
his life; he will bless him in the land and
not surrender him to the desire of his
foes.
3The Lord will sustain him on his sickbed
and restore him from his bed of illness.
4I said, "O Lord , have mercy on me;
heal me, for I have sinned against you."
5My enemies say of me in malice,
"When will he die and his name perish?"
6Whenever one comes to see me, he
speaks falsely, while his heart gathers
slander; then he goes out and spreads it
abroad.
7All my enemies whisper together
against me; they imagine the worst for
me, saying,
8"A vile disease has beset him; he will
never get up from the place where he
lies."
9Even my close friend, whom I trusted,
he who shared my bread, has lifted up
his heel against me.
10But you, O Lord , have mercy on me;
raise me up, that I may repay them.
11I know that you are pleased with me,
for my enemy does not triumph over me.
12In my integrity you uphold me and set
me in your presence forever.
13Praise be to the Lord , the God of
Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.
Amen and Amen.
PSALM 42
1As the deer pants for streams of water,
so my soul pants for you, O God.
2My soul thirsts for God, for the living
God. When can I go and meet with
God?
3My tears have been my food day and
night, while men say to me all day long,
"Where is your God?"
4These things I remember as I pour out
my soul: how I used to go with the
multitude, leading the procession to the
house of God, with shouts of joy and
thanksgiving among the festive throng.
5Why are you downcast, O my soul?
Why so disturbed within me? Put your
hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my
Savior and
6my God. My soul is downcast within
me; therefore I will remember you from
the land of the Jordan, the heights of
Hermon-from Mount Mizar.
7Deep calls to deep in the roar of your
waterfalls; all your waves and breakers
have swept over me.
8By day the Lord directs his love, at
night his song is with me- a prayer to the
God of my life.
9I say to God my Rock, "Why have you
forgotten me? Why must I go about
mourning, oppressed by the enemy?"
10My bones suffer mortal agony as my
foes taunt me, saying to me all day long,
"Where is your God?"
11Why are you downcast, O my soul?
Why so disturbed within me? Put your
hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my
Savior and my God.
PSALM 43
1Vindicate me, O God, and plead my
cause against an ungodly nation; rescue
me from deceitful and wicked men.
2You are God my stronghold. Why have
you rejected me? Why must I go about
mourning, oppressed by the enemy?
3Send forth your light and your truth, let
them guide me; let them bring me to
your holy mountain, to the place where
you dwell.
4Then will I go to the altar of God, to
God, my joy and my delight. I will praise
you with the harp, O God, my God.
5Why are you downcast, O my soul?
Why so disturbed within me? Put your
hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my
Savior and my God.
PSALM 44
1We have heard with our ears, O God;
our fathers have told us what you did in
their days, in days long ago.
2With your hand you drove out the
nations and planted our fathers; you
crushed the peoples and made our
fathers flourish.
3It was not by their sword that they won
the land, nor did their arm bring them
victory; it was your right hand, your arm,
and the light of your face, for you loved
them.
4You are my King and my God, who
decrees victories for Jacob.
5Through you we push back our
enemies; through your name we trample
our foes.
6I do not trust in my bow, my sword does
not bring me victory;
7but you give us victory over our
enemies, you put our adversaries to
shame.
8In God we make our boast all day long,
and we will praise your name forever.
Selah
9But now you have rejected and
humbled us; you no longer go out with
our armies.
10You made us retreat before the enemy,
and our adversaries have plundered us.
11You gave us up to be devoured like
sheep and have scattered us among the
nations.
12You sold your people for a pittance,
gaining nothing from their sale.
13You have made us a reproach to our
neighbors, the scorn and derision of
those around us.
14You have made us a byword among
the nations; the peoples shake their
heads at us.
15My disgrace is before me all day long,
and my face is covered with shame
16at the taunts of those who reproach
and revile me, because of the enemy,
who is bent on revenge.
17All this happened to us, though we had
not forgotten you or been false to your
covenant.
18Our hearts had not turned back; our
feet had not strayed from your path.
19But you crushed us and made us a
haunt for jackals and covered us over
with deep darkness.
20If we had forgotten the name of our
God or spread out our hands to a
foreign god,
21would not God have discovered it,
since he knows the secrets of the heart?
22Yet for your sake we face death all day
long; we are considered as sheep to be
slaughtered.
23Awake, O Lord! Why do you sleep?
Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.
24Why do you hide your face and forget
our misery and oppression?
25We are brought down to the dust; our
bodies cling to the ground.
26Rise up and help us; redeem us
because of your unfailing love.
PSALM 45
1My heart is stirred by a noble theme as
I recite my verses for the king; my
tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.
2You are the most excellent of men and
your lips have been anointed with grace,
since God has blessed you forever.
3Gird your sword upon your side, O
mighty one; clothe yourself with
splendor and majesty.
4In your majesty ride forth victoriously in
behalf of truth, humility and
righteousness; let your right hand
display awesome deeds.
5Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts
of the king's enemies; let the nations fall
beneath your feet.
6Your throne, O God, will last for ever
and ever; a scepter of justice will be the
scepter of your kingdom.
7You love righteousness and hate
wickedness; therefore God, your God,
has set you above your companions by
anointing you with the oil of joy.
8All your robes are fragrant with myrrh
and aloes and cassia; from palaces
adorned with ivory the music of the
strings makes you glad.
9Daughters of kings are among your
honored women; at your right hand is
the royal bride in gold of Ophir.
10Listen, O daughter, consider and give
ear: Forget your people and your
father's house.
11The king is enthralled by your beauty;
honor him, for he is your lord.
12The Daughter of Tyre will come with a
gift, men of wealth will seek your favor.
13All glorious is the princess within her
chamber ; her gown is interwoven with
gold.
14In embroidered garments she is led to
the king; her virgin companions follow
her and are brought to you.
15They are led in with joy and gladness;
they enter the palace of the king.
16Your sons will take the place of your
fathers; you will make them princes
throughout the land.
17I will perpetuate your memory through
all generations; therefore the nations will
praise you for ever and ever.
PSALM 46
1God is our refuge and strength, an
ever-present help in trouble.
2Therefore we will not fear, though the
earth give way and the mountains fall
into the heart of the sea,
3though its waters roar and foam and
the mountains quake with their surging.
Selah
4There is a river whose streams make
glad the city of God, the holy place
where the Most High dwells.
5God is within her, she will not fall; God
will help her at break of day.
6Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he
lifts his voice, the earth melts.
7The Lord Almighty is with us; the God
of Jacob is our fortress. Selah
8Come and see the works of the Lord ,
the desolations he has brought on the
earth.
9He makes wars cease to the ends of
the earth; he breaks the bow and
shatters the spear, he burns the shields
with fire.
10"Be still, and know that I am God; I will
be exalted among the nations, I will be
exalted in the earth."
11The Lord Almighty is with us; the God
of Jacob is our fortress. Selah
PSALM 47
1Clap your hands, all you nations; shout
to God with cries of joy.
2How awesome is the Lord Most High,
the great King over all the earth!
3He subdued nations under us, peoples
under our feet.
4He chose our inheritance for us, the
pride of Jacob, whom he loved. Selah
5God has ascended amid shouts of joy,
the Lord amid the sounding of trumpets.
6Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing
praises to our King, sing praises.
7For God is the King of all the earth; sing
to him a psalm of praise.
8God reigns over the nations; God is
seated on his holy throne.
9The nobles of the nations assemble as
the people of the God of Abraham, for
the kings of the earth belong to God; he
is greatly exalted.
PSALM 48
1Great is the Lord , and most worthy of
praise, in the city of our God, his holy
mountain.
2It is beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of
the whole earth. Like the utmost heights
of Zaphon is Mount Zion, the city of the
Great King.
3God is in her citadels; he has shown
himself to be her fortress.
4When the kings joined forces, when
they advanced together,
5they saw her and were astounded; they
fled in terror.
6Trembling seized them there, pain like
that of a woman in labor.
7You destroyed them like ships of
Tarshish shattered by an east wind.
8As we have heard, so have we seen in
the city of the Lord Almighty, in the city
of our God: God makes her secure
forever. Selah
9Within your temple, O God, we
meditate on your unfailing love.
10Like your name, O God, your praise
reaches to the ends of the earth; your
right hand is filled with righteousness.
11Mount Zion rejoices, the villages of
Judah are glad because of your
judgments.
12Walk about Zion, go around her, count
her towers,
13consider well her ramparts, view her
citadels, that you may tell of them to the
next generation.
14For this God is our God for ever and
ever; he will be our guide even to the
end.
PSALM 49
1Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all
who live in this world,
2both low and high, rich and poor alike:
3My mouth will speak words of wisdom;
the utterance from my heart will give
understanding.
4I will turn my ear to a proverb; with the
harp I will expound my riddle:
5Why should I fear when evil days come,
when wicked deceivers surround me-
6those who trust in their wealth and
boast of their great riches?
7No man can redeem the life of another
or give to God a ransom for him8the
ransom for a life is costly, no
payment is ever enough-
9that he should live on forever and not
see decay.
10For all can see that wise men die; the
foolish and the senseless alike perish
and leave their wealth to others.
11Their tombs will remain their houses
forever, their dwellings for endless
generations, though they had named
lands after themselves.
12But man, despite his riches, does not
endure; he is like the beasts that perish.
13This is the fate of those who trust in
themselves, and of their followers, who
approve their sayings. Selah
14Like sheep they are destined for the
grave, and death will feed on them. The
upright will rule over them in the
morning; their forms will decay in the
grave, far from their princely mansions.
15But God will redeem my life from the
grave; he will surely take me to himself.
Selah
16Do not be overawed when a man
grows rich, when the splendor of his
house increases;
17for he will take nothing with him when
he dies, his splendor will not descend
with him.
18Though while he lived he counted
himself blessed- and men praise you
when you prosper-
19he will join the generation of his
fathers, who will never see the light of
life .
20A man who has riches without
understanding is like the beasts that
perish.
PSALM 50
1The Mighty One, God, the Lord ,
speaks and summons the earth from the
rising of the sun to the place where it
sets.
2From Zion, perfect in beauty, God
shines forth.
3Our God comes and will not be silent; a
fire devours before him, and around him
a tempest rages.
4He summons the heavens above, and
the earth, that he may judge his people:
5"Gather to me my consecrated ones,
who made a covenant with me by
sacrifice."
6And the heavens proclaim his
righteousness, for God himself is judge.
Selah
7"Hear, O my people, and I will speak, O
Israel, and I will testify against you: I am
God, your God.
8I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices
or your burnt offerings, which are ever
before me.
9I have no need of a bull from your stall
or of goats from your pens,
10for every animal of the forest is mine,
and the cattle on a thousand hills.
11I know every bird in the mountains,
and the creatures of the field are mine.
12If I were hungry I would not tell you, for
the world is mine, and all that is in it.
13Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the
blood of goats?
14Sacrifice thank offerings to God, fulfill
your vows to the Most High,
15and call upon me in the day of trouble;
I will deliver you, and you will honor me."
16But to the wicked, God says: "What
right have you to recite my laws or take
my covenant on your lips?
17You hate my instruction and cast my
words behind you.
18When you see a thief, you join with
him; you throw in your lot with adulterers.
19You use your mouth for evil and
harness your tongue to deceit.
20You speak continually against your
brother and slander your own mother's
son.
21These things you have done and I kept
silent; you thought I was altogether like
you. But I will rebuke you and accuse
you to your face.
22"Consider this, you who forget God, or
I will tear you to pieces, with none to
rescue:
23He who sacrifices thank offerings
honors me, and he prepares the way so
that I may show him the salvation of
God."
PSALM 51
1Have mercy on me, O God, according
to your unfailing love; according to your
great compassion blot out my
transgressions.
2Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse
me from my sin.
3For I know my transgressions, and my
sin is always before me.
4Against you, you only, have I sinned
and done what is evil in your sight, so
that you are proved right when you
speak and justified when you judge.
5Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from
the time my mother conceived me.
6Surely you desire truth in the inner
parts ; you teach me wisdom in the
inmost place.
7Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be
clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than
snow.
8Let me hear joy and gladness; let the
bones you have crushed rejoice.
9Hide your face from my sins and blot
out all my iniquity.
10Create in me a pure heart, O God, and
renew a steadfast spirit within me.
11Do not cast me from your presence or
take your Holy Spirit from me.
12Restore to me the joy of your salvation
and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain
me.
13Then I will teach transgressors your
ways, and sinners will turn back to you.
14Save me from bloodguilt, O God, the
God who saves me, and my tongue will
sing of your righteousness.
15O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth
will declare your praise.
16You do not delight in sacrifice, or I
would bring it; you do not take pleasure
in burnt offerings.
17The sacrifices of God are a broken
spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O
God, you will not despise.
18In your good pleasure make Zion
prosper; build up the walls of Jerusalem.
19Then there will be righteous sacrifices,
whole burnt offerings to delight you;
then bulls will be offered on your altar.
PSALM 52
1Why do you boast of evil, you mighty
man? Why do you boast all day long,
you who are a disgrace in the eyes of
God?
2Your tongue plots destruction; it is like
a sharpened razor, you who practice
deceit.
3You love evil rather than good,
falsehood rather than speaking the truth.
Selah
4You love every harmful word, O you
deceitful tongue!
5Surely God will bring you down to
everlasting ruin: He will snatch you up
and tear you from your tent; he will
uproot you from the land of the living.
Selah
6The righteous will see and fear; they
will laugh at him, saying,
7"Here now is the man who did not
make God his stronghold but trusted in
his great wealth and grew strong by
destroying others!"
8But I am like an olive tree flourishing in
the house of God; I trust in God's
unfailing love for ever and ever.
9I will praise you forever for what you
have done; in your name I will hope, for
your name is good. I will praise you in
the presence of your saints.
PSALM 53
1The fool says in his heart, "There is no
God." They are corrupt, and their ways
are vile; there is no one who does good.
2God looks down from heaven on the
sons of men to see if there are any who
understand, any who seek God.
3Everyone has turned away, they have
together become corrupt; there is no
one who does good, not even one.
4Will the evildoers never learn- those
who devour my people as men eat
bread and who do not call on God?
5There they were, overwhelmed with
dread, where there was nothing to dread.
God scattered the bones of those who
attacked you; you put them to shame,
for God despised them.
6Oh, that salvation for Israel would come
out of Zion! When God restores the
fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice
and Israel be glad!
PSALM 54
1Save me, O God, by your name;
vindicate me by your might.
2Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the
words of my mouth.
3Strangers are attacking me; ruthless
men seek my life- men without regard
for God. Selah
4Surely God is my help; the Lord is the
one who sustains me.
5Let evil recoil on those who slander me;
in your faithfulness destroy them.
6I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you; I
will praise your name, O Lord , for it is
good.
7For he has delivered me from all my
troubles, and my eyes have looked in
triumph on my foes.
PSALM 55
1Listen to my prayer, O God, do not
ignore my plea;
2hear me and answer me. My thoughts
trouble me and I am distraught
3at the voice of the enemy, at the stares
of the wicked; for they bring down
suffering upon me and revile me in their
anger.
4My heart is in anguish within me; the
terrors of death assail me.
5Fear and trembling have beset me;
horror has overwhelmed me.
6I said, "Oh, that I had the wings of a
dove! I would fly away and be at rest-
7I would flee far away and stay in the
desert; Selah
8I would hurry to my place of shelter, far
from the tempest and storm."
9Confuse the wicked, O Lord, confound
their speech, for I see violence and strife
in the city.
10Day and night they prowl about on its
walls; malice and abuse are within it.
11Destructive forces are at work in the
city; threats and lies never leave its
streets.
12If an enemy were insulting me, I could
endure it; if a foe were raising himself
against me, I could hide from him.
13But it is you, a man like myself, my
companion, my close friend,
14with whom I once enjoyed sweet
fellowship as we walked with the throng
at the house of God.
15Let death take my enemies by
surprise; let them go down alive to the
grave, for evil finds lodging among them.
16But I call to God, and the Lord saves
me.
17Evening, morning and noon I cry out in
distress, and he hears my voice.
18He ransoms me unharmed from the
battle waged against me, even though
many oppose me.
19God, who is enthroned forever, will
hear them and afflict them- Selah men
who never change their ways and have
no fear of God.
20My companion attacks his friends; he
violates his covenant.
21His speech is smooth as butter, yet
war is in his heart; his words are more
soothing than oil, yet they are drawn
swords.
22Cast your cares on the Lord and he
will sustain you; he will never let the
righteous fall.
23But you, O God, will bring down the
wicked into the pit of corruption;
bloodthirsty and deceitful men will not
live out half their days. But as for me, I
trust in you.
PSALM 56
1Be merciful to me, O God, for men hotly
pursue me; all day long they press their
attack.
2My slanderers pursue me all day long;
many are attacking me in their pride.
3When I am afraid, I will trust in you.
4In God, whose word I praise, in God I
trust; I will not be afraid. What can
mortal man do to me?
5All day long they twist my words; they
are always plotting to harm me.
6They conspire, they lurk, they watch my
steps, eager to take my life.
7On no account let them escape; in your
anger, O God, bring down the nations.
8Record my lament; list my tears on your
scroll - are they not in your record?
9Then my enemies will turn back when I
call for help. By this I will know that God
is for me.
10In God, whose word I praise, in the
Lord , whose word I praise-
11in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What
can man do to me?
12I am under vows to you, O God; I will
present my thank offerings to you.
13For you have delivered me from death
and my feet from stumbling, that I may
walk before God in the light of life.
PSALM 57
1Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy
on me, for in you my soul takes refuge. I
will take refuge in the shadow of your
wings until the disaster has passed.
2I cry out to God Most High, to God, who
fulfills [his purpose] for me.
3He sends from heaven and saves me,
rebuking those who hotly pursue me;
Selah God sends his love and his
faithfulness.
4I am in the midst of lions; I lie among
ravenous beasts- men whose teeth are
spears and arrows, whose tongues are
sharp swords.
5Be exalted, O God, above the heavens;
let your glory be over all the earth.
6They spread a net for my feet- I was
bowed down in distress. They dug a pit
in my path- but they have fallen into it
themselves. Selah
7My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart
is steadfast; I will sing and make music.
8Awake, my soul! Awake, harp and lyre!
I will awaken the dawn.
9I will praise you, O Lord, among the
nations; I will sing of you among the
peoples.
10For great is your love, reaching to the
heavens; your faithfulness reaches to
the skies.
11Be exalted, O God, above the
heavens; let your glory be over all the
earth.
PSALM 58
1Do you rulers indeed speak justly? Do
you judge uprightly among men?
2No, in your heart you devise injustice,
and your hands mete out violence on
the earth.
3Even from birth the wicked go astray;
from the womb they are wayward and
speak lies.
4Their venom is like the venom of a
snake, like that of a cobra that has
stopped its ears,
5that will not heed the tune of the
charmer, however skillful the enchanter
may be.
6Break the teeth in their mouths, O God;
tear out, O Lord , the fangs of the lions!
7Let them vanish like water that flows
away; when they draw the bow, let their
arrows be blunted.
8Like a slug melting away as it moves
along, like a stillborn child, may they not
see the sun.
9Before your pots can feel the heat of
the thorns- whether they be green or
dry-the wicked will be swept away.
10The righteous will be glad when they
are avenged, when they bathe their feet
in the blood of the wicked.
11Then men will say, "Surely the
righteous still are rewarded; surely there
is a God who judges the earth."
PSALM 59
1Deliver me from my enemies, O God;
protect me from those who rise up
against me.
2Deliver me from evildoers and save me
from bloodthirsty men.
3See how they lie in wait for me! Fierce
men conspire against me for no offense
or sin of mine, O Lord .
4I have done no wrong, yet they are
ready to attack me. Arise to help me;
look on my plight!
5O Lord God Almighty, the God of Israel,
rouse yourself to punish all the nations;
show no mercy to wicked traitors. Selah
6They return at evening, snarling like
dogs, and prowl about the city.
7See what they spew from their mouthsthey
spew out swords from their lips,
and they say, "Who can hear us?"
8But you, O Lord , laugh at them; you
scoff at all those nations.
9O my Strength, I watch for you; you, O
God, are my fortress,
10my loving God. God will go before me
and will let me gloat over those who
slander me.
11But do not kill them, O Lord our shield,
or my people will forget. In your might
make them wander about, and bring
them down.
12For the sins of their mouths, for the
words of their lips, let them be caught in
their pride. For the curses and lies they
utter,
13consume them in wrath, consume
them till they are no more. Then it will be
known to the ends of the earth that God
rules over Jacob. Selah
14They return at evening, snarling like
dogs, and prowl about the city.
15They wander about for food and howl
if not satisfied.
16But I will sing of your strength, in the
morning I will sing of your love; for you
are my fortress, my refuge in times of
trouble.
17O my Strength, I sing praise to you;
you, O God, are my fortress, my loving
God.
PSALM 60
1You have rejected us, O God, and burst
forth upon us; you have been angry-now
restore us!
2You have shaken the land and torn it
open; mend its fractures, for it is
quaking.
3You have shown your people desperate
times; you have given us wine that
makes us stagger.
4But for those who fear you, you have
raised a banner to be unfurled against
the bow. Selah
5Save us and help us with your right
hand, that those you love may be
delivered.
6God has spoken from his sanctuary: "In
triumph I will parcel out Shechem and
measure off the Valley of Succoth.
7Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine;
Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my
scepter.
8Moab is my washbasin, upon Edom I
toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in
triumph."
9Who will bring me to the fortified city?
Who will lead me to Edom?
10Is it not you, O God, you who have
rejected us and no longer go out with
our armies?
11Give us aid against the enemy, for the
help of man is worthless.
12With God we will gain the victory, and
he will trample down our enemies.
PSALM 61
1Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer.
2From the ends of the earth I call to you,
I call as my heart grows faint; lead me to
the rock that is higher than I.
3For you have been my refuge, a strong
tower against the foe.
4I long to dwell in your tent forever and
take refuge in the shelter of your wings.
Selah
5For you have heard my vows, O God;
you have given me the heritage of those
who fear your name.
6Increase the days of the king's life, his
years for many generations.
7May he be enthroned in God's
presence forever; appoint your love and
faithfulness to protect him.
8Then will I ever sing praise to your
name and fulfill my vows day after day.
PSALM 62
1My soul finds rest in God alone; my
salvation comes from him.
2He alone is my rock and my salvation;
he is my fortress, I will never be shaken.
3How long will you assault a man?
Would all of you throw him down- this
leaning wall, this tottering fence?
4They fully intend to topple him from his
lofty place; they take delight in lies. With
their mouths they bless, but in their
hearts they curse. Selah
5Find rest, O my soul, in God alone; my
hope comes from him.
6He alone is my rock and my salvation;
he is my fortress, I will not be shaken.
7My salvation and my honor depend on
God ; he is my mighty rock, my refuge.
8Trust in him at all times, O people; pour
out your hearts to him, for God is our
refuge. Selah
9Lowborn men are but a breath, the
highborn are but a lie; if weighed on a
balance, they are nothing; together they
are only a breath.
10Do not trust in extortion or take pride in
stolen goods; though your riches
increase, do not set your heart on them.
11One thing God has spoken, two things
have I heard: that you, O God, are
strong,
12and that you, O Lord, are loving.
Surely you will reward each person
according to what he has done.
PSALM 63
1O God, you are my God, earnestly I
seek you; my soul thirsts for you, my
body longs for you, in a dry and weary
land where there is no water.
2I have seen you in the sanctuary and
beheld your power and your glory.
3Because your love is better than life,
my lips will glorify you.
4I will praise you as long as I live, and in
your name I will lift up my hands.
5My soul will be satisfied as with the
richest of foods; with singing lips my
mouth will praise you.
6On my bed I remember you; I think of
you through the watches of the night.
7Because you are my help, I sing in the
shadow of your wings.
8My soul clings to you; your right hand
upholds me.
9They who seek my life will be
destroyed; they will go down to the
depths of the earth.
10They will be given over to the sword
and become food for jackals.
11But the king will rejoice in God; all who
swear by God's name will praise him,
while the mouths of liars will be silenced.
PSALM 64
1Hear me, O God, as I voice my
complaint; protect my life from the threat
of the enemy.
2Hide me from the conspiracy of the
wicked, from that noisy crowd of
evildoers.
3They sharpen their tongues like swords
and aim their words like deadly arrows.
4They shoot from ambush at the
innocent man; they shoot at him
suddenly, without fear.
5They encourage each other in evil
plans, they talk about hiding their
snares; they say, "Who will see them ?"
6They plot injustice and say, "We have
devised a perfect plan!" Surely the mind
and heart of man are cunning.
7But God will shoot them with arrows;
suddenly they will be struck down.
8He will turn their own tongues against
them and bring them to ruin; all who see
them will shake their heads in scorn.
9All mankind will fear; they will proclaim
the works of God and ponder what he
has done.
10Let the righteous rejoice in the Lord
and take refuge in him; let all the upright
in heart praise him!
PSALM 65
1Praise awaits you, O God, in Zion; to
you our vows will be fulfilled.
2O you who hear prayer, to you all men
will come.
3When we were overwhelmed by sins,
you forgave our transgressions.
4Blessed are those you choose and
bring near to live in your courts! We are
filled with the good things of your house,
of your holy temple.
5You answer us with awesome deeds of
righteousness, O God our Savior, the
hope of all the ends of the earth and of
the farthest seas,
6who formed the mountains by your
power, having armed yourself with
strength,
7who stilled the roaring of the seas, the
roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of
the nations.
8Those living far away fear your
wonders; where morning dawns and
evening fades you call forth songs of joy.
9You care for the land and water it; you
enrich it abundantly. The streams of
God are filled with water to provide the
people with grain, for so you have
ordained it.
10You drench its furrows and level its
ridges; you soften it with showers and
bless its crops.
11You crown the year with your bounty,
and your carts overflow with abundance.
12The grasslands of the desert overflow;
the hills are clothed with gladness.
13The meadows are covered with flocks
and the valleys are mantled with grain;
they shout for joy and sing.
PSALM 66
1Shout with joy to God, all the earth!
2Sing the glory of his name; make his
praise glorious!
3Say to God, "How awesome are your
deeds! So great is your power that your
enemies cringe before you.
4All the earth bows down to you; they
sing praise to you, they sing praise to
your name." Selah
5Come and see what God has done,
how awesome his works in man's
behalf!
6He turned the sea into dry land, they
passed through the waters on footcome,
let us rejoice in him.
7He rules forever by his power, his eyes
watch the nations- let not the rebellious
rise up against him. Selah
8Praise our God, O peoples, let the
sound of his praise be heard;
9he has preserved our lives and kept our
feet from slipping.
10For you, O God, tested us; you refined
us like silver.
11You brought us into prison and laid
burdens on our backs.
12You let men ride over our heads; we
went through fire and water, but you
brought us to a place of abundance.
13I will come to your temple with burnt
offerings and fulfill my vows to you-
14vows my lips promised and my mouth
spoke when I was in trouble.
15I will sacrifice fat animals to you and
an offering of rams; I will offer bulls and
goats. Selah
16Come and listen, all you who fear God;
let me tell you what he has done for me.
17I cried out to him with my mouth; his
praise was on my tongue.
18If I had cherished sin in my heart, the
Lord would not have listened;
19but God has surely listened and heard
my voice in prayer.
20Praise be to God, who has not
rejected my prayer or withheld his love
from me!
PSALM 67
1May God be gracious to us and bless
us and make his face shine upon us,
Selah
2that your ways may be known on earth,
your salvation among all nations.
3May the peoples praise you, O God;
may all the peoples praise you.
4May the nations be glad and sing for
joy, for you rule the peoples justly and
guide the nations of the earth. Selah
5May the peoples praise you, O God;
may all the peoples praise you.
6Then the land will yield its harvest, and
God, our God, will bless us.
7God will bless us, and all the ends of
the earth will fear him.
PSALM 68
1May God arise, may his enemies be
scattered; may his foes flee before him.
2As smoke is blown away by the wind,
may you blow them away; as wax melts
before the fire, may the wicked perish
before God.
3But may the righteous be glad and
rejoice before God; may they be happy
and joyful.
4Sing to God, sing praise to his name,
extol him who rides on the clouds - his
name is the Lord - and rejoice before
him.
5A father to the fatherless, a defender of
widows, is God in his holy dwelling.
6God sets the lonely in families, he leads
forth the prisoners with singing; but the
rebellious live in a sun-scorched land.
7When you went out before your people,
O God, when you marched through the
wasteland, Selah
8the earth shook, the heavens poured
down rain, before God, the One of Sinai,
before God, the God of Israel.
9You gave abundant showers, O God;
you refreshed your weary inheritance.
10Your people settled in it, and from your
bounty, O God, you provided for the
poor.
11The Lord announced the word, and
great was the company of those who
proclaimed it:
12"Kings and armies flee in haste; in the
camps men divide the plunder.
13Even while you sleep among the
campfires, the wings of my dove are
sheathed with silver, its feathers with
shining gold."
14When the Almighty scattered the kings
in the land, it was like snow fallen on
Zalmon.
15The mountains of Bashan are majestic
mountains; rugged are the mountains of
Bashan.
16Why gaze in envy, O rugged
mountains, at the mountain where God
chooses to reign, where the Lord
himself will dwell forever?
17The chariots of God are tens of
thousands and thousands of thousands;
the Lord has come from Sinai into his
sanctuary.
18When you ascended on high, you led
captives in your train; you received gifts
from men, even from the rebellious- that
you, O Lord God, might dwell there.
19Praise be to the Lord, to God our
Savior, who daily bears our burdens.
Selah
20Our God is a God who saves; from the
Sovereign Lord comes escape from
death.
21Surely God will crush the heads of his
enemies, the hairy crowns of those who
go on in their sins.
22The Lord says, "I will bring them from
Bashan; I will bring them from the
depths of the sea,
23that you may plunge your feet in the
blood of your foes, while the tongues of
your dogs have their share."
24Your procession has come into view,
O God, the procession of my God and
King into the sanctuary.
25In front are the singers, after them the
musicians; with them are the maidens
playing tambourines.
26Praise God in the great congregation;
praise the Lord in the assembly of Israel.
27There is the little tribe of Benjamin,
leading them, there the great throng of
Judah's princes, and there the princes of
Zebulun and of Naphtali.
28Summon your power, O God ; show us
your strength, O God, as you have done
before.
29Because of your temple at Jerusalem
kings will bring you gifts.
30Rebuke the beast among the reeds,
the herd of bulls among the calves of
the nations. Humbled, may it bring bars
of silver. Scatter the nations who delight
in war.
31Envoys will come from Egypt; Cush
will submit herself to God.
32Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth,
sing praise to the Lord, Selah
33to him who rides the ancient skies
above, who thunders with mighty voice.
34Proclaim the power of God, whose
majesty is over Israel, whose power is in
the skies.
35You are awesome, O God, in your
sanctuary; the God of Israel gives power
and strength to his people. Praise be to
God!
PSALM 69
1Save me, O God, for the waters have
come up to my neck.
2I sink in the miry depths, where there is
no foothold. I have come into the deep
waters; the floods engulf me.
3I am worn out calling for help; my throat
is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my
God.
4Those who hate me without reason
outnumber the hairs of my head; many
are my enemies without cause, those
who seek to destroy me. I am forced to
restore what I did not steal.
5You know my folly, O God; my guilt is
not hidden from you.
6May those who hope in you not be
disgraced because of me, O Lord, the
Lord Almighty; may those who seek you
not be put to shame because of me, O
God of Israel.
7For I endure scorn for your sake, and
shame covers my face.
8I am a stranger to my brothers, an alien
to my own mother's sons;
9for zeal for your house consumes me,
and the insults of those who insult you
fall on me.
10When I weep and fast, I must endure
scorn;
11when I put on sackcloth, people make
sport of me.
12Those who sit at the gate mock me,
and I am the song of the drunkards.
13But I pray to you, O Lord , in the time
of your favor; in your great love, O God,
answer me with your sure salvation.
14Rescue me from the mire, do not let
me sink; deliver me from those who hate
me, from the deep waters.
15Do not let the floodwaters engulf me or
the depths swallow me up or the pit
close its mouth over me.
16Answer me, O Lord , out of the
goodness of your love; in your great
mercy turn to me.
17Do not hide your face from your
servant; answer me quickly, for I am in
trouble.
18Come near and rescue me; redeem
me because of my foes.
19You know how I am scorned,
disgraced and shamed; all my enemies
are before you.
20Scorn has broken my heart and has
left me helpless; I looked for sympathy,
but there was none, for comforters, but I
found none.
21They put gall in my food and gave me
vinegar for my thirst.
22May the table set before them become
a snare; may it become retribution and a
trap.
23May their eyes be darkened so they
cannot see, and their backs be bent
forever.
24Pour out your wrath on them; let your
fierce anger overtake them.
25May their place be deserted; let there
be no one to dwell in their tents.
26For they persecute those you wound
and talk about the pain of those you hurt.
27Charge them with crime upon crime;
do not let them share in your salvation.
28May they be blotted out of the book of
life and not be listed with the righteous.
29I am in pain and distress; may your
salvation, O God, protect me.
30I will praise God's name in song and
glorify him with thanksgiving.
31This will please the Lord more than an
ox, more than a bull with its horns and
hoofs.
32The poor will see and be glad- you
who seek God, may your hearts live!
33The Lord hears the needy and does
not despise his captive people.
34Let heaven and earth praise him, the
seas and all that move in them,
35for God will save Zion and rebuild the
cities of Judah. Then people will settle
there and possess it;
36the children of his servants will inherit
it, and those who love his name will
dwell there.
PSALM 70
1Hasten, O God, to save me; O Lord ,
come quickly to help me.
2May those who seek my life be put to
shame and confusion; may all who
desire my ruin be turned back in
disgrace.
3May those who say to me, "Aha! Aha!"
turn back because of their shame.
4But may all who seek you rejoice and
be glad in you; may those who love your
salvation always say, "Let God be
exalted!"
5Yet I am poor and needy; come quickly
to me, O God. You are my help and my
deliverer; O Lord , do not delay.
PSALM 71
1In you, O Lord , I have taken refuge; let
me never be put to shame.
2Rescue me and deliver me in your
righteousness; turn your ear to me and
save me.
3Be my rock of refuge, to which I can
always go; give the command to save
me, for you are my rock and my fortress.
4Deliver me, O my God, from the hand
of the wicked, from the grasp of evil and
cruel men.
5For you have been my hope, O
Sovereign Lord , my confidence since
my youth.
6From birth I have relied on you; you
brought me forth from my mother's
womb. I will ever praise you.
7I have become like a portent to many,
but you are my strong refuge.
8My mouth is filled with your praise,
declaring your splendor all day long.
9Do not cast me away when I am old; do
not forsake me when my strength is
gone.
10For my enemies speak against me;
those who wait to kill me conspire
together.
11They say, "God has forsaken him;
pursue him and seize him, for no one
will rescue him."
12Be not far from me, O God; come
quickly, O my God, to help me.
13May my accusers perish in shame;
may those who want to harm me be
covered with scorn and disgrace.
14But as for me, I will always have hope;
I will praise you more and more.
15My mouth will tell of your
righteousness, of your salvation all day
long, though I know not its measure.
16I will come and proclaim your mighty
acts, O Sovereign Lord ; I will proclaim
your righteousness, yours alone.
17Since my youth, O God, you have
taught me, and to this day I declare your
marvelous deeds.
18Even when I am old and gray, do not
forsake me, O God, till I declare your
power to the next generation, your might
to all who are to come.
19Your righteousness reaches to the
skies, O God, you who have done great
things. Who, O God, is like you?
20Though you have made me see
troubles, many and bitter, you will
restore my life again; from the depths of
the earth you will again bring me up.
21You will increase my honor and
comfort me once again.
22I will praise you with the harp for your
faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praise
to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.
23My lips will shout for joy when I sing
praise to you- I, whom you have
redeemed.
24My tongue will tell of your righteous
acts all day long, for those who wanted
to harm me have been put to shame
and confusion.
PSALM 72
1Endow the king with your justice, O
God, the royal son with your
righteousness.
2He will judge your people in
righteousness, your afflicted ones with
justice.
3The mountains will bring prosperity to
the people, the hills the fruit of
righteousness.
4He will defend the afflicted among the
people and save the children of the
needy; he will crush the oppressor.
5He will endure as long as the sun, as
long as the moon, through all
generations.
6He will be like rain falling on a mown
field, like showers watering the earth.
7In his days the righteous will flourish;
prosperity will abound till the moon is no
more.
8He will rule from sea to sea and from
the River to the ends of the earth.
9The desert tribes will bow before him
and his enemies will lick the dust.
10The kings of Tarshish and of distant
shores will bring tribute to him; the kings
of Sheba and Seba will present him gifts.
11All kings will bow down to him and all
nations will serve him.
12For he will deliver the needy who cry
out, the afflicted who have no one to
help.
13He will take pity on the weak and the
needy and save the needy from death.
14He will rescue them from oppression
and violence, for precious is their blood
in his sight.
15Long may he live! May gold from
Sheba be given him. May people ever
pray for him and bless him all day long.
16Let grain abound throughout the land;
on the tops of the hills may it sway. Let
its fruit flourish like Lebanon; let it thrive
like the grass of the field.
17May his name endure forever; may it
continue as long as the sun. All nations
will be blessed through him, and they
will call him blessed.
18Praise be to the Lord God, the God of
Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.
19Praise be to his glorious name forever;
may the whole earth be filled with his
glory. Amen and Amen.
20This concludes the prayers of David
son of Jesse.
PSALM 73
1p header A psalm of Asaph. /header
Surely God is good to Israel, p to those
who are pure in heart. pp>
2But as for me, my feet had almost
slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold.
3For I envied the arrogant when I saw
the prosperity of the wicked.
4They have no struggles; their bodies
are healthy and strong.
5They are free from the burdens
common to man; they are not plagued
by human ills.
6Therefore pride is their necklace; they
clothe themselves with violence.
7From their callous hearts comes
iniquity ; the evil conceits of their minds
know no limits.
8They scoff, and speak with malice; in
their arrogance they threaten
oppression.
9Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and
their tongues take possession of the
earth.
10Therefore their people turn to them
and drink up waters in abundance.
11They say, "How can God know? Does
the Most High have knowledge?"
12This is what the wicked are likealways
carefree, they increase in wealth.
13Surely in vain have I kept my heart
pure; in vain have I washed my hands in
innocence.
14All day long I have been plagued; I
have been punished every morning.
15If I had said, "I will speak thus," I would
have betrayed your children.
16When I tried to understand all this, it
was oppressive to me
17till I entered the sanctuary of God; then
I understood their final destiny.
18Surely you place them on slippery
ground; you cast them down to ruin.
19How suddenly are they destroyed,
completely swept away by terrors!
20As a dream when one awakes, so
when you arise, O Lord, you will despise
them as fantasies.
21When my heart was grieved and my
spirit embittered,
22I was senseless and ignorant; I was a
brute beast before you.
23Yet I am always with you; you hold me
by my right hand.
24You guide me with your counsel, and
afterward you will take me into glory.
25Whom have I in heaven but you? And
earth has nothing I desire besides you.
26My flesh and my heart may fail, but
God is the strength of my heart and my
portion forever.
27Those who are far from you will perish;
you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.
28But as for me, it is good to be near
God. I have made the Sovereign Lord
my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds.
PSALM 74
1Why have you rejected us forever, O
God? Why does your anger smolder
against the sheep of your pasture?
2Remember the people you purchased
of old, the tribe of your inheritance,
whom you redeemed- Mount Zion,
where you dwelt.
3Turn your steps toward these
everlasting ruins, all this destruction the
enemy has brought on the sanctuary.
4Your foes roared in the place where
you met with us; they set up their
standards as signs.
5They behaved like men wielding axes
to cut through a thicket of trees.
6They smashed all the carved paneling
with their axes and hatchets.
7They burned your sanctuary to the
ground; they defiled the dwelling place
of your Name.
8They said in their hearts, "We will crush
them completely!" They burned every
place where God was worshiped in the
land.
9We are given no miraculous signs; no
prophets are left, and none of us knows
how long this will be.
10How long will the enemy mock you, O
God? Will the foe revile your name
forever?
11Why do you hold back your hand, your
right hand? Take it from the folds of your
garment and destroy them!
12But you, O God, are my king from of
old; you bring salvation upon the earth.
13It was you who split open the sea by
your power; you broke the heads of the
monster in the waters.
14It was you who crushed the heads of
Leviathan and gave him as food to the
creatures of the desert.
15It was you who opened up springs and
streams; you dried up the ever flowing
rivers.
16The day is yours, and yours also the
night; you established the sun and moon.
17It was you who set all the boundaries
of the earth; you made both summer
and winter.
18Remember how the enemy has
mocked you, O Lord , how foolish
people have reviled your name.
19Do not hand over the life of your dove
to wild beasts; do not forget the lives of
your afflicted people forever.
20Have regard for your covenant,
because haunts of violence fill the dark
places of the land.
21Do not let the oppressed retreat in
disgrace; may the poor and needy
praise your name.
22Rise up, O God, and defend your
cause; remember how fools mock you
all day long.
23Do not ignore the clamor of your
adversaries, the uproar of your enemies,
which rises continually.
PSALM 75
1We give thanks to you, O God, we give
thanks, for your Name is near; men tell
of your wonderful deeds.
2You say, "I choose the appointed time;
it is I who judge uprightly.
3When the earth and all its people quake,
it is I who hold its pillars firm. Selah
4To the arrogant I say, 'Boast no more,'
and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up your
horns.
5Do not lift your horns against heaven;
do not speak with outstretched neck.' "
6No one from the east or the west or
from the desert can exalt a man.
7But it is God who judges: He brings one
down, he exalts another.
8In the hand of the Lord is a cup full of
foaming wine mixed with spices; he
pours it out, and all the wicked of the
earth drink it down to its very dregs.
9As for me, I will declare this forever; I
will sing praise to the God of Jacob.
10I will cut off the horns of all the wicked,
but the horns of the righteous will be
lifted up.
PSALM 76
1In Judah God is known; his name is
great in Israel.
2His tent is in Salem, his dwelling place
in Zion.
3There he broke the flashing arrows, the
shields and the swords, the weapons of
war. Selah
4You are resplendent with light, more
majestic than mountains rich with game.
5Valiant men lie plundered, they sleep
their last sleep; not one of the warriors
can lift his hands.
6At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both
horse and chariot lie still.
7You alone are to be feared. Who can
stand before you when you are angry?
8From heaven you pronounced
judgment, and the land feared and was
quiet-
9when you, O God, rose up to judge, to
save all the afflicted of the land. Selah
10Surely your wrath against men brings
you praise, and the survivors of your
wrath are restrained.
11Make vows to the Lord your God and
fulfill them; let all the neighboring lands
bring gifts to the One to be feared.
12He breaks the spirit of rulers; he is
feared by the kings of the earth.
PSALM 77
1I cried out to God for help; I cried out to
God to hear me.
2When I was in distress, I sought the
Lord; at night I stretched out untiring
hands and my soul refused to be
comforted.
3I remembered you, O God, and I
groaned; I mused, and my spirit grew
faint. Selah
4You kept my eyes from closing; I was
too troubled to speak.
5I thought about the former days, the
years of long ago;
6I remembered my songs in the night.
My heart mused and my spirit inquired:
7"Will the Lord reject forever? Will he
never show his favor again?
8Has his unfailing love vanished
forever? Has his promise failed for all
time?
9Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has
he in anger withheld his compassion?"
Selah
10Then I thought, "To this I will appeal:
the years of the right hand of the Most
High."
11I will remember the deeds of the Lord ;
yes, I will remember your miracles of
long ago.
12I will meditate on all your works and
consider all your mighty deeds.
13Your ways, O God, are holy. What god
is so great as our God?
14You are the God who performs
miracles; you display your power among
the peoples.
15With your mighty arm you redeemed
your people, the descendants of Jacob
and Joseph. Selah
16The waters saw you, O God, the
waters saw you and writhed; the very
depths were convulsed.
17The clouds poured down water, the
skies resounded with thunder; your
arrows flashed back and forth.
18Your thunder was heard in the
whirlwind, your lightning lit up the world;
the earth trembled and quaked.
19Your path led through the sea, your
way through the mighty waters, though
your footprints were not seen.
20You led your people like a flock by the
hand of Moses and Aaron.
PSALM 78
1O my people, hear my teaching; listen
to the words of my mouth.
2I will open my mouth in parables, I will
utter hidden things, things from of old-
3what we have heard and known, what
our fathers have told us.
4We will not hide them from their
children; we will tell the next generation
the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord , his
power, and the wonders he has done.
5He decreed statutes for Jacob and
established the law in Israel, which he
commanded our forefathers to teach
their children,
6so the next generation would know
them, even the children yet to be born,
and they in turn would tell their children.
7Then they would put their trust in God
and would not forget his deeds but
would keep his commands.
8They would not be like their forefathersa
stubborn and rebellious generation,
whose hearts were not loyal to God,
whose spirits were not faithful to him.
9The men of Ephraim, though armed
with bows, turned back on the day of
battle;
10they did not keep God's covenant and
refused to live by his law.
11They forgot what he had done, the
wonders he had shown them.
12He did miracles in the sight of their
fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region
of Zoan.
13He divided the sea and led them
through; he made the water stand firm
like a wall.
14He guided them with the cloud by day
and with light from the fire all night.
15He split the rocks in the desert and
gave them water as abundant as the
seas;
16he brought streams out of a rocky crag
and made water flow down like rivers.
17But they continued to sin against him,
rebelling in the desert against the Most
High.
18They willfully put God to the test by
demanding the food they craved.
19They spoke against God, saying, "Can
God spread a table in the desert?
20When he struck the rock, water
gushed out, and streams flowed
abundantly. But can he also give us
food? Can he supply meat for his
people?"
21When the Lord heard them, he was
very angry; his fire broke out against
Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel,
22for they did not believe in God or trust
in his deliverance.
23Yet he gave a command to the skies
above and opened the doors of the
heavens;
24he rained down manna for the people
to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven.
25Men ate the bread of angels; he sent
them all the food they could eat.
26He let loose the east wind from the
heavens and led forth the south wind by
his power.
27He rained meat down on them like
dust, flying birds like sand on the
seashore.
28He made them come down inside their
camp, all around their tents.
29They ate till they had more than
enough, for he had given them what
they craved.
30But before they turned from the food
they craved, even while it was still in
their mouths,
31God's anger rose against them; he put
to death the sturdiest among them,
cutting down the young men of Israel.
32In spite of all this, they kept on sinning;
in spite of his wonders, they did not
believe.
33So he ended their days in futility and
their years in terror.
34Whenever God slew them, they would
seek him; they eagerly turned to him
again.
35They remembered that God was their
Rock, that God Most High was their
Redeemer.
36But then they would flatter him with
their mouths, lying to him with their
tongues;
37their hearts were not loyal to him, they
were not faithful to his covenant.
38Yet he was merciful; he forgave their
iniquities and did not destroy them. Time
after time he restrained his anger and
did not stir up his full wrath.
39He remembered that they were but
flesh, a passing breeze that does not
return.
40How often they rebelled against him in
the desert and grieved him in the
wasteland!
41Again and again they put God to the
test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.
42They did not remember his power- the
day he redeemed them from the
oppressor,
43the day he displayed his miraculous
signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region
of Zoan.
44He turned their rivers to blood; they
could not drink from their streams.
45He sent swarms of flies that devoured
them, and frogs that devastated them.
46He gave their crops to the
grasshopper, their produce to the locust.
47He destroyed their vines with hail and
their sycamore-figs with sleet.
48He gave over their cattle to the hail,
their livestock to bolts of lightning.
49He unleashed against them his hot
anger, his wrath, indignation and
hostility- a band of destroying angels.
50He prepared a path for his anger; he
did not spare them from death but gave
them over to the plague.
51He struck down all the firstborn of
Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the
tents of Ham.
52But he brought his people out like a
flock; he led them like sheep through the
desert.
53He guided them safely, so they were
unafraid; but the sea engulfed their
enemies.
54Thus he brought them to the border of
his holy land, to the hill country his right
hand had taken.
55He drove out nations before them and
allotted their lands to them as an
inheritance; he settled the tribes of
Israel in their homes.
56But they put God to the test and
rebelled against the Most High; they did
not keep his statutes.
57Like their fathers they were disloyal
and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty
bow.
58They angered him with their high
places; they aroused his jealousy with
their idols.
59When God heard them, he was very
angry; he rejected Israel completely.
60He abandoned the tabernacle of
Shiloh, the tent he had set up among
men.
61He sent the ark of his might into
captivity, his splendor into the hands of
the enemy.
62He gave his people over to the sword;
he was very angry with his inheritance.
63Fire consumed their young men, and
their maidens had no wedding songs;
64their priests were put to the sword, and
their widows could not weep.
65Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,
as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.
66He beat back his enemies; he put
them to everlasting shame.
67Then he rejected the tents of Joseph,
he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;
68but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount
Zion, which he loved.
69He built his sanctuary like the heights,
like the earth that he established forever.
70He chose David his servant and took
him from the sheep pens;
71from tending the sheep he brought him
to be the shepherd of his people Jacob,
of Israel his inheritance.
72And David shepherded them with
integrity of heart; with skillful hands he
led them.
PSALM 79
1O God, the nations have invaded your
inheritance; they have defiled your holy
temple, they have reduced Jerusalem to
rubble.
2They have given the dead bodies of
your servants as food to the birds of the
air, the flesh of your saints to the beasts
of the earth.
3They have poured out blood like water
all around Jerusalem, and there is no
one to bury the dead.
4We are objects of reproach to our
neighbors, of scorn and derision to
those around us.
5How long, O Lord ? Will you be angry
forever? How long will your jealousy
burn like fire?
6Pour out your wrath on the nations that
do not acknowledge you, on the
kingdoms that do not call on your name;
7for they have devoured Jacob and
destroyed his homeland.
8Do not hold against us the sins of the
fathers; may your mercy come quickly to
meet us, for we are in desperate need.
9Help us, O God our Savior, for the glory
of your name; deliver us and forgive our
sins for your name's sake.
10Why should the nations say, "Where is
their God?" Before our eyes, make
known among the nations that you
avenge the outpoured blood of your
servants.
11May the groans of the prisoners come
before you; by the strength of your arm
preserve those condemned to die.
12Pay back into the laps of our
neighbors seven times the reproach
they have hurled at you, O Lord.
13Then we your people, the sheep of
your pasture, will praise you forever;
from generation to generation we will
recount your praise.
PSALM 80
1Hear us, O Shepherd of Israel, you who
lead Joseph like a flock; you who sit
enthroned between the cherubim, shine
forth
2before Ephraim, Benjamin and
Manasseh. Awaken your might; come
and save us.
3Restore us, O God; make your face
shine upon us, that we may be saved.
4O Lord God Almighty, how long will
your anger smolder against the prayers
of your people?
5You have fed them with the bread of
tears; you have made them drink tears
by the bowlful.
6You have made us a source of
contention to our neighbors, and our
enemies mock us.
7Restore us, O God Almighty; make
your face shine upon us, that we may be
saved.
8You brought a vine out of Egypt; you
drove out the nations and planted it.
9You cleared the ground for it, and it
took root and filled the land.
10The mountains were covered with its
shade, the mighty cedars with its
branches.
11It sent out its boughs to the Sea, its
shoots as far as the River.
12Why have you broken down its walls
so that all who pass by pick its grapes?
13Boars from the forest ravage it and the
creatures of the field feed on it.
14Return to us, O God Almighty! Look
down from heaven and see! Watch over
this vine,
15the root your right hand has planted,
the son you have raised up for yourself.
16Your vine is cut down, it is burned with
fire; at your rebuke your people perish.
17Let your hand rest on the man at your
right hand, the son of man you have
raised up for yourself.
18Then we will not turn away from you;
revive us, and we will call on your name.
19Restore us, O Lord God Almighty;
make your face shine upon us, that we
may be saved.
PSALM 81
1Sing for joy to God our strength; shout
aloud to the God of Jacob!
2Begin the music, strike the tambourine,
play the melodious harp and lyre.
3Sound the ram's horn at the New Moon,
and when the moon is full, on the day of
our Feast;
4this is a decree for Israel, an ordinance
of the God of Jacob.
5He established it as a statute for
Joseph when he went out against Egypt,
where we heard a language we did not
understand.
6He says, "I removed the burden from
their shoulders; their hands were set
free from the basket.
7In your distress you called and I
rescued you, I answered you out of a
thundercloud; I tested you at the waters
of Meribah. Selah
8"Hear, O my people, and I will warn
you- if you would but listen to me, O
Israel!
9You shall have no foreign god among
you; you shall not bow down to an alien
god.
10I am the Lord your God, who brought
you up out of Egypt. Open wide your
mouth and I will fill it.
11"But my people would not listen to me;
Israel would not submit to me.
12So I gave them over to their stubborn
hearts to follow their own devices.
13"If my people would but listen to me, if
Israel would follow my ways,
14how quickly would I subdue their
enemies and turn my hand against their
foes!
15Those who hate the Lord would cringe
before him, and their punishment would
last forever.
16But you would be fed with the finest of
wheat; with honey from the rock I would
satisfy you."
PSALM 82
1God presides in the great assembly; he
gives judgment among the "gods":
2"How long will you defend the unjust
and show partiality to the wicked? Selah
3Defend the cause of the weak and
fatherless; maintain the rights of the
poor and oppressed.
4Rescue the weak and needy; deliver
them from the hand of the wicked.
5"They know nothing, they understand
nothing. They walk about in darkness;
all the foundations of the earth are
shaken.
6"I said, 'You are "gods"; you are all
sons of the Most High.'
7But you will die like mere men; you will
fall like every other ruler."
8Rise up, O God, judge the earth, for all
the nations are your inheritance.
PSALM 83
1O God, do not keep silent; be not quiet,
O God, be not still.
2See how your enemies are astir, how
your foes rear their heads.
3With cunning they conspire against
your people; they plot against those you
cherish.
4"Come," they say, "let us destroy them
as a nation, that the name of Israel be
remembered no more."
5With one mind they plot together; they
form an alliance against you-
6the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
of Moab and the Hagrites,
7Gebal, Ammon and Amalek, Philistia,
with the people of Tyre.
8Even Assyria has joined them to lend
strength to the descendants of Lot.
Selah
9Do to them as you did to Midian, as you
did to Sisera and Jabin at the river
Kishon,
10who perished at Endor and became
like refuse on the ground.
11Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
all their princes like Zebah and
Zalmunna,
12who said, "Let us take possession of
the pasturelands of God."
13Make them like tumbleweed, O my
God, like chaff before the wind.
14As fire consumes the forest or a flame
sets the mountains ablaze,
15so pursue them with your tempest and
terrify them with your storm.
16Cover their faces with shame so that
men will seek your name, O Lord .
17May they ever be ashamed and
dismayed; may they perish in disgrace.
18Let them know that you, whose name
is the Lord - that you alone are the Most
High over all the earth.
PSALM 84
1How lovely is your dwelling place, O
Lord Almighty!
2My soul yearns, even faints, for the
courts of the Lord ; my heart and my
flesh cry out for the living God.
3Even the sparrow has found a home,
and the swallow a nest for herself,
where she may have her young- a place
near your altar, O Lord Almighty, my
King and my God.
4Blessed are those who dwell in your
house; they are ever praising you. Selah
5Blessed are those whose strength is in
you, who have set their hearts on
pilgrimage.
6As they pass through the Valley of
Baca, they make it a place of springs;
the autumn rains also cover it with pools.
7They go from strength to strength, till
each appears before God in Zion.
8Hear my prayer, O Lord God Almighty;
listen to me, O God of Jacob. Selah
9Look upon our shield, O God; look with
favor on your anointed one.
10Better is one day in your courts than a
thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a
doorkeeper in the house of my God than
dwell in the tents of the wicked.
11For the Lord God is a sun and shield;
the Lord bestows favor and honor; no
good thing does he withhold from those
whose walk is blameless.
12O Lord Almighty, blessed is the man
who trusts in you.
PSALM 85
1You showed favor to your land, O
Lord ; you restored the fortunes of
Jacob.
2You forgave the iniquity of your people
and covered all their sins. Selah
3You set aside all your wrath and turned
from your fierce anger.
4Restore us again, O God our Savior,
and put away your displeasure toward
us.
5Will you be angry with us forever? Will
you prolong your anger through all
generations?
6Will you not revive us again, that your
people may rejoice in you?
7Show us your unfailing love, O Lord ,
and grant us your salvation.
8I will listen to what God the Lord will
say; he promises peace to his people,
his saints- but let them not return to folly.
9Surely his salvation is near those who
fear him, that his glory may dwell in our
land.
10Love and faithfulness meet together;
righteousness and peace kiss each
other.
11Faithfulness springs forth from the
earth, and righteousness looks down
from heaven.
12The Lord will indeed give what is good,
and our land will yield its harvest.
13Righteousness goes before him and
prepares the way for his steps.
PSALM 86
1Hear, O Lord , and answer me, for I am
poor and needy.
2Guard my life, for I am devoted to you.
You are my God; save your servant who
trusts in you.
3Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I call to
you all day long.
4Bring joy to your servant, for to you, O
Lord, I lift up my soul.
5You are forgiving and good, O Lord,
abounding in love to all who call to you.
6Hear my prayer, O Lord ; listen to my
cry for mercy.
7In the day of my trouble I will call to you,
for you will answer me.
8Among the gods there is none like you,
O Lord; no deeds can compare with
yours.
9All the nations you have made will
come and worship before you, O Lord;
they will bring glory to your name.
10For you are great and do marvelous
deeds; you alone are God.
11Teach me your way, O Lord , and I will
walk in your truth; give me an undivided
heart, that I may fear your name.
12I will praise you, O Lord my God, with
all my heart; I will glorify your name
forever.
13For great is your love toward me; you
have delivered me from the depths of
the grave.
14The arrogant are attacking me, O God;
a band of ruthless men seeks my lifemen
without regard for you.
15But you, O Lord, are a compassionate
and gracious God, slow to anger,
abounding in love and faithfulness.
16Turn to me and have mercy on me;
grant your strength to your servant and
save the son of your maidservant.
17Give me a sign of your goodness, that
my enemies may see it and be put to
shame, for you, O Lord , have helped
me and comforted me.
PSALM 87
1He has set his foundation on the holy
mountain;
2the Lord loves the gates of Zion more
than all the dwellings of Jacob.
3Glorious things are said of you, O city
of God: Selah
4"I will record Rahab and Babylon
among those who acknowledge me-
Philistia too, and Tyre, along with Cush -
and will say, 'This one was born in Zion.'
"
5Indeed, of Zion it will be said, "This one
and that one were born in her, and the
Most High himself will establish her."
6The Lord will write in the register of the
peoples: "This one was born in Zion."
Selah
7As they make music they will sing, "All
my fountains are in you."
PSALM 88
1O Lord , the God who saves me, day
and night I cry out before you.
2May my prayer come before you; turn
your ear to my cry.
3For my soul is full of trouble and my life
draws near the grave.
4I am counted among those who go
down to the pit; I am like a man without
strength.
5I am set apart with the dead, like the
slain who lie in the grave, whom you
remember no more, who are cut off from
your care.
6You have put me in the lowest pit, in
the darkest depths.
7Your wrath lies heavily upon me; you
have overwhelmed me with all your
waves. Selah
8You have taken from me my closest
friends and have made me repulsive to
them. I am confined and cannot escape;
9my eyes are dim with grief. I call to you,
O Lord , every day; I spread out my
hands to you.
10Do you show your wonders to the
dead? Do those who are dead rise up
and praise you? Selah
11Is your love declared in the grave, your
faithfulness in Destruction ?
12Are your wonders known in the place
of darkness, or your righteous deeds in
the land of oblivion?
13But I cry to you for help, O Lord ; in the
morning my prayer comes before you.
14Why, O Lord , do you reject me and
hide your face from me?
15From my youth I have been afflicted
and close to death; I have suffered your
terrors and am in despair.
16Your wrath has swept over me; your
terrors have destroyed me.
17All day long they surround me like a
flood; they have completely engulfed me.
18You have taken my companions and
loved ones from me; the darkness is my
closest friend.
PSALM 89
1I will sing of the Lord 's great love
forever; with my mouth I will make your
faithfulness known through all
generations.
2I will declare that your love stands firm
forever, that you established your
faithfulness in heaven itself.
3You said, "I have made a covenant with
my chosen one, I have sworn to David
my servant,
4'I will establish your line forever and
make your throne firm through all
generations.' " Selah
5The heavens praise your wonders, O
Lord , your faithfulness too, in the
assembly of the holy ones.
6For who in the skies above can
compare with the Lord ? Who is like the
Lord among the heavenly beings?
7In the council of the holy ones God is
greatly feared; he is more awesome
than all who surround him.
8O Lord God Almighty, who is like you?
You are mighty, O Lord , and your
faithfulness surrounds you.
9You rule over the surging sea; when its
waves mount up, you still them.
10You crushed Rahab like one of the
slain; with your strong arm you scattered
your enemies.
11The heavens are yours, and yours
also the earth; you founded the world
and all that is in it.
12You created the north and the south;
Tabor and Hermon sing for joy at your
name.
13Your arm is endued with power; your
hand is strong, your right hand exalted.
14Righteousness and justice are the
foundation of your throne; love and
faithfulness go before you.
15Blessed are those who have learned
to acclaim you, who walk in the light of
your presence, O Lord .
16They rejoice in your name all day long;
they exult in your righteousness.
17For you are their glory and strength,
and by your favor you exalt our horn.
18Indeed, our shield belongs to the Lord ,
our king to the Holy One of Israel.
19Once you spoke in a vision, to your
faithful people you said: "I have
bestowed strength on a warrior; I have
exalted a young man from among the
people.
20I have found David my servant; with
my sacred oil I have anointed him.
21My hand will sustain him; surely my
arm will strengthen him.
22No enemy will subject him to tribute;
no wicked man will oppress him.
23I will crush his foes before him and
strike down his adversaries.
24My faithful love will be with him, and
through my name his horn will be
exalted.
25I will set his hand over the sea, his
right hand over the rivers.
26He will call out to me, 'You are my
Father, my God, the Rock my Savior.'
27I will also appoint him my firstborn, the
most exalted of the kings of the earth.
28I will maintain my love to him forever,
and my covenant with him will never fail.
29I will establish his line forever, his
throne as long as the heavens endure.
30"If his sons forsake my law and do not
follow my statutes,
31if they violate my decrees and fail to
keep my commands,
32I will punish their sin with the rod, their
iniquity with flogging;
33but I will not take my love from him,
nor will I ever betray my faithfulness.
34I will not violate my covenant or alter
what my lips have uttered.
35Once for all, I have sworn by my
holiness- and I will not lie to David-
36that his line will continue forever and
his throne endure before me like the
sun;
37it will be established forever like the
moon, the faithful witness in the sky."
Selah
38But you have rejected, you have
spurned, you have been very angry with
your anointed one.
39You have renounced the covenant
with your servant and have defiled his
crown in the dust.
40You have broken through all his walls
and reduced his strongholds to ruins.
41All who pass by have plundered him;
he has become the scorn of his
neighbors.
42You have exalted the right hand of his
foes; you have made all his enemies
rejoice.
43You have turned back the edge of his
sword and have not supported him in
battle.
44You have put an end to his splendor
and cast his throne to the ground.
45You have cut short the days of his
youth; you have covered him with a
mantle of shame. Selah
46How long, O Lord ? Will you hide
yourself forever? How long will your
wrath burn like fire?
47Remember how fleeting is my life. For
what futility you have created all men!
48What man can live and not see death,
or save himself from the power of the
grave ? Selah
49O Lord, where is your former great
love, which in your faithfulness you
swore to David?
50Remember, Lord, how your servant
has been mocked, how I bear in my
heart the taunts of all the nations,
51the taunts with which your enemies
have mocked, O Lord , with which they
have mocked every step of your
anointed one.
52Praise be to the Lord forever! Amen
and Amen. BOOK IV Psalms 90-106
PSALM 90
1Lord, you have been our dwelling place
throughout all generations.
2Before the mountains were born or you
brought forth the earth and the world,
from everlasting to everlasting you are
God.
3You turn men back to dust, saying,
"Return to dust, O sons of men."
4For a thousand years in your sight are
like a day that has just gone by, or like a
watch in the night.
5You sweep men away in the sleep of
death; they are like the new grass of the
morning-
6though in the morning it springs up new,
by evening it is dry and withered.
7We are consumed by your anger and
terrified by your indignation.
8You have set our iniquities before you,
our secret sins in the light of your
presence.
9All our days pass away under your
wrath; we finish our years with a moan.
10The length of our days is seventy
years- or eighty, if we have the strength;
yet their span is but trouble and sorrow,
for they quickly pass, and we fly away.
11Who knows the power of your anger?
For your wrath is as great as the fear
that is due you.
12Teach us to number our days aright,
that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
13Relent, O Lord ! How long will it be?
Have compassion on your servants.
14Satisfy us in the morning with your
unfailing love, that we may sing for joy
and be glad all our days.
15Make us glad for as many days as you
have afflicted us, for as many years as
we have seen trouble.
16May your deeds be shown to your
servants, your splendor to their children.
17May the favor of the Lord our God rest
upon us; establish the work of our hands
for us- yes, establish the work of our
hands.
PSALM 91
1He who dwells in the shelter of the
Most High will rest in the shadow of the
Almighty.
2I will say of the Lord , "He is my refuge
and my fortress, my God, in whom I
trust."
3Surely he will save you from the
fowler's snare and from the deadly
pestilence.
4He will cover you with his feathers, and
under his wings you will find refuge; his
faithfulness will be your shield and
rampart.
5You will not fear the terror of night, nor
the arrow that flies by day,
6nor the pestilence that stalks in the
darkness, nor the plague that destroys
at midday.
7A thousand may fall at your side, ten
thousand at your right hand, but it will
not come near you.
8You will only observe with your eyes
and see the punishment of the wicked.
9If you make the Most High your
dwelling- even the Lord , who is my
refuge-
10then no harm will befall you, no
disaster will come near your tent.
11For he will command his angels
concerning you to guard you in all your
ways;
12they will lift you up in their hands, so
that you will not strike your foot against
a stone.
13You will tread upon the lion and the
cobra; you will trample the great lion and
the serpent.
14"Because he loves me," says the Lord ,
"I will rescue him; I will protect him, for
he acknowledges my name.
15He will call upon me, and I will answer
him; I will be with him in trouble, I will
deliver him and honor him.
16With long life will I satisfy him and
show him my salvation."
PSALM 92
1It is good to praise the Lord and make
music to your name, O Most High,
2to proclaim your love in the morning
and your faithfulness at night,
3to the music of the ten-stringed lyre and
the melody of the harp.
4For you make me glad by your deeds,
O Lord ; I sing for joy at the works of
your hands.
5How great are your works, O Lord ,
how profound your thoughts!
6The senseless man does not know,
fools do not understand,
7that though the wicked spring up like
grass and all evildoers flourish, they will
be forever destroyed.
8But you, O Lord , are exalted forever.
9For surely your enemies, O Lord ,
surely your enemies will perish; all
evildoers will be scattered.
10You have exalted my horn like that of
a wild ox; fine oils have been poured
upon me.
11My eyes have seen the defeat of my
adversaries; my ears have heard the
rout of my wicked foes.
12The righteous will flourish like a palm
tree, they will grow like a cedar of
Lebanon;
13planted in the house of the Lord , they
will flourish in the courts of our God.
14They will still bear fruit in old age, they
will stay fresh and green,
15proclaiming, "The Lord is upright; he is
my Rock, and there is no wickedness in
him."
PSALM 93
1The Lord reigns, he is robed in majesty;
the Lord is robed in majesty and is
armed with strength. The world is firmly
established; it cannot be moved.
2Your throne was established long ago;
you are from all eternity.
3The seas have lifted up, O Lord , the
seas have lifted up their voice; the seas
have lifted up their pounding waves.
4Mightier than the thunder of the great
waters, mightier than the breakers of the
sea- the Lord on high is mighty.
5Your statutes stand firm; holiness
adorns your house for endless days, O
Lord .
PSALM 94
1O Lord , the God who avenges, O God
who avenges, shine forth.
2Rise up, O Judge of the earth; pay back
to the proud what they deserve.
3How long will the wicked, O Lord , how
long will the wicked be jubilant?
4They pour out arrogant words; all the
evildoers are full of boasting.
5They crush your people, O Lord ; they
oppress your inheritance.
6They slay the widow and the alien; they
murder the fatherless.
7They say, "The Lord does not see; the
God of Jacob pays no heed."
8Take heed, you senseless ones among
the people; you fools, when will you
become wise?
9Does he who implanted the ear not
hear? Does he who formed the eye not
see?
10Does he who disciplines nations not
punish? Does he who teaches man lack
knowledge?
11The Lord knows the thoughts of man;
he knows that they are futile.
12Blessed is the man you discipline, O
Lord , the man you teach from your law;
13you grant him relief from days of
trouble, till a pit is dug for the wicked.
14For the Lord will not reject his people;
he will never forsake his inheritance.
15Judgment will again be founded on
righteousness, and all the upright in
heart will follow it.
16Who will rise up for me against the
wicked? Who will take a stand for me
against evildoers?
17Unless the Lord had given me help, I
would soon have dwelt in the silence of
death.
18When I said, "My foot is slipping," your
love, O Lord , supported me.
19When anxiety was great within me,
your consolation brought joy to my soul.
20Can a corrupt throne be allied with
you- one that brings on misery by its
decrees?
21They band together against the
righteous and condemn the innocent to
death.
22But the Lord has become my fortress,
and my God the rock in whom I take
refuge.
23He will repay them for their sins and
destroy them for their wickedness; the
Lord our God will destroy them.
PSALM 95
1Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord ;
let us shout aloud to the Rock of our
salvation.
2Let us come before him with
thanksgiving and extol him with music
and song.
3For the Lord is the great God, the great
King above all gods.
4In his hand are the depths of the earth,
and the mountain peaks belong to him.
5The sea is his, for he made it, and his
hands formed the dry land.
6Come, let us bow down in worship, let
us kneel before the Lord our Maker;
7for he is our God and we are the people
of his pasture, the flock under his care.
Today, if you hear his voice,
8do not harden your hearts as you did at
Meribah, as you did that day at Massah
in the desert,
9where your fathers tested and tried me,
though they had seen what I did.
10For forty years I was angry with that
generation; I said, "They are a people
whose hearts go astray, and they have
not known my ways."
11So I declared on oath in my anger,
"They shall never enter my rest."
PSALM 96
1Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the
Lord , all the earth.
2Sing to the Lord , praise his name;
proclaim his salvation day after day.
3Declare his glory among the nations,
his marvelous deeds among all peoples.
4For great is the Lord and most worthy
of praise; he is to be feared above all
gods.
5For all the gods of the nations are idols,
but the Lord made the heavens.
6Splendor and majesty are before him;
strength and glory are in his sanctuary.
7Ascribe to the Lord , O families of
nations, ascribe to the Lord glory and
strength.
8Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his
name; bring an offering and come into
his courts.
9Worship the Lord in the splendor of his
holiness; tremble before him, all the
earth.
10Say among the nations, "The Lord
reigns." The world is firmly established,
it cannot be moved; he will judge the
peoples with equity.
11Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth
be glad; let the sea resound, and all that
is in it;
12let the fields be jubilant, and
everything in them. Then all the trees of
the forest will sing for joy;
13they will sing before the Lord , for he
comes, he comes to judge the earth. He
will judge the world in righteousness and
the peoples in his truth.
PSALM 97
1The Lord reigns, let the earth be glad;
let the distant shores rejoice.
2Clouds and thick darkness surround
him; righteousness and justice are the
foundation of his throne.
3Fire goes before him and consumes his
foes on every side.
4His lightning lights up the world; the
earth sees and trembles.
5The mountains melt like wax before the
Lord , before the Lord of all the earth.
6The heavens proclaim his
righteousness, and all the peoples see
his glory.
7All who worship images are put to
shame, those who boast in idolsworship
him, all you gods!
8Zion hears and rejoices and the villages
of Judah are glad because of your
judgments, O Lord .
9For you, O Lord , are the Most High
over all the earth; you are exalted far
above all gods.
10Let those who love the Lord hate evil,
for he guards the lives of his faithful
ones and delivers them from the hand of
the wicked.
11Light is shed upon the righteous and
joy on the upright in heart.
12Rejoice in the Lord , you who are
righteous, and praise his holy name.
PSALM 98
1Sing to the Lord a new song, for he has
done marvelous things; his right hand
and his holy arm have worked salvation
for him.
2The Lord has made his salvation known
and revealed his righteousness to the
nations.
3He has remembered his love and his
faithfulness to the house of Israel; all the
ends of the earth have seen the
salvation of our God.
4Shout for joy to the Lord , all the earth,
burst into jubilant song with music;
5make music to the Lord with the harp,
with the harp and the sound of singing,
6with trumpets and the blast of the ram's
horn- shout for joy before the Lord , the
King.
7Let the sea resound, and everything in
it, the world, and all who live in it.
8Let the rivers clap their hands,
9let them sing before the Lord , for he
comes to judge the earth. He will judge
the world in righteousness and the
peoples with equity.
PSALM 99
1The Lord reigns, let the nations
tremble; he sits enthroned between the
cherubim, let the earth shake.
2Great is the Lord in Zion; he is exalted
over all the nations.
3Let them praise your great and
awesome name- he is holy.
4The King is mighty, he loves justiceyou
have established equity; in Jacob
you have done what is just and right.
5Exalt the Lord our God and worship at
his footstool; he is holy.
6Moses and Aaron were among his
priests, Samuel was among those who
called on his name; they called on the
Lord and he answered them.
7He spoke to them from the pillar of
cloud; they kept his statutes and the
decrees he gave them.
8O Lord our God, you answered them;
you were to Israel a forgiving God,
though you punished their misdeeds.
9Exalt the Lord our God and worship at
his holy mountain, for the Lord our God
is holy.
PSALM 100
1Shout for joy to the Lord , all the earth.
2Worship the Lord with gladness; come
before him with joyful songs.
3Know that the Lord is God. It is he who
made us, and we are his ; we are his
people, the sheep of his pasture.
4Enter his gates with thanksgiving and
his courts with praise; give thanks to him
and praise his name.
5For the Lord is good and his love
endures forever; his faithfulness
continues through all generations.
PSALM 101
1I will sing of your love and justice; to
you, O Lord , I will sing praise.
2I will be careful to lead a blameless lifewhen
will you come to me? I will walk in
my house with blameless heart.
3I will set before my eyes no vile thing.
The deeds of faithless men I hate; they
will not cling to me.
4Men of perverse heart shall be far from
me; I will have nothing to do with evil.
5Whoever slanders his neighbor in
secret, him will I put to silence; whoever
has haughty eyes and a proud heart,
him will I not endure.
6My eyes will be on the faithful in the
land, that they may dwell with me; he
whose walk is blameless will minister to
me.
7No one who practices deceit will dwell
in my house; no one who speaks falsely
will stand in my presence.
8Every morning I will put to silence all
the wicked in the land; I will cut off every
evildoer from the city of the Lord .
PSALM 102
1Hear my prayer, O Lord ; let my cry for
help come to you.
2Do not hide your face from me when I
am in distress. Turn your ear to me;
when I call, answer me quickly.
3For my days vanish like smoke; my
bones burn like glowing embers.
4My heart is blighted and withered like
grass; I forget to eat my food.
5Because of my loud groaning I am
reduced to skin and bones.
6I am like a desert owl, like an owl
among the ruins.
7I lie awake; I have become like a bird
alone on a roof.
8All day long my enemies taunt me;
those who rail against me use my name
as a curse.
9For I eat ashes as my food and mingle
my drink with tears
10because of your great wrath, for you
have taken me up and thrown me aside.
11My days are like the evening shadow; I
wither away like grass.
12But you, O Lord , sit enthroned
forever; your renown endures through
all generations.
13You will arise and have compassion
on Zion, for it is time to show favor to
her; the appointed time has come.
14For her stones are dear to your
servants; her very dust moves them to
pity.
15The nations will fear the name of the
Lord , all the kings of the earth will
revere your glory.
16For the Lord will rebuild Zion and
appear in his glory.
17He will respond to the prayer of the
destitute; he will not despise their plea.
18Let this be written for a future
generation, that a people not yet created
may praise the Lord :
19"The Lord looked down from his
sanctuary on high, from heaven he
viewed the earth,
20to hear the groans of the prisoners and
release those condemned to death."
21So the name of the Lord will be
declared in Zion and his praise in
Jerusalem
22when the peoples and the kingdoms
assemble to worship the Lord .
23In the course of my life he broke my
strength; he cut short my days.
24So I said: "Do not take me away, O my
God, in the midst of my days; your years
go on through all generations.
25In the beginning you laid the
foundations of the earth, and the
heavens are the work of your hands.
26They will perish, but you remain; they
will all wear out like a garment. Like
clothing you will change them and they
will be discarded.
27But you remain the same, and your
years will never end.
28The children of your servants will live
in your presence; their descendants will
be established before you."
PSALM 103
1Praise the Lord , O my soul; all my
inmost being, praise his holy name.
2Praise the Lord , O my soul, and forget
not all his benefits-
3who forgives all your sins and heals all
your diseases,
4who redeems your life from the pit and
crowns you with love and compassion,
5who satisfies your desires with good
things so that your youth is renewed like
the eagle's.
6The Lord works righteousness and
justice for all the oppressed.
7He made known his ways to Moses, his
deeds to the people of Israel:
8The Lord is compassionate and
gracious, slow to anger, abounding in
love.
9He will not always accuse, nor will he
harbor his anger forever;
10he does not treat us as our sins
deserve or repay us according to our
iniquities.
11For as high as the heavens are above
the earth, so great is his love for those
who fear him;
12as far as the east is from the west, so
far has he removed our transgressions
from us.
13As a father has compassion on his
children, so the Lord has compassion on
those who fear him;
14for he knows how we are formed, he
remembers that we are dust.
15As for man, his days are like grass, he
flourishes like a flower of the field;
16the wind blows over it and it is gone,
and its place remembers it no more.
17But from everlasting to everlasting the
Lord 's love is with those who fear him,
and his righteousness with their
children's children-
18with those who keep his covenant and
remember to obey his precepts.
19The Lord has established his throne in
heaven, and his kingdom rules over all.
20Praise the Lord , you his angels, you
mighty ones who do his bidding, who
obey his word.
21Praise the Lord , all his heavenly hosts,
you his servants who do his will.
22Praise the Lord , all his works
everywhere in his dominion. Praise the
Lord , O my soul.
PSALM 104
1Praise the Lord , O my soul. O Lord my
God, you are very great; you are clothed
with splendor and majesty.
2He wraps himself in light as with a
garment; he stretches out the heavens
like a tent
3and lays the beams of his upper
chambers on their waters. He makes the
clouds his chariot and rides on the
wings of the wind.
4He makes winds his messengers,
flames of fire his servants.
5He set the earth on its foundations; it
can never be moved.
6You covered it with the deep as with a
garment; the waters stood above the
mountains.
7But at your rebuke the waters fled, at
the sound of your thunder they took to
flight;
8they flowed over the mountains, they
went down into the valleys, to the place
you assigned for them.
9You set a boundary they cannot cross;
never again will they cover the earth.
10He makes springs pour water into the
ravines; it flows between the mountains.
11They give water to all the beasts of the
field; the wild donkeys quench their
thirst.
12The birds of the air nest by the waters;
they sing among the branches.
13He waters the mountains from his
upper chambers; the earth is satisfied
by the fruit of his work.
14He makes grass grow for the cattle,
and plants for man to cultivate- bringing
forth food from the earth:
15wine that gladdens the heart of man,
oil to make his face shine, and bread
that sustains his heart.
16The trees of the Lord are well watered,
the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.
17There the birds make their nests; the
stork has its home in the pine trees.
18The high mountains belong to the wild
goats; the crags are a refuge for the
coneys.
19The moon marks off the seasons, and
the sun knows when to go down.
20You bring darkness, it becomes night,
and all the beasts of the forest prowl.
21The lions roar for their prey and seek
their food from God.
22The sun rises, and they steal away;
they return and lie down in their dens.
23Then man goes out to his work, to his
labor until evening.
24How many are your works, O Lord ! In
wisdom you made them all; the earth is
full of your creatures.
25There is the sea, vast and spacious,
teeming with creatures beyond numberliving
things both large and small.
26There the ships go to and fro, and the
leviathan, which you formed to frolic
there.
27These all look to you to give them their
food at the proper time.
28When you give it to them, they gather
it up; when you open your hand, they
are satisfied with good things.
29When you hide your face, they are
terrified; when you take away their
breath, they die and return to the dust.
30When you send your Spirit, they are
created, and you renew the face of the
earth.
31May the glory of the Lord endure
forever; may the Lord rejoice in his
works-
32he who looks at the earth, and it
trembles, who touches the mountains,
and they smoke.
33I will sing to the Lord all my life; I will
sing praise to my God as long as I live.
34May my meditation be pleasing to him,
as I rejoice in the Lord .
35But may sinners vanish from the earth
and the wicked be no more. Praise the
Lord , O my soul. Praise the Lord .
PSALM 105
1Give thanks to the Lord , call on his
name; make known among the nations
what he has done.
2Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all
his wonderful acts.
3Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of
those who seek the Lord rejoice.
4Look to the Lord and his strength; seek
his face always.
5Remember the wonders he has done,
his miracles, and the judgments he
pronounced,
6O descendants of Abraham his servant,
O sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.
7He is the Lord our God; his judgments
are in all the earth.
8He remembers his covenant forever,
the word he commanded, for a thousand
generations,
9the covenant he made with Abraham,
the oath he swore to Isaac.
10He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,
to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
11"To you I will give the land of Canaan
as the portion you will inherit."
12When they were but few in number,
few indeed, and strangers in it,
13they wandered from nation to nation,
from one kingdom to another.
14He allowed no one to oppress them;
for their sake he rebuked kings:
15"Do not touch my anointed ones; do
my prophets no harm."
16He called down famine on the land
and destroyed all their supplies of food;
17and he sent a man before them-
Joseph, sold as a slave.
18They bruised his feet with shackles,
his neck was put in irons,
19till what he foretold came to pass, till
the word of the Lord proved him true.
20The king sent and released him, the
ruler of peoples set him free.
21He made him master of his household,
ruler over all he possessed,
22to instruct his princes as he pleased
and teach his elders wisdom.
23Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob lived
as an alien in the land of Ham.
24The Lord made his people very fruitful;
he made them too numerous for their
foes,
25whose hearts he turned to hate his
people, to conspire against his servants.
26He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron,
whom he had chosen.
27They performed his miraculous signs
among them, his wonders in the land of
Ham.
28He sent darkness and made the land
dark- for had they not rebelled against
his words?
29He turned their waters into blood,
causing their fish to die.
30Their land teemed with frogs, which
went up into the bedrooms of their rulers.
31He spoke, and there came swarms of
flies, and gnats throughout their country.
32He turned their rain into hail, with
lightning throughout their land;
33he struck down their vines and fig
trees and shattered the trees of their
country.
34He spoke, and the locusts came,
grasshoppers without number;
35they ate up every green thing in their
land, ate up the produce of their soil.
36Then he struck down all the firstborn in
their land, the firstfruits of all their
manhood.
37He brought out Israel, laden with silver
and gold, and from among their tribes
no one faltered.
38Egypt was glad when they left,
because dread of Israel had fallen on
them.
39He spread out a cloud as a covering,
and a fire to give light at night.
40They asked, and he brought them
quail and satisfied them with the bread
of heaven.
41He opened the rock, and water gushed
out; like a river it flowed in the desert.
42For he remembered his holy promise
given to his servant Abraham.
43He brought out his people with
rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of
joy;
44he gave them the lands of the nations,
and they fell heir to what others had
toiled for-
45that they might keep his precepts and
observe his laws. Praise the Lord .
PSALM 106
1Praise the Lord . Give thanks to the
Lord , for he is good; his love endures
forever.
2Who can proclaim the mighty acts of
the Lord or fully declare his praise?
3Blessed are they who maintain justice,
who constantly do what is right.
4Remember me, O Lord , when you
show favor to your people, come to my
aid when you save them,
5that I may enjoy the prosperity of your
chosen ones, that I may share in the joy
of your nation and join your inheritance
in giving praise.
6We have sinned, even as our fathers
did; we have done wrong and acted
wickedly.
7When our fathers were in Egypt, they
gave no thought to your miracles; they
did not remember your many
kindnesses, and they rebelled by the
sea, the Red Sea.
8Yet he saved them for his name's sake,
to make his mighty power known.
9He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried
up; he led them through the depths as
through a desert.
10He saved them from the hand of the
foe; from the hand of the enemy he
redeemed them.
11The waters covered their adversaries;
not one of them survived.
12Then they believed his promises and
sang his praise.
13But they soon forgot what he had done
and did not wait for his counsel.
14In the desert they gave in to their
craving; in the wasteland they put God
to the test.
15So he gave them what they asked for,
but sent a wasting disease upon them.
16In the camp they grew envious of
Moses and of Aaron, who was
consecrated to the Lord .
17The earth opened up and swallowed
Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram.
18Fire blazed among their followers; a
flame consumed the wicked.
19At Horeb they made a calf and
worshiped an idol cast from metal.
20They exchanged their Glory for an
image of a bull, which eats grass.
21They forgot the God who saved them,
who had done great things in Egypt,
22miracles in the land of Ham and
awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
23So he said he would destroy themhad
not Moses, his chosen one, stood in
the breach before him to keep his wrath
from destroying them.
24Then they despised the pleasant land;
they did not believe his promise.
25They grumbled in their tents and did
not obey the Lord .
26So he swore to them with uplifted hand
that he would make them fall in the
desert,
27make their descendants fall among the
nations and scatter them throughout the
lands.
28They yoked themselves to the Baal of
Peor and ate sacrifices offered to
lifeless gods;
29they provoked the Lord to anger by
their wicked deeds, and a plague broke
out among them.
30But Phinehas stood up and intervened,
and the plague was checked.
31This was credited to him as
righteousness for endless generations
to come.
32By the waters of Meribah they angered
the Lord , and trouble came to Moses
because of them;
33for they rebelled against the Spirit of
God, and rash words came from Moses'
lips.
34They did not destroy the peoples as
the Lord had commanded them,
35but they mingled with the nations and
adopted their customs.
36They worshiped their idols, which
became a snare to them.
37They sacrificed their sons and their
daughters to demons.
38They shed innocent blood, the blood of
their sons and daughters, whom they
sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and
the land was desecrated by their blood.
39They defiled themselves by what they
did; by their deeds they prostituted
themselves.
40Therefore the Lord was angry with his
people and abhorred his inheritance.
41He handed them over to the nations,
and their foes ruled over them.
42Their enemies oppressed them and
subjected them to their power.
43Many times he delivered them, but
they were bent on rebellion and they
wasted away in their sin.
44But he took note of their distress when
he heard their cry;
45for their sake he remembered his
covenant and out of his great love he
relented.
46He caused them to be pitied by all who
held them captive.
47Save us, O Lord our God, and gather
us from the nations, that we may give
thanks to your holy name and glory in
your praise.
48Praise be to the Lord , the God of
Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.
Let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise
the Lord .
PSALM 107
1Give thanks to the Lord , for he is good;
his love endures forever.
2Let the redeemed of the Lord say thisthose
he redeemed from the hand of the
foe,
3those he gathered from the lands, from
east and west, from north and south.
4Some wandered in desert wastelands,
finding no way to a city where they could
settle.
5They were hungry and thirsty, and their
lives ebbed away.
6Then they cried out to the Lord in their
trouble, and he delivered them from
their distress.
7He led them by a straight way to a city
where they could settle.
8Let them give thanks to the Lord for his
unfailing love and his wonderful deeds
for men,
9for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the
hungry with good things.
10Some sat in darkness and the deepest
gloom, prisoners suffering in iron chains,
11for they had rebelled against the words
of God and despised the counsel of the
Most High.
12So he subjected them to bitter labor;
they stumbled, and there was no one to
help.
13Then they cried to the Lord in their
trouble, and he saved them from their
distress.
14He brought them out of darkness and
the deepest gloom and broke away their
chains.
15Let them give thanks to the Lord for
his unfailing love and his wonderful
deeds for men,
16for he breaks down gates of bronze
and cuts through bars of iron.
17Some became fools through their
rebellious ways and suffered affliction
because of their iniquities.
18They loathed all food and drew near
the gates of death.
19Then they cried to the Lord in their
trouble, and he saved them from their
distress.
20He sent forth his word and healed
them; he rescued them from the grave.
21Let them give thanks to the Lord for
his unfailing love and his wonderful
deeds for men.
22Let them sacrifice thank offerings and
tell of his works with songs of joy.
23Others went out on the sea in ships;
they were merchants on the mighty
waters.
24They saw the works of the Lord , his
wonderful deeds in the deep.
25For he spoke and stirred up a tempest
that lifted high the waves.
26They mounted up to the heavens and
went down to the depths; in their peril
their courage melted away.
27They reeled and staggered like
drunken men; they were at their wits'
end.
28Then they cried out to the Lord in their
trouble, and he brought them out of their
distress.
29He stilled the storm to a whisper; the
waves of the sea were hushed.
30They were glad when it grew calm,
and he guided them to their desired
haven.
31Let them give thanks to the Lord for
his unfailing love and his wonderful
deeds for men.
32Let them exalt him in the assembly of
the people and praise him in the council
of the elders.
33He turned rivers into a desert, flowing
springs into thirsty ground,
34and fruitful land into a salt waste,
because of the wickedness of those who
lived there.
35He turned the desert into pools of
water and the parched ground into
flowing springs;
36there he brought the hungry to live,
and they founded a city where they
could settle.
37They sowed fields and planted
vineyards that yielded a fruitful harvest;
38he blessed them, and their numbers
greatly increased, and he did not let
their herds diminish.
39Then their numbers decreased, and
they were humbled by oppression,
calamity and sorrow;
40he who pours contempt on nobles
made them wander in a trackless waste.
41But he lifted the needy out of their
affliction and increased their families like
flocks.
42The upright see and rejoice, but all the
wicked shut their mouths.
43Whoever is wise, let him heed these
things and consider the great love of the
Lord .
PSALM 108
1My heart is steadfast, O God; I will sing
and make music with all my soul.
2Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the
dawn.
3I will praise you, O Lord , among the
nations; I will sing of you among the
peoples.
4For great is your love, higher than the
heavens; your faithfulness reaches to
the skies.
5Be exalted, O God, above the heavens,
and let your glory be over all the earth.
6Save us and help us with your right
hand, that those you love may be
delivered.
7God has spoken from his sanctuary: "In
triumph I will parcel out Shechem and
measure off the Valley of Succoth.
8Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine;
Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my
scepter.
9Moab is my washbasin, upon Edom I
toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in
triumph."
10Who will bring me to the fortified city?
Who will lead me to Edom?
11Is it not you, O God, you who have
rejected us and no longer go out with
our armies?
12Give us aid against the enemy, for the
help of man is worthless.
13With God we will gain the victory, and
he will trample down our enemies.
PSALM 109
1O God, whom I praise, do not remain
silent,
2for wicked and deceitful men have
opened their mouths against me; they
have spoken against me with lying
tongues.
3With words of hatred they surround me;
they attack me without cause.
4In return for my friendship they accuse
me, but I am a man of prayer.
5They repay me evil for good, and
hatred for my friendship.
6Appoint an evil man to oppose him; let
an accuser stand at his right hand.
7When he is tried, let him be found guilty,
and may his prayers condemn him.
8May his days be few; may another take
his place of leadership.
9May his children be fatherless and his
wife a widow.
10May his children be wandering
beggars; may they be driven from their
ruined homes.
11May a creditor seize all he has; may
strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.
12May no one extend kindness to him or
take pity on his fatherless children.
13May his descendants be cut off, their
names blotted out from the next
generation.
14May the iniquity of his fathers be
remembered before the Lord ; may the
sin of his mother never be blotted out.
15May their sins always remain before
the Lord , that he may cut off the
memory of them from the earth.
16For he never thought of doing a
kindness, but hounded to death the poor
and the needy and the brokenhearted.
17He loved to pronounce a curse- may it
come on him; he found no pleasure in
blessing- may it be far from him.
18He wore cursing as his garment; it
entered into his body like water, into his
bones like oil.
19May it be like a cloak wrapped about
him, like a belt tied forever around him.
20May this be the Lord 's payment to my
accusers, to those who speak evil of me.
21But you, O Sovereign Lord , deal well
with me for your name's sake; out of the
goodness of your love, deliver me.
22For I am poor and needy, and my
heart is wounded within me.
23I fade away like an evening shadow; I
am shaken off like a locust.
24My knees give way from fasting; my
body is thin and gaunt.
25I am an object of scorn to my
accusers; when they see me, they
shake their heads.
26Help me, O Lord my God; save me in
accordance with your love.
27Let them know that it is your hand, that
you, O Lord , have done it.
28They may curse, but you will bless;
when they attack they will be put to
shame, but your servant will rejoice.
29My accusers will be clothed with
disgrace and wrapped in shame as in a
cloak.
30With my mouth I will greatly extol the
Lord ; in the great throng I will praise
him.
31For he stands at the right hand of the
needy one, to save his life from those
who condemn him.
PSALM 110
1The Lord says to my Lord: "Sit at my
right hand until I make your enemies a
footstool for your feet."
2The Lord will extend your mighty
scepter from Zion; you will rule in the
midst of your enemies.
3Your troops will be willing on your day
of battle. Arrayed in holy majesty, from
the womb of the dawn you will receive
the dew of your youth.
4The Lord has sworn and will not
change his mind: "You are a priest
forever, in the order of Melchizedek."
5The Lord is at your right hand; he will
crush kings on the day of his wrath.
6He will judge the nations, heaping up
the dead and crushing the rulers of the
whole earth.
7He will drink from a brook beside the
way ; therefore he will lift up his head.
PSALM 111
1Praise the Lord . I will extol the Lord
with all my heart in the council of the
upright and in the assembly.
2Great are the works of the Lord ; they
are pondered by all who delight in them.
3Glorious and majestic are his deeds,
and his righteousness endures forever.
4He has caused his wonders to be
remembered; the Lord is gracious and
compassionate.
5He provides food for those who fear
him; he remembers his covenant forever.
6He has shown his people the power of
his works, giving them the lands of other
nations.
7The works of his hands are faithful and
just; all his precepts are trustworthy.
8They are steadfast for ever and ever,
done in faithfulness and uprightness.
9He provided redemption for his people;
he ordained his covenant forever- holy
and awesome is his name.
10The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
wisdom; all who follow his precepts
have good understanding. To him
belongs eternal praise.
PSALM 112
1Praise the Lord . Blessed is the man
who fears the Lord , who finds great
delight in his commands.
2His children will be mighty in the land;
the generation of the upright will be
blessed.
3Wealth and riches are in his house, and
his righteousness endures forever.
4Even in darkness light dawns for the
upright, for the gracious and
compassionate and righteous man.
5Good will come to him who is generous
and lends freely, who conducts his
affairs with justice.
6Surely he will never be shaken; a
righteous man will be remembered
forever.
7He will have no fear of bad news; his
heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord .
8His heart is secure, he will have no
fear; in the end he will look in triumph on
his foes.
9He has scattered abroad his gifts to the
poor, his righteousness endures forever;
his horn will be lifted high in honor.
10The wicked man will see and be vexed,
he will gnash his teeth and waste away;
the longings of the wicked will come to
nothing.
PSALM 113
1Praise the Lord . Praise, O servants of
the Lord , praise the name of the Lord .
2Let the name of the Lord be praised,
both now and forevermore.
3From the rising of the sun to the place
where it sets, the name of the Lord is to
be praised.
4The Lord is exalted over all the nations,
his glory above the heavens.
5Who is like the Lord our God, the One
who sits enthroned on high,
6who stoops down to look on the
heavens and the earth?
7He raises the poor from the dust and
lifts the needy from the ash heap;
8he seats them with princes, with the
princes of their people.
9He settles the barren woman in her
home as a happy mother of children.
Praise the Lord .
PSALM 114
1When Israel came out of Egypt, the
house of Jacob from a people of foreign
tongue,
2Judah became God's sanctuary, Israel
his dominion.
3The sea looked and fled, the Jordan
turned back;
4the mountains skipped like rams, the
hills like lambs.
5Why was it, O sea, that you fled, O
Jordan, that you turned back,
6you mountains, that you skipped like
rams, you hills, like lambs?
7Tremble, O earth, at the presence of
the Lord, at the presence of the God of
Jacob,
8who turned the rock into a pool, the
hard rock into springs of water.
PSALM 115
1Not to us, O Lord , not to us but to your
name be the glory, because of your love
and faithfulness.
2Why do the nations say, "Where is their
God?"
3Our God is in heaven; he does
whatever pleases him.
4But their idols are silver and gold, made
by the hands of men.
5They have mouths, but cannot speak,
eyes, but they cannot see;
6they have ears, but cannot hear, noses,
but they cannot smell;
7they have hands, but cannot feel, feet,
but they cannot walk; nor can they utter
a sound with their throats.
8Those who make them will be like them,
and so will all who trust in them.
9O house of Israel, trust in the Lord - he
is their help and shield.
10O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord -
he is their help and shield.
11You who fear him, trust in the Lord -
he is their help and shield.
12The Lord remembers us and will bless
us: He will bless the house of Israel, he
will bless the house of Aaron,
13he will bless those who fear the Lord -
small and great alike.
14May the Lord make you increase, both
you and your children.
15May you be blessed by the Lord , the
Maker of heaven and earth.
16The highest heavens belong to the
Lord , but the earth he has given to man.
17It is not the dead who praise the Lord ,
those who go down to silence;
18it is we who extol the Lord , both now
and forevermore. Praise the Lord .
PSALM 116
1I love the Lord , for he heard my voice;
he heard my cry for mercy.
2Because he turned his ear to me, I will
call on him as long as I live.
3The cords of death entangled me, the
anguish of the grave came upon me; I
was overcome by trouble and sorrow.
4Then I called on the name of the Lord :
"O Lord , save me!"
5The Lord is gracious and righteous; our
God is full of compassion.
6The Lord protects the simplehearted;
when I was in great need, he saved me.
7Be at rest once more, O my soul, for
the Lord has been good to you.
8For you, O Lord , have delivered my
soul from death, my eyes from tears, my
feet from stumbling,
9that I may walk before the Lord in the
land of the living.
10I believed; therefore I said, "I am
greatly afflicted."
11And in my dismay I said, "All men are
liars."
12How can I repay the Lord for all his
goodness to me?
13I will lift up the cup of salvation and call
on the name of the Lord .
14I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the
presence of all his people.
15Precious in the sight of the Lord is the
death of his saints.
16O Lord , truly I am your servant; I am
your servant, the son of your
maidservant ; you have freed me from
my chains.
17I will sacrifice a thank offering to you
and call on the name of the Lord .
18I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the
presence of all his people,
19in the courts of the house of the Lord -
in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the
Lord .
PSALM 117
1Praise the Lord , all you nations; extol
him, all you peoples.
2For great is his love toward us, and the
faithfulness of the Lord endures forever.
Praise the Lord .
PSALM 118
1Give thanks to the Lord , for he is good;
his love endures forever.
2Let Israel say: "His love endures
forever."
3Let the house of Aaron say: "His love
endures forever."
4Let those who fear the Lord say: "His
love endures forever."
5In my anguish I cried to the Lord , and
he answered by setting me free.
6The Lord is with me; I will not be afraid.
What can man do to me?
7The Lord is with me; he is my helper. I
will look in triumph on my enemies.
8It is better to take refuge in the Lord
than to trust in man.
9It is better to take refuge in the Lord
than to trust in princes.
10All the nations surrounded me, but in
the name of the Lord I cut them off.
11They surrounded me on every side,
but in the name of the Lord I cut them
off.
12They swarmed around me like bees,
but they died out as quickly as burning
thorns; in the name of the Lord I cut
them off.
13I was pushed back and about to fall,
but the Lord helped me.
14The Lord is my strength and my song;
he has become my salvation.
15Shouts of joy and victory resound in
the tents of the righteous: "The Lord 's
right hand has done mighty things!
16The Lord 's right hand is lifted high; the
Lord 's right hand has done mighty
things!"
17I will not die but live, and will proclaim
what the Lord has done.
18The Lord has chastened me severely,
but he has not given me over to death.
19Open for me the gates of
righteousness; I will enter and give
thanks to the Lord .
20This is the gate of the Lord through
which the righteous may enter.
21I will give you thanks, for you
answered me; you have become my
salvation.
22The stone the builders rejected has
become the capstone;
23the Lord has done this, and it is
marvelous in our eyes.
24This is the day the Lord has made; let
us rejoice and be glad in it.
25O Lord , save us; O Lord , grant us
success.
26Blessed is he who comes in the name
of the Lord . From the house of the Lord
we bless you.
27The Lord is God, and he has made his
light shine upon us. With boughs in
hand, join in the festal procession up to
the horns of the altar.
28You are my God, and I will give you
thanks; you are my God, and I will exalt
you.
29Give thanks to the Lord , for he is
good; his love endures forever.
PSALM 119
1Blessed are they whose ways are
blameless, who walk according to the
law of the Lord .
2Blessed are they who keep his statutes
and seek him with all their heart.
3They do nothing wrong; they walk in his
ways.
4You have laid down precepts that are to
be fully obeyed.
5Oh, that my ways were steadfast in
obeying your decrees!
6Then I would not be put to shame when
I consider all your commands.
7I will praise you with an upright heart as
I learn your righteous laws.
8I will obey your decrees; do not utterly
forsake me.
9How can a young man keep his way
pure? By living according to your word.
10I seek you with all my heart; do not let
me stray from your commands.
11I have hidden your word in my heart
that I might not sin against you.
12Praise be to you, O Lord ; teach me
your decrees.
13With my lips I recount all the laws that
come from your mouth.
14I rejoice in following your statutes as
one rejoices in great riches.
15I meditate on your precepts and
consider your ways.
16I delight in your decrees; I will not
neglect your word.
17Do good to your servant, and I will live;
I will obey your word.
18Open my eyes that I may see
wonderful things in your law.
19I am a stranger on earth; do not hide
your commands from me.
20My soul is consumed with longing for
your laws at all times.
21You rebuke the arrogant, who are
cursed and who stray from your
commands.
22Remove from me scorn and contempt,
for I keep your statutes.
23Though rulers sit together and slander
me, your servant will meditate on your
decrees.
24Your statutes are my delight; they are
my counselors.
25I am laid low in the dust; preserve my
life according to your word.
26I recounted my ways and you
answered me; teach me your decrees.
27Let me understand the teaching of
your precepts; then I will meditate on
your wonders.
28My soul is weary with sorrow;
strengthen me according to your word.
29Keep me from deceitful ways; be
gracious to me through your law.
30I have chosen the way of truth; I have
set my heart on your laws.
31I hold fast to your statutes, O Lord ; do
not let me be put to shame.
32I run in the path of your commands, for
you have set my heart free.
33Teach me, O Lord , to follow your
decrees; then I will keep them to the end.
34Give me understanding, and I will keep
your law and obey it with all my heart.
35Direct me in the path of your
commands, for there I find delight.
36Turn my heart toward your statutes
and not toward selfish gain.
37Turn my eyes away from worthless
things; preserve my life according to
your word.
38Fulfill your promise to your servant, so
that you may be feared.
39Take away the disgrace I dread, for
your laws are good.
40How I long for your precepts! Preserve
my life in your righteousness.
41May your unfailing love come to me, O
Lord , your salvation according to your
promise;
42then I will answer the one who taunts
me, for I trust in your word.
43Do not snatch the word of truth from
my mouth, for I have put my hope in
your laws.
44I will always obey your law, for ever
and ever.
45I will walk about in freedom, for I have
sought out your precepts.
46I will speak of your statutes before
kings and will not be put to shame,
47for I delight in your commands
because I love them.
48I lift up my hands to your commands,
which I love, and I meditate on your
decrees.
49Remember your word to your servant,
for you have given me hope.
50My comfort in my suffering is this: Your
promise preserves my life.
51The arrogant mock me without
restraint, but I do not turn from your law.
52I remember your ancient laws, O Lord ,
and I find comfort in them.
53Indignation grips me because of the
wicked, who have forsaken your law.
54Your decrees are the theme of my
song wherever I lodge.
55In the night I remember your name, O
Lord , and I will keep your law.
56This has been my practice: I obey your
precepts.
57You are my portion, O Lord ; I have
promised to obey your words.
58I have sought your face with all my
heart; be gracious to me according to
your promise.
59I have considered my ways and have
turned my steps to your statutes.
60I will hasten and not delay to obey
your commands.
61Though the wicked bind me with ropes,
I will not forget your law.
62At midnight I rise to give you thanks for
your righteous laws.
63I am a friend to all who fear you, to all
who follow your precepts.
64The earth is filled with your love, O
Lord ; teach me your decrees.
65Do good to your servant according to
your word, O Lord .
66Teach me knowledge and good
judgment, for I believe in your
commands.
67Before I was afflicted I went astray, but
now I obey your word.
68You are good, and what you do is
good; teach me your decrees.
69Though the arrogant have smeared
me with lies, I keep your precepts with
all my heart.
70Their hearts are callous and unfeeling,
but I delight in your law.
71It was good for me to be afflicted so
that I might learn your decrees.
72The law from your mouth is more
precious to me than thousands of pieces
of silver and gold.
73Your hands made me and formed me;
give me understanding to learn your
commands.
74May those who fear you rejoice when
they see me, for I have put my hope in
your word.
75I know, O Lord , that your laws are
righteous, and in faithfulness you have
afflicted me.
76May your unfailing love be my comfort,
according to your promise to your
servant.
77Let your compassion come to me that I
may live, for your law is my delight.
78May the arrogant be put to shame for
wronging me without cause; but I will
meditate on your precepts.
79May those who fear you turn to me,
those who understand your statutes.
80May my heart be blameless toward
your decrees, that I may not be put to
shame.
81My soul faints with longing for your
salvation, but I have put my hope in your
word.
82My eyes fail, looking for your promise;
I say, "When will you comfort me?"
83Though I am like a wineskin in the
smoke, I do not forget your decrees.
84How long must your servant wait?
When will you punish my persecutors?
85The arrogant dig pitfalls for me,
contrary to your law.
86All your commands are trustworthy;
help me, for men persecute me without
cause.
87They almost wiped me from the earth,
but I have not forsaken your precepts.
88Preserve my life according to your love,
and I will obey the statutes of your
mouth.
89Your word, O Lord , is eternal; it
stands firm in the heavens.
90Your faithfulness continues through all
generations; you established the earth,
and it endures.
91Your laws endure to this day, for all
things serve you.
92If your law had not been my delight, I
would have perished in my affliction.
93I will never forget your precepts, for by
them you have preserved my life.
94Save me, for I am yours; I have sought
out your precepts.
95The wicked are waiting to destroy me,
but I will ponder your statutes.
96To all perfection I see a limit; but your
commands are boundless.
97Oh, how I love your law! I meditate on
it all day long.
98Your commands make me wiser than
my enemies, for they are ever with me.
99I have more insight than all my
teachers, for I meditate on your statutes.
100I have more understanding than the
elders, for I obey your precepts.
101I have kept my feet from every evil
path so that I might obey your word.
102I have not departed from your laws,
for you yourself have taught me.
103How sweet are your words to my
taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
104I gain understanding from your
precepts; therefore I hate every wrong
path.
105Your word is a lamp to my feet and a
light for my path.
106I have taken an oath and confirmed it,
that I will follow your righteous laws.
107I have suffered much; preserve my
life, O Lord , according to your word.
108Accept, O Lord , the willing praise of
my mouth, and teach me your laws.
109Though I constantly take my life in my
hands, I will not forget your law.
110The wicked have set a snare for me,
but I have not strayed from your
precepts.
111Your statutes are my heritage forever;
they are the joy of my heart.
112My heart is set on keeping your
decrees to the very end.
113I hate double-minded men, but I love
your law.
114You are my refuge and my shield; I
have put my hope in your word.
115Away from me, you evildoers, that I
may keep the commands of my God!
116Sustain me according to your promise,
and I will live; do not let my hopes be
dashed.
117Uphold me, and I will be delivered; I
will always have regard for your decrees.
118You reject all who stray from your
decrees, for their deceitfulness is in vain.
119All the wicked of the earth you discard
like dross; therefore I love your statutes.
120My flesh trembles in fear of you; I
stand in awe of your laws.
121I have done what is righteous and
just; do not leave me to my oppressors.
122Ensure your servant's well-being; let
not the arrogant oppress me.
123My eyes fail, looking for your salvation,
looking for your righteous promise.
124Deal with your servant according to
your love and teach me your decrees.
125I am your servant; give me
discernment that I may understand your
statutes.
126It is time for you to act, O Lord ; your
law is being broken.
127Because I love your commands more
than gold, more than pure gold,
128and because I consider all your
precepts right, I hate every wrong path.
129Your statutes are wonderful; therefore
I obey them.
130The unfolding of your words gives
light; it gives understanding to the
simple.
131I open my mouth and pant, longing for
your commands.
132Turn to me and have mercy on me, as
you always do to those who love your
name.
133Direct my footsteps according to your
word; let no sin rule over me.
134Redeem me from the oppression of
men, that I may obey your precepts.
135Make your face shine upon your
servant and teach me your decrees.
136Streams of tears flow from my eyes,
for your law is not obeyed.
137Righteous are you, O Lord , and your
laws are right.
138The statutes you have laid down are
righteous; they are fully trustworthy.
139My zeal wears me out, for my
enemies ignore your words.
140Your promises have been thoroughly
tested, and your servant loves them.
141Though I am lowly and despised, I do
not forget your precepts.
142Your righteousness is everlasting and
your law is true.
143Trouble and distress have come upon
me, but your commands are my delight.
144Your statutes are forever right; give
me understanding that I may live.
145I call with all my heart; answer me, O
Lord , and I will obey your decrees.
146I call out to you; save me and I will
keep your statutes.
147I rise before dawn and cry for help; I
have put my hope in your word.
148My eyes stay open through the
watches of the night, that I may meditate
on your promises.
149Hear my voice in accordance with
your love; preserve my life, O Lord ,
according to your laws.
150Those who devise wicked schemes
are near, but they are far from your law.
151Yet you are near, O Lord , and all
your commands are true.
152Long ago I learned from your statutes
that you established them to last forever.
153Look upon my suffering and deliver
me, for I have not forgotten your law.
154Defend my cause and redeem me;
preserve my life according to your
promise.
155Salvation is far from the wicked, for
they do not seek out your decrees.
156Your compassion is great, O Lord ;
preserve my life according to your laws.
157Many are the foes who persecute me,
but I have not turned from your statutes.
158I look on the faithless with loathing,
for they do not obey your word.
159See how I love your precepts;
preserve my life, O Lord , according to
your love.
160All your words are true; all your
righteous laws are eternal.
161Rulers persecute me without cause,
but my heart trembles at your word.
162I rejoice in your promise like one who
finds great spoil.
163I hate and abhor falsehood but I love
your law.
164Seven times a day I praise you for
your righteous laws.
165Great peace have they who love your
law, and nothing can make them
stumble.
166I wait for your salvation, O Lord , and I
follow your commands.
167I obey your statutes, for I love them
greatly.
168I obey your precepts and your
statutes, for all my ways are known to
you.
169May my cry come before you, O
Lord ; give me understanding according
to your word.
170May my supplication come before
you; deliver me according to your
promise.
171May my lips overflow with praise, for
you teach me your decrees.
172May my tongue sing of your word, for
all your commands are righteous.
173May your hand be ready to help me,
for I have chosen your precepts.
174I long for your salvation, O Lord , and
your law is my delight.
175Let me live that I may praise you, and
may your laws sustain me.
176I have strayed like a lost sheep. Seek
your servant, for I have not forgotten
your commands.
PSALM 120
1I call on the Lord in my distress, and he
answers me.
2Save me, O Lord , from lying lips and
from deceitful tongues.
3What will he do to you, and what more
besides, O deceitful tongue?
4He will punish you with a warrior's
sharp arrows, with burning coals of the
broom tree.
5Woe to me that I dwell in Meshech, that
I live among the tents of Kedar!
6Too long have I lived among those who
hate peace.
7I am a man of peace; but when I speak,
they are for war.
PSALM 121
1I lift up my eyes to the hills- where does
my help come from?
2My help comes from the Lord , the
Maker of heaven and earth.
3He will not let your foot slip- he who
watches over you will not slumber;
4indeed, he who watches over Israel will
neither slumber nor sleep.
5The Lord watches over you- the Lord is
your shade at your right hand;
6the sun will not harm you by day, nor
the moon by night.
7The Lord will keep you from all harmhe
will watch over your life;
8the Lord will watch over your coming
and going both now and forevermore.
PSALM 122
1I rejoiced with those who said to me,
"Let us go to the house of the Lord ."
2Our feet are standing in your gates, O
Jerusalem.
3Jerusalem is built like a city that is
closely compacted together.
4That is where the tribes go up, the
tribes of the Lord , to praise the name of
the Lord according to the statute given
to Israel.
5There the thrones for judgment stand,
the thrones of the house of David.
6Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: "May
those who love you be secure.
7May there be peace within your walls
and security within your citadels."
8For the sake of my brothers and friends,
I will say, "Peace be within you."
9For the sake of the house of the Lord
our God, I will seek your prosperity.
PSALM 123
1I lift up my eyes to you, to you whose
throne is in heaven.
2As the eyes of slaves look to the hand
of their master, as the eyes of a maid
look to the hand of her mistress, so our
eyes look to the Lord our God, till he
shows us his mercy.
3Have mercy on us, O Lord , have
mercy on us, for we have endured much
contempt.
4We have endured much ridicule from
the proud, much contempt from the
arrogant.
PSALM 124
1If the Lord had not been on our side- let
Israel say-
2if the Lord had not been on our side
when men attacked us,
3when their anger flared against us, they
would have swallowed us alive;
4the flood would have engulfed us, the
torrent would have swept over us,
5the raging waters would have swept us
away.
6Praise be to the Lord , who has not let
us be torn by their teeth.
7We have escaped like a bird out of the
fowler's snare; the snare has been
broken, and we have escaped.
8Our help is in the name of the Lord , the
Maker of heaven and earth.
PSALM 125
1Those who trust in the Lord are like
Mount Zion, which cannot be shaken but
endures forever.
2As the mountains surround Jerusalem,
so the Lord surrounds his people both
now and forevermore.
3The scepter of the wicked will not
remain over the land allotted to the
righteous, for then the righteous might
use their hands to do evil.
4Do good, O Lord , to those who are
good, to those who are upright in heart.
5But those who turn to crooked ways the
Lord will banish with the evildoers.
Peace be upon Israel.
PSALM 126
1When the Lord brought back the
captives to Zion, we were like men who
dreamed.
2Our mouths were filled with laughter,
our tongues with songs of joy. Then it
was said among the nations, "The Lord
has done great things for them."
3The Lord has done great things for us,
and we are filled with joy.
4Restore our fortunes, O Lord , like
streams in the Negev.
5Those who sow in tears will reap with
songs of joy.
6He who goes out weeping, carrying
seed to sow, will return with songs of joy,
carrying sheaves with him.
PSALM 127
1Unless the Lord builds the house, its
builders labor in vain. Unless the Lord
watches over the city, the watchmen
stand guard in vain.
2In vain you rise early and stay up late,
toiling for food to eat- for he grants sleep
to those he loves.
3Sons are a heritage from the Lord ,
children a reward from him.
4Like arrows in the hands of a warrior
are sons born in one's youth.
5Blessed is the man whose quiver is full
of them. They will not be put to shame
when they contend with their enemies in
the gate.
PSALM 128
1Blessed are all who fear the Lord , who
walk in his ways.
2You will eat the fruit of your labor;
blessings and prosperity will be yours.
3Your wife will be like a fruitful vine
within your house; your sons will be like
olive shoots around your table.
4Thus is the man blessed who fears the
Lord .
5May the Lord bless you from Zion all
the days of your life; may you see the
prosperity of Jerusalem,
6and may you live to see your children's
children. Peace be upon Israel.
PSALM 129
1They have greatly oppressed me from
my youth- let Israel say-
2they have greatly oppressed me from
my youth, but they have not gained the
victory over me.
3Plowmen have plowed my back and
made their furrows long.
4But the Lord is righteous; he has cut
me free from the cords of the wicked.
5May all who hate Zion be turned back
in shame.
6May they be like grass on the roof,
which withers before it can grow;
7with it the reaper cannot fill his hands,
nor the one who gathers fill his arms.
8May those who pass by not say, "The
blessing of the Lord be upon you; we
bless you in the name of the Lord ."
PSALM 130
1Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord ;
2O Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be
attentive to my cry for mercy.
3If you, O Lord , kept a record of sins, O
Lord, who could stand?
4But with you there is forgiveness;
therefore you are feared.
5I wait for the Lord , my soul waits, and
in his word I put my hope.
6My soul waits for the Lord more than
watchmen wait for the morning, more
than watchmen wait for the morning.
7O Israel, put your hope in the Lord , for
with the Lord is unfailing love and with
him is full redemption.
8He himself will redeem Israel from all
their sins.
PSALM 131
1My heart is not proud, O Lord , my eyes
are not haughty; I do not concern myself
with great matters or things too
wonderful for me.
2But I have stilled and quieted my soul;
like a weaned child with its mother, like
a weaned child is my soul within me.
3O Israel, put your hope in the Lord both
now and forevermore.
PSALM 132
1O Lord , remember David and all the
hardships he endured.
2He swore an oath to the Lord and made
a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob:
3"I will not enter my house or go to my
bed-
4I will allow no sleep to my eyes, no
slumber to my eyelids,
5till I find a place for the Lord , a dwelling
for the Mighty One of Jacob."
6We heard it in Ephrathah, we came
upon it in the fields of Jaar :
7"Let us go to his dwelling place; let us
worship at his footstool-
8arise, O Lord , and come to your resting
place, you and the ark of your might.
9May your priests be clothed with
righteousness; may your saints sing for
joy."
10For the sake of David your servant, do
not reject your anointed one.
11The Lord swore an oath to David, a
sure oath that he will not revoke: "One
of your own descendants I will place on
your throne-
12if your sons keep my covenant and the
statutes I teach them, then their sons
will sit on your throne for ever and ever."
13For the Lord has chosen Zion, he has
desired it for his dwelling:
14"This is my resting place for ever and
ever; here I will sit enthroned, for I have
desired it-
15I will bless her with abundant
provisions; her poor will I satisfy with
food.
16I will clothe her priests with salvation,
and her saints will ever sing for joy.
17"Here I will make a horn grow for
David and set up a lamp for my anointed
one.
18I will clothe his enemies with shame,
but the crown on his head will be
resplendent."
PSALM 133
1How good and pleasant it is when
brothers live together in unity!
2It is like precious oil poured on the head,
running down on the beard, running
down on Aaron's beard, down upon the
collar of his robes.
3It is as if the dew of Hermon were
falling on Mount Zion. For there the Lord
bestows his blessing, even life
forevermore.
PSALM 134
1Praise the Lord , all you servants of the
Lord who minister by night in the house
of the Lord .
2Lift up your hands in the sanctuary and
praise the Lord .
3May the Lord , the Maker of heaven
and earth, bless you from Zion.
PSALM 135
1Praise the Lord . Praise the name of
the Lord ; praise him, you servants of
the Lord ,
2you who minister in the house of the
Lord , in the courts of the house of our
God.
3Praise the Lord , for the Lord is good;
sing praise to his name, for that is
pleasant.
4For the Lord has chosen Jacob to be
his own, Israel to be his treasured
possession.
5I know that the Lord is great, that our
Lord is greater than all gods.
6The Lord does whatever pleases him,
in the heavens and on the earth, in the
seas and all their depths.
7He makes clouds rise from the ends of
the earth; he sends lightning with the
rain and brings out the wind from his
storehouses.
8He struck down the firstborn of Egypt,
the firstborn of men and animals.
9He sent his signs and wonders into
your midst, O Egypt, against Pharaoh
and all his servants.
10He struck down many nations and
killed mighty kings11Sihon
king of the Amorites, Og king of
Bashan and all the kings of Canaan-
12and he gave their land as an
inheritance, an inheritance to his people
Israel.
13Your name, O Lord , endures forever,
your renown, O Lord , through all
generations.
14For the Lord will vindicate his people
and have compassion on his servants.
15The idols of the nations are silver and
gold, made by the hands of men.
16They have mouths, but cannot speak,
eyes, but they cannot see;
17they have ears, but cannot hear, nor is
there breath in their mouths.
18Those who make them will be like
them, and so will all who trust in them.
19O house of Israel, praise the Lord ; O
house of Aaron, praise the Lord ;
20O house of Levi, praise the Lord ; you
who fear him, praise the Lord .
21Praise be to the Lord from Zion, to him
who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise the
Lord .
PSALM 136
1Give thanks to the Lord , for he is good.
His love endures forever.
2Give thanks to the God of gods. His
love endures forever.
3Give thanks to the Lord of lords: His
love endures forever.
4to him who alone does great wonders,
His love endures forever.
5who by his understanding made the
heavens, His love endures forever.
6who spread out the earth upon the
waters, His love endures forever.
7who made the great lights- His love
endures forever.
8the sun to govern the day, His love
endures forever.
9the moon and stars to govern the night;
His love endures forever.
10to him who struck down the firstborn of
Egypt His love endures forever.
11and brought Israel out from among
them His love endures forever.
12with a mighty hand and outstretched
arm; His love endures forever.
13to him who divided the Red Sea
asunder His love endures forever.
14and brought Israel through the midst of
it, His love endures forever.
15but swept Pharaoh and his army into
the Red Sea; His love endures forever.
16to him who led his people through the
desert, His love endures forever.
17who struck down great kings, His love
endures forever.
18and killed mighty kings- His love
endures forever.
19Sihon king of the Amorites His love
endures forever.
20and Og king of Bashan- His love
endures forever.
21and gave their land as an inheritance,
His love endures forever.
22an inheritance to his servant Israel; His
love endures forever.
23to the One who remembered us in our
low estate His love endures forever.
24and freed us from our enemies, His
love endures forever.
25and who gives food to every creature.
His love endures forever.
26Give thanks to the God of heaven. His
love endures forever.
PSALM 137
1By the rivers of Babylon we sat and
wept when we remembered Zion.
2There on the poplars we hung our
harps,
3for there our captors asked us for
songs, our tormentors demanded songs
of joy; they said, "Sing us one of the
songs of Zion!"
4How can we sing the songs of the Lord
while in a foreign land?
5If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my
right hand forget its skill .
6May my tongue cling to the roof of my
mouth if I do not remember you, if I do
not consider Jerusalem my highest joy.
7Remember, O Lord , what the Edomites
did on the day Jerusalem fell. "Tear it
down," they cried, "tear it down to its
foundations!"
8O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to
destruction, happy is he who repays you
for what you have done to us-
9he who seizes your infants and dashes
them against the rocks.
PSALM 138
1I will praise you, O Lord , with all my
heart; before the "gods" I will sing your
praise.
2I will bow down toward your holy temple
and will praise your name for your love
and your faithfulness, for you have
exalted above all things your name and
your word.
3When I called, you answered me; you
made me bold and stouthearted.
4May all the kings of the earth praise
you, O Lord , when they hear the words
of your mouth.
5May they sing of the ways of the Lord ,
for the glory of the Lord is great.
6Though the Lord is on high, he looks
upon the lowly, but the proud he knows
from afar.
7Though I walk in the midst of trouble,
you preserve my life; you stretch out
your hand against the anger of my foes,
with your right hand you save me.
8The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me;
your love, O Lord , endures forever- do
not abandon the works of your hands.
PSALM 139
1O Lord , you have searched me and
you know me.
2You know when I sit and when I rise;
you perceive my thoughts from afar.
3You discern my going out and my lying
down; you are familiar with all my ways.
4Before a word is on my tongue you
know it completely, O Lord .
5You hem me in-behind and before; you
have laid your hand upon me.
6Such knowledge is too wonderful for
me, too lofty for me to attain.
7Where can I go from your Spirit? Where
can I flee from your presence?
8If I go up to the heavens, you are there;
if I make my bed in the depths, you are
there.
9If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I
settle on the far side of the sea,
10even there your hand will guide me,
your right hand will hold me fast.
11If I say, "Surely the darkness will hide
me and the light become night around
me,"
12even the darkness will not be dark to
you; the night will shine like the day, for
darkness is as light to you.
13For you created my inmost being; you
knit me together in my mother's womb.
14I praise you because I am fearfully and
wonderfully made; your works are
wonderful, I know that full well.
15My frame was not hidden from you
when I was made in the secret place.
When I was woven together in the
depths of the earth,
16your eyes saw my unformed body. All
the days ordained for me were written in
your book before one of them came to
be.
17How precious to me are your thoughts,
O God! How vast is the sum of them!
18Were I to count them, they would
outnumber the grains of sand. When I
awake, I am still with you.
19If only you would slay the wicked, O
God! Away from me, you bloodthirsty
men!
20They speak of you with evil intent; your
adversaries misuse your name.
21Do I not hate those who hate you, O
Lord , and abhor those who rise up
against you?
22I have nothing but hatred for them; I
count them my enemies.
23Search me, O God, and know my
heart; test me and know my anxious
thoughts.
24See if there is any offensive way in me,
and lead me in the way everlasting.
PSALM 140
1Rescue me, O Lord , from evil men;
protect me from men of violence,
2who devise evil plans in their hearts
and stir up war every day.
3They make their tongues as sharp as a
serpent's; the poison of vipers is on their
lips. Selah
4Keep me, O Lord , from the hands of
the wicked; protect me from men of
violence who plan to trip my feet.
5Proud men have hidden a snare for me;
they have spread out the cords of their
net and have set traps for me along my
path. Selah
6O Lord , I say to you, "You are my
God." Hear, O Lord , my cry for mercy.
7O Sovereign Lord , my strong deliverer,
who shields my head in the day of
battle-
8do not grant the wicked their desires, O
Lord ; do not let their plans succeed, or
they will become proud. Selah
9Let the heads of those who surround
me be covered with the trouble their lips
have caused.
10Let burning coals fall upon them; may
they be thrown into the fire, into miry pits,
never to rise.
11Let slanderers not be established in
the land; may disaster hunt down men
of violence.
12I know that the Lord secures justice for
the poor and upholds the cause of the
needy.
13Surely the righteous will praise your
name and the upright will live before you.
PSALM 141
1O Lord , I call to you; come quickly to
me. Hear my voice when I call to you.
2May my prayer be set before you like
incense; may the lifting up of my hands
be like the evening sacrifice.
3Set a guard over my mouth, O Lord ;
keep watch over the door of my lips.
4Let not my heart be drawn to what is
evil, to take part in wicked deeds with
men who are evildoers; let me not eat of
their delicacies.
5Let a righteous man strike me-it is a
kindness; let him rebuke me-it is oil on
my head. My head will not refuse it. Yet
my prayer is ever against the deeds of
evildoers;
6their rulers will be thrown down from
the cliffs, and the wicked will learn that
my words were well spoken.
7They will say, "As one plows and
breaks up the earth, so our bones have
been scattered at the mouth of the
grave. "
8But my eyes are fixed on you, O
Sovereign Lord ; in you I take refuge-do
not give me over to death.
9Keep me from the snares they have
laid for me, from the traps set by
evildoers.
10Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
while I pass by in safety.
PSALM 142
1I cry aloud to the Lord ; I lift up my
voice to the Lord for mercy.
2I pour out my complaint before him;
before him I tell my trouble.
3When my spirit grows faint within me, it
is you who know my way. In the path
where I walk men have hidden a snare
for me.
4Look to my right and see; no one is
concerned for me. I have no refuge; no
one cares for my life.
5I cry to you, O Lord ; I say, "You are my
refuge, my portion in the land of the
living."
6Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate
need; rescue me from those who pursue
me, for they are too strong for me.
7Set me free from my prison, that I may
praise your name. Then the righteous
will gather about me because of your
goodness to me.
PSALM 143
1O Lord , hear my prayer, listen to my
cry for mercy; in your faithfulness and
righteousness come to my relief.
2Do not bring your servant into judgment,
for no one living is righteous before you.
3The enemy pursues me, he crushes me
to the ground; he makes me dwell in
darkness like those long dead.
4So my spirit grows faint within me; my
heart within me is dismayed.
5I remember the days of long ago; I
meditate on all your works and consider
what your hands have done.
6I spread out my hands to you; my soul
thirsts for you like a parched land. Selah
7Answer me quickly, O Lord ; my spirit
fails. Do not hide your face from me or I
will be like those who go down to the pit.
8Let the morning bring me word of your
unfailing love, for I have put my trust in
you. Show me the way I should go, for
to you I lift up my soul.
9Rescue me from my enemies, O Lord ,
for I hide myself in you.
10Teach me to do your will, for you are
my God; may your good Spirit lead me
on level ground.
11For your name's sake, O Lord ,
preserve my life; in your righteousness,
bring me out of trouble.
12In your unfailing love, silence my
enemies; destroy all my foes, for I am
your servant.
PSALM 144
1Praise be to the Lord my Rock, who
trains my hands for war, my fingers for
battle.
2He is my loving God and my fortress,
my stronghold and my deliverer, my
shield, in whom I take refuge, who
subdues peoples under me.
3O Lord , what is man that you care for
him, the son of man that you think of
him?
4Man is like a breath; his days are like a
fleeting shadow.
5Part your heavens, O Lord , and come
down; touch the mountains, so that they
smoke.
6Send forth lightning and scatter [the
enemies]; shoot your arrows and rout
them.
7Reach down your hand from on high;
deliver me and rescue me from the
mighty waters, from the hands of
foreigners
8whose mouths are full of lies, whose
right hands are deceitful.
9I will sing a new song to you, O God; on
the ten-stringed lyre I will make music to
you,
10to the One who gives victory to kings,
who delivers his servant David from the
deadly sword.
11Deliver me and rescue me from the
hands of foreigners whose mouths are
full of lies, whose right hands are
deceitful.
12Then our sons in their youth will be like
well-nurtured plants, and our daughters
will be like pillars carved to adorn a
palace.
13Our barns will be filled with every kind
of provision. Our sheep will increase by
thousands, by tens of thousands in our
fields;
14our oxen will draw heavy loads. There
will be no breaching of walls, no going
into captivity, no cry of distress in our
streets.
15Blessed are the people of whom this is
true; blessed are the people whose God
is the Lord .
PSALM 145
1I will exalt you, my God the King; I will
praise your name for ever and ever.
2Every day I will praise you and extol
your name for ever and ever.
3Great is the Lord and most worthy of
praise; his greatness no one can fathom.
4One generation will commend your
works to another; they will tell of your
mighty acts.
5They will speak of the glorious splendor
of your majesty, and I will meditate on
your wonderful works.
6They will tell of the power of your
awesome works, and I will proclaim your
great deeds.
7They will celebrate your abundant
goodness and joyfully sing of your
righteousness.
8The Lord is gracious and
compassionate, slow to anger and rich
in love.
9The Lord is good to all; he has
compassion on all he has made.
10All you have made will praise you, O
Lord ; your saints will extol you.
11They will tell of the glory of your
kingdom and speak of your might,
12so that all men may know of your
mighty acts and the glorious splendor of
your kingdom.
13Your kingdom is an everlasting
kingdom, and your dominion endures
through all generations. The Lord is
faithful to all his promises and loving
toward all he has made.
14The Lord upholds all those who fall
and lifts up all who are bowed down.
15The eyes of all look to you, and you
give them their food at the proper time.
16You open your hand and satisfy the
desires of every living thing.
17The Lord is righteous in all his ways
and loving toward all he has made.
18The Lord is near to all who call on him,
to all who call on him in truth.
19He fulfills the desires of those who fear
him; he hears their cry and saves them.
20The Lord watches over all who love
him, but all the wicked he will destroy.
21My mouth will speak in praise of the
Lord . Let every creature praise his holy
name for ever and ever.
PSALM 146
1Praise the Lord . Praise the Lord , O my
soul.
2I will praise the Lord all my life; I will
sing praise to my God as long as I live.
3Do not put your trust in princes, in
mortal men, who cannot save.
4When their spirit departs, they return to
the ground; on that very day their plans
come to nothing.
5Blessed is he whose help is the God of
Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his
God,
6the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea,
and everything in them- the Lord , who
remains faithful forever.
7He upholds the cause of the oppressed
and gives food to the hungry. The Lord
sets prisoners free,
8the Lord gives sight to the blind, the
Lord lifts up those who are bowed down,
the Lord loves the righteous.
9The Lord watches over the alien and
sustains the fatherless and the widow,
but he frustrates the ways of the wicked.
10The Lord reigns forever, your God, O
Zion, for all generations. Praise the
Lord .
PSALM 147
1Praise the Lord . How good it is to sing
praises to our God, how pleasant and
fitting to praise him!
2The Lord builds up Jerusalem; he
gathers the exiles of Israel.
3He heals the brokenhearted and binds
up their wounds.
4He determines the number of the stars
and calls them each by name.
5Great is our Lord and mighty in power;
his understanding has no limit.
6The Lord sustains the humble but casts
the wicked to the ground.
7Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving;
make music to our God on the harp.
8He covers the sky with clouds; he
supplies the earth with rain and makes
grass grow on the hills.
9He provides food for the cattle and for
the young ravens when they call.
10His pleasure is not in the strength of
the horse, nor his delight in the legs of a
man;
11the Lord delights in those who fear him,
who put their hope in his unfailing love.
12Extol the Lord , O Jerusalem; praise
your God, O Zion,
13for he strengthens the bars of your
gates and blesses your people within
you.
14He grants peace to your borders and
satisfies you with the finest of wheat.
15He sends his command to the earth;
his word runs swiftly.
16He spreads the snow like wool and
scatters the frost like ashes.
17He hurls down his hail like pebbles.
Who can withstand his icy blast?
18He sends his word and melts them; he
stirs up his breezes, and the waters flow.
19He has revealed his word to Jacob, his
laws and decrees to Israel.
20He has done this for no other nation;
they do not know his laws. Praise the
Lord .
PSALM 148
1Praise the Lord . Praise the Lord from
the heavens, praise him in the heights
above.
2Praise him, all his angels, praise him,
all his heavenly hosts.
3Praise him, sun and moon, praise him,
all you shining stars.
4Praise him, you highest heavens and
you waters above the skies.
5Let them praise the name of the Lord ,
for he commanded and they were
created.
6He set them in place for ever and ever;
he gave a decree that will never pass
away.
7Praise the Lord from the earth, you
great sea creatures and all ocean
depths,
8lightning and hail, snow and clouds,
stormy winds that do his bidding,
9you mountains and all hills, fruit trees
and all cedars,
10wild animals and all cattle, small
creatures and flying birds,
11kings of the earth and all nations, you
princes and all rulers on earth,
12young men and maidens, old men and
children.
13Let them praise the name of the Lord ,
for his name alone is exalted; his
splendor is above the earth and the
heavens.
14He has raised up for his people a horn,
the praise of all his saints, of Israel, the
people close to his heart. Praise the
Lord .
PSALM 149
1Praise the Lord . Sing to the Lord a new
song, his praise in the assembly of the
saints.
2Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the
people of Zion be glad in their King.
3Let them praise his name with dancing
and make music to him with tambourine
and harp.
4For the Lord takes delight in his people;
he crowns the humble with salvation.
5Let the saints rejoice in this honor and
sing for joy on their beds.
6May the praise of God be in their
mouths and a double-edged sword in
their hands,
7to inflict vengeance on the nations and
punishment on the peoples,
8to bind their kings with fetters, their
nobles with shackles of iron,
9to carry out the sentence written
against them. This is the glory of all his
saints. Praise the Lord .
PSALM 150
1Praise the Lord . Praise God in his
sanctuary; praise him in his mighty
heavens.
2Praise him for his acts of power; praise
him for his surpassing greatness.
3Praise him with the sounding of the
trumpet, praise him with the harp and
lyre,
4praise him with tambourine and
dancing, praise him with the strings and
flute,
5praise him with the clash of cymbals,
praise him with resounding cymbals.
6Let everything that has breath praise
the Lord . Praise the Lord .
Proverbs
1The proverbs of Solomon son of
David, king of Israel:
2for attaining wisdom and discipline; for
understanding words of insight;
3for acquiring a disciplined and prudent
life, doing what is right and just and fair;
4for giving prudence to the simple,
knowledge and discretion to the young-
5let the wise listen and add to their
learning, and let the discerning get
guidance-
6for understanding proverbs and
parables, the sayings and riddles of the
wise.
7The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
knowledge, but fools despise wisdom
and discipline. Exhortations to Embrace
Wisdom
8Listen, my son, to your father's
instruction and do not forsake your
mother's teaching.
9They will be a garland to grace your
head and a chain to adorn your neck.
10My son, if sinners entice you, do not
give in to them.
11If they say, "Come along with us; let's
lie in wait for someone's blood, let's
waylay some harmless soul;
12let's swallow them alive, like the grave,
and whole, like those who go down to
the pit;
13we will get all sorts of valuable things
and fill our houses with plunder;
14throw in your lot with us, and we will
share a common purse"-
15my son, do not go along with them, do
not set foot on their paths;
16for their feet rush into sin, they are
swift to shed blood.
17How useless to spread a net in full
view of all the birds!
18These men lie in wait for their own
blood; they waylay only themselves!
19Such is the end of all who go after illgotten
gain; it takes away the lives of
those who get it.
20Wisdom calls aloud in the street, she
raises her voice in the public squares;
21at the head of the noisy streets she
cries out, in the gateways of the city she
makes her speech:
22"How long will you simple ones love
your simple ways? How long will
mockers delight in mockery and fools
hate knowledge?
23If you had responded to my rebuke, I
would have poured out my heart to you
and made my thoughts known to you.
24But since you rejected me when I
called and no one gave heed when I
stretched out my hand,
25since you ignored all my advice and
would not accept my rebuke,
26I in turn will laugh at your disaster; I
will mock when calamity overtakes you-
27when calamity overtakes you like a
storm, when disaster sweeps over you
like a whirlwind, when distress and
trouble overwhelm you.
28"Then they will call to me but I will not
answer; they will look for me but will not
find me.
29Since they hated knowledge and did
not choose to fear the Lord ,
30since they would not accept my advice
and spurned my rebuke,
31they will eat the fruit of their ways and
be filled with the fruit of their schemes.
32For the waywardness of the simple will
kill them, and the complacency of fools
will destroy them;
33but whoever listens to me will live in
safety and be at ease, without fear of
harm."
2My son, if you accept my words and
store up my commands within you,
2turning your ear to wisdom and
applying your heart to understanding,
3and if you call out for insight and cry
aloud for understanding,
4and if you look for it as for silver and
search for it as for hidden treasure,
5then you will understand the fear of the
Lord and find the knowledge of God.
6For the Lord gives wisdom, and from
his mouth come knowledge and
understanding.
7He holds victory in store for the upright,
he is a shield to those whose walk is
blameless,
8for he guards the course of the just and
protects the way of his faithful ones.
9Then you will understand what is right
and just and fair-every good path.
10For wisdom will enter your heart, and
knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
11Discretion will protect you, and
understanding will guard you.
12Wisdom will save you from the ways of
wicked men, from men whose words are
perverse,
13who leave the straight paths to walk in
dark ways,
14who delight in doing wrong and rejoice
in the perverseness of evil,
15whose paths are crooked and who are
devious in their ways.
16It will save you also from the
adulteress, from the wayward wife with
her seductive words,
17who has left the partner of her youth
and ignored the covenant she made
before God.
18For her house leads down to death
and her paths to the spirits of the dead.
19None who go to her return or attain the
paths of life.
20Thus you will walk in the ways of good
men and keep to the paths of the
righteous.
21For the upright will live in the land, and
the blameless will remain in it;
22but the wicked will be cut off from the
land, and the unfaithful will be torn from
it.
3My son, do not forget my teaching,
but keep my commands in your heart,
2for they will prolong your life many
years and bring you prosperity.
3Let love and faithfulness never leave
you; bind them around your neck, write
them on the tablet of your heart.
4Then you will win favor and a good
name in the sight of God and man.
5Trust in the Lord with all your heart and
lean not on your own understanding;
6in all your ways acknowledge him, and
he will make your paths straight.
7Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear
the Lord and shun evil.
8This will bring health to your body and
nourishment to your bones.
9Honor the Lord with your wealth, with
the firstfruits of all your crops;
10then your barns will be filled to
overflowing, and your vats will brim over
with new wine.
11My son, do not despise the Lord 's
discipline and do not resent his rebuke,
12because the Lord disciplines those he
loves, as a father the son he delights in.
13Blessed is the man who finds wisdom,
the man who gains understanding,
14for she is more profitable than silver
and yields better returns than gold.
15She is more precious than rubies;
nothing you desire can compare with
her.
16Long life is in her right hand; in her left
hand are riches and honor.
17Her ways are pleasant ways, and all
her paths are peace.
18She is a tree of life to those who
embrace her; those who lay hold of her
will be blessed.
19By wisdom the Lord laid the earth's
foundations, by understanding he set
the heavens in place;
20by his knowledge the deeps were
divided, and the clouds let drop the dew.
21My son, preserve sound judgment and
discernment, do not let them out of your
sight;
22they will be life for you, an ornament to
grace your neck.
23Then you will go on your way in safety,
and your foot will not stumble;
24when you lie down, you will not be
afraid; when you lie down, your sleep
will be sweet.
25Have no fear of sudden disaster or of
the ruin that overtakes the wicked,
26for the Lord will be your confidence
and will keep your foot from being
snared.
27Do not withhold good from those who
deserve it, when it is in your power to
act.
28Do not say to your neighbor, "Come
back later; I'll give it tomorrow"- when
you now have it with you.
29Do not plot harm against your
neighbor, who lives trustfully near you.
30Do not accuse a man for no reasonwhen
he has done you no harm.
31Do not envy a violent man or choose
any of his ways,
32for the Lord detests a perverse man
but takes the upright into his confidence.
33The Lord 's curse is on the house of
the wicked, but he blesses the home of
the righteous.
34He mocks proud mockers but gives
grace to the humble.
35The wise inherit honor, but fools he
holds up to shame.
4Listen, my sons, to a father's
instruction; pay attention and gain
understanding.
2I give you sound learning, so do not
forsake my teaching.
3When I was a boy in my father's house,
still tender, and an only child of my
mother,
4he taught me and said, "Lay hold of my
words with all your heart; keep my
commands and you will live.
5Get wisdom, get understanding; do not
forget my words or swerve from them.
6Do not forsake wisdom, and she will
protect you; love her, and she will watch
over you.
7Wisdom is supreme; therefore get
wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get
understanding.
8Esteem her, and she will exalt you;
embrace her, and she will honor you.
9She will set a garland of grace on your
head and present you with a crown of
splendor."
10Listen, my son, accept what I say, and
the years of your life will be many.
11I guide you in the way of wisdom and
lead you along straight paths.
12When you walk, your steps will not be
hampered; when you run, you will not
stumble.
13Hold on to instruction, do not let it go;
guard it well, for it is your life.
14Do not set foot on the path of the
wicked or walk in the way of evil men.
15Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn from it
and go on your way.
16For they cannot sleep till they do evil;
they are robbed of slumber till they
make someone fall.
17They eat the bread of wickedness and
drink the wine of violence.
18The path of the righteous is like the
first gleam of dawn, shining ever
brighter till the full light of day.
19But the way of the wicked is like deep
darkness; they do not know what makes
them stumble.
20My son, pay attention to what I say;
listen closely to my words.
21Do not let them out of your sight, keep
them within your heart;
22for they are life to those who find them
and health to a man's whole body.
23Above all else, guard your heart, for it
is the wellspring of life.
24Put away perversity from your mouth;
keep corrupt talk far from your lips.
25Let your eyes look straight ahead, fix
your gaze directly before you.
26Make level paths for your feet and take
only ways that are firm.
27Do not swerve to the right or the left;
keep your foot from evil.
5My son, pay attention to my wisdom,
listen well to my words of insight,
2that you may maintain discretion and
your lips may preserve knowledge.
3For the lips of an adulteress drip honey,
and her speech is smoother than oil;
4but in the end she is bitter as gall,
sharp as a double-edged sword.
5Her feet go down to death; her steps
lead straight to the grave.
6She gives no thought to the way of life;
her paths are crooked, but she knows it
not.
7Now then, my sons, listen to me; do not
turn aside from what I say.
8Keep to a path far from her, do not go
near the door of her house,
9lest you give your best strength to
others and your years to one who is
cruel,
10lest strangers feast on your wealth and
your toil enrich another man's house.
11At the end of your life you will groan,
when your flesh and body are spent.
12You will say, "How I hated discipline!
How my heart spurned correction!
13I would not obey my teachers or listen
to my instructors.
14I have come to the brink of utter ruin in
the midst of the whole assembly."
15Drink water from your own cistern,
running water from your own well.
16Should your springs overflow in the
streets, your streams of water in the
public squares?
17Let them be yours alone, never to be
shared with strangers.
18May your fountain be blessed, and
may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.
19A loving doe, a graceful deer- may her
breasts satisfy you always, may you
ever be captivated by her love.
20Why be captivated, my son, by an
adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of
another man's wife?
21For a man's ways are in full view of the
Lord , and he examines all his paths.
22The evil deeds of a wicked man
ensnare him; the cords of his sin hold
him fast.
23He will die for lack of discipline, led
astray by his own great folly.
6My son, if you have put up security
for your neighbor, if you have struck
hands in pledge for another,
2if you have been trapped by what you
said, ensnared by the words of your
mouth,
3then do this, my son, to free yourself,
since you have fallen into your
neighbor's hands: Go and humble
yourself; press your plea with your
neighbor!
4Allow no sleep to your eyes, no
slumber to your eyelids.
5Free yourself, like a gazelle from the
hand of the hunter, like a bird from the
snare of the fowler.
6Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider
its ways and be wise!
7It has no commander, no overseer or
ruler,
8yet it stores its provisions in summer
and gathers its food at harvest.
9How long will you lie there, you
sluggard? When will you get up from
your sleep?
10A little sleep, a little slumber, a little
folding of the hands to rest-
11and poverty will come on you like a
bandit and scarcity like an armed man.
12A scoundrel and villain, who goes
about with a corrupt mouth,
13who winks with his eye, signals with
his feet and motions with his fingers,
14who plots evil with deceit in his hearthe
always stirs up dissension.
15Therefore disaster will overtake him in
an instant; he will suddenly be
destroyed-without remedy.
16There are six things the Lord hates,
seven that are detestable to him:
17haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands
that shed innocent blood,
18a heart that devises wicked schemes,
feet that are quick to rush into evil,
19a false witness who pours out lies and
a man who stirs up dissension among
brothers.
20My son, keep your father's commands
and do not forsake your mother's
teaching.
21Bind them upon your heart forever;
fasten them around your neck.
22When you walk, they will guide you;
when you sleep, they will watch over
you; when you awake, they will speak to
you.
23For these commands are a lamp, this
teaching is a light, and the corrections of
discipline are the way to life,
24keeping you from the immoral woman,
from the smooth tongue of the wayward
wife.
25Do not lust in your heart after her
beauty or let her captivate you with her
eyes,
26for the prostitute reduces you to a loaf
of bread, and the adulteress preys upon
your very life.
27Can a man scoop fire into his lap
without his clothes being burned?
28Can a man walk on hot coals without
his feet being scorched?
29So is he who sleeps with another
man's wife; no one who touches her will
go unpunished.
30Men do not despise a thief if he steals
to satisfy his hunger when he is starving.
31Yet if he is caught, he must pay
sevenfold, though it costs him all the
wealth of his house.
32But a man who commits adultery lacks
judgment; whoever does so destroys
himself.
33Blows and disgrace are his lot, and his
shame will never be wiped away;
34for jealousy arouses a husband's fury,
and he will show no mercy when he
takes revenge.
35He will not accept any compensation;
he will refuse the bribe, however great it
is.
7My son, keep my words and store up
my commands within you.
2Keep my commands and you will live;
guard my teachings as the apple of your
eye.
3Bind them on your fingers; write them
on the tablet of your heart.
4Say to wisdom, "You are my sister,"
and call understanding your kinsman;
5they will keep you from the adulteress,
from the wayward wife with her
seductive words.
6At the window of my house I looked out
through the lattice.
7I saw among the simple, I noticed
among the young men, a youth who
lacked judgment.
8He was going down the street near her
corner, walking along in the direction of
her house
9at twilight, as the day was fading, as
the dark of night set in.
10Then out came a woman to meet him,
dressed like a prostitute and with crafty
intent.
11(She is loud and defiant, her feet never
stay at home;
12now in the street, now in the squares,
at every corner she lurks.)
13She took hold of him and kissed him
and with a brazen face she said:
14"I have fellowship offerings at home;
today I fulfilled my vows.
15So I came out to meet you; I looked for
you and have found you!
16I have covered my bed with colored
linens from Egypt.
17I have perfumed my bed with myrrh,
aloes and cinnamon.
18Come, let's drink deep of love till
morning; let's enjoy ourselves with love!
19My husband is not at home; he has
gone on a long journey.
20He took his purse filled with money
and will not be home till full moon."
21With persuasive words she led him
astray; she seduced him with her
smooth talk.
22All at once he followed her like an ox
going to the slaughter, like a deer
stepping into a noose
23till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird
darting into a snare, little knowing it will
cost him his life.
24Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay
attention to what I say.
25Do not let your heart turn to her ways
or stray into her paths.
26Many are the victims she has brought
down; her slain are a mighty throng.
27Her house is a highway to the grave,
leading down to the chambers of death.
8Does not wisdom call out? Does not
understanding raise her voice?
2On the heights along the way, where
the paths meet, she takes her stand;
3beside the gates leading into the city, at
the entrances, she cries aloud:
4"To you, O men, I call out; I raise my
voice to all mankind.
5You who are simple, gain prudence;
you who are foolish, gain understanding.
6Listen, for I have worthy things to say; I
open my lips to speak what is right.
7My mouth speaks what is true, for my
lips detest wickedness.
8All the words of my mouth are just;
none of them is crooked or perverse.
9To the discerning all of them are right;
they are faultless to those who have
knowledge.
10Choose my instruction instead of silver,
knowledge rather than choice gold,
11for wisdom is more precious than
rubies, and nothing you desire can
compare with her.
12"I, wisdom, dwell together with
prudence; I possess knowledge and
discretion.
13To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate
pride and arrogance, evil behavior and
perverse speech.
14Counsel and sound judgment are
mine; I have understanding and power.
15By me kings reign and rulers make
laws that are just;
16by me princes govern, and all nobles
who rule on earth.
17I love those who love me, and those
who seek me find me.
18With me are riches and honor,
enduring wealth and prosperity.
19My fruit is better than fine gold; what I
yield surpasses choice silver.
20I walk in the way of righteousness,
along the paths of justice,
21bestowing wealth on those who love
me and making their treasuries full.
22"The Lord brought me forth as the first
of his works, , before his deeds of old;
23I was appointed from eternity, from the
beginning, before the world began.
24When there were no oceans, I was
given birth, when there were no springs
abounding with water;
25before the mountains were settled in
place, before the hills, I was given birth,
26before he made the earth or its fields
or any of the dust of the world.
27I was there when he set the heavens
in place, when he marked out the
horizon on the face of the deep,
28when he established the clouds above
and fixed securely the fountains of the
deep,
29when he gave the sea its boundary so
the waters would not overstep his
command, and when he marked out the
foundations of the earth.
30Then I was the craftsman at his side. I
was filled with delight day after day,
rejoicing always in his presence,
31rejoicing in his whole world and
delighting in mankind.
32"Now then, my sons, listen to me;
blessed are those who keep my ways.
33Listen to my instruction and be wise;
do not ignore it.
34Blessed is the man who listens to me,
watching daily at my doors, waiting at
my doorway.
35For whoever finds me finds life and
receives favor from the Lord .
36But whoever fails to find me harms
himself; all who hate me love death."
9Wisdom has built her house; she has
hewn out its seven pillars.
2She has prepared her meat and mixed
her wine; she has also set her table.
3She has sent out her maids, and she
calls from the highest point of the city.
4"Let all who are simple come in here!"
she says to those who lack judgment.
5"Come, eat my food and drink the wine
I have mixed.
6Leave your simple ways and you will
live; walk in the way of understanding.
7"Whoever corrects a mocker invites
insult; whoever rebukes a wicked man
incurs abuse.
8Do not rebuke a mocker or he will hate
you; rebuke a wise man and he will love
you.
9Instruct a wise man and he will be wiser
still; teach a righteous man and he will
add to his learning.
10"The fear of the Lord is the beginning
of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy
One is understanding.
11For through me your days will be many,
and years will be added to your life.
12If you are wise, your wisdom will
reward you; if you are a mocker, you
alone will suffer."
13The woman Folly is loud; she is
undisciplined and without knowledge.
14She sits at the door of her house, on a
seat at the highest point of the city,
15calling out to those who pass by, who
go straight on their way.
16"Let all who are simple come in here!"
she says to those who lack judgment.
17"Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in
secret is delicious!"
18But little do they know that the dead
are there, that her guests are in the
depths of the grave.
10The proverbs of Solomon: A wise
son brings joy to his father, but a foolish
son grief to his mother.
2Ill-gotten treasures are of no value, but
righteousness delivers from death.
3The Lord does not let the righteous go
hungry but he thwarts the craving of the
wicked.
4Lazy hands make a man poor, but
diligent hands bring wealth.
5He who gathers crops in summer is a
wise son, but he who sleeps during
harvest is a disgraceful son.
6Blessings crown the head of the
righteous, but violence overwhelms the
mouth of the wicked.
7The memory of the righteous will be a
blessing, but the name of the wicked will
rot.
8The wise in heart accept commands,
but a chattering fool comes to ruin.
9The man of integrity walks securely, but
he who takes crooked paths will be
found out.
10He who winks maliciously causes grief,
and a chattering fool comes to ruin.
11The mouth of the righteous is a
fountain of life, but violence overwhelms
the mouth of the wicked.
12Hatred stirs up dissension, but love
covers over all wrongs.
13Wisdom is found on the lips of the
discerning, but a rod is for the back of
him who lacks judgment.
14Wise men store up knowledge, but the
mouth of a fool invites ruin.
15The wealth of the rich is their fortified
city, but poverty is the ruin of the poor.
16The wages of the righteous bring them
life, but the income of the wicked brings
them punishment.
17He who heeds discipline shows the
way to life, but whoever ignores
correction leads others astray.
18He who conceals his hatred has lying
lips, and whoever spreads slander is a
fool.
19When words are many, sin is not
absent, but he who holds his tongue is
wise.
20The tongue of the righteous is choice
silver, but the heart of the wicked is of
little value.
21The lips of the righteous nourish many,
but fools die for lack of judgment.
22The blessing of the Lord brings wealth,
and he adds no trouble to it.
23A fool finds pleasure in evil conduct,
but a man of understanding delights in
wisdom.
24What the wicked dreads will overtake
him; what the righteous desire will be
granted.
25When the storm has swept by, the
wicked are gone, but the righteous
stand firm forever.
26As vinegar to the teeth and smoke to
the eyes, so is a sluggard to those who
send him.
27The fear of the Lord adds length to life,
but the years of the wicked are cut short.
28The prospect of the righteous is joy,
but the hopes of the wicked come to
nothing.
29The way of the Lord is a refuge for the
righteous, but it is the ruin of those who
do evil.
30The righteous will never be uprooted,
but the wicked will not remain in the land.
31The mouth of the righteous brings forth
wisdom, but a perverse tongue will be
cut out.
32The lips of the righteous know what is
fitting, but the mouth of the wicked only
what is perverse.
11The Lord abhors dishonest scales,
but accurate weights are his delight.
2When pride comes, then comes
disgrace, but with humility comes
wisdom.
3The integrity of the upright guides them,
but the unfaithful are destroyed by their
duplicity.
4Wealth is worthless in the day of wrath,
but righteousness delivers from death.
5The righteousness of the blameless
makes a straight way for them, but the
wicked are brought down by their own
wickedness.
6The righteousness of the upright
delivers them, but the unfaithful are
trapped by evil desires.
7When a wicked man dies, his hope
perishes; all he expected from his power
comes to nothing.
8The righteous man is rescued from
trouble, and it comes on the wicked
instead.
9With his mouth the godless destroys his
neighbor, but through knowledge the
righteous escape.
10When the righteous prosper, the city
rejoices; when the wicked perish, there
are shouts of joy.
11Through the blessing of the upright a
city is exalted, but by the mouth of the
wicked it is destroyed.
12A man who lacks judgment derides his
neighbor, but a man of understanding
holds his tongue.
13A gossip betrays a confidence, but a
trustworthy man keeps a secret.
14For lack of guidance a nation falls, but
many advisers make victory sure.
15He who puts up security for another
will surely suffer, but whoever refuses to
strike hands in pledge is safe.
16A kindhearted woman gains respect,
but ruthless men gain only wealth.
17A kind man benefits himself, but a
cruel man brings trouble on himself.
18The wicked man earns deceptive
wages, but he who sows righteousness
reaps a sure reward.
19The truly righteous man attains life, but
he who pursues evil goes to his death.
20The Lord detests men of perverse
heart but he delights in those whose
ways are blameless.
21Be sure of this: The wicked will not go
unpunished, but those who are
righteous will go free.
22Like a gold ring in a pig's snout is a
beautiful woman who shows no
discretion.
23The desire of the righteous ends only
in good, but the hope of the wicked only
in wrath.
24One man gives freely, yet gains even
more; another withholds unduly, but
comes to poverty.
25A generous man will prosper; he who
refreshes others will himself be
refreshed.
26People curse the man who hoards
grain, but blessing crowns him who is
willing to sell.
27He who seeks good finds goodwill, but
evil comes to him who searches for it.
28Whoever trusts in his riches will fall,
but the righteous will thrive like a green
leaf.
29He who brings trouble on his family will
inherit only wind, and the fool will be
servant to the wise.
30The fruit of the righteous is a tree of
life, and he who wins souls is wise.
31If the righteous receive their due on
earth, how much more the ungodly and
the sinner!
12Whoever loves discipline loves
knowledge, but he who hates correction
is stupid.
2A good man obtains favor from the
Lord , but the Lord condemns a crafty
man.

wickedness, but the righteous cannot be
uprooted.

husband's crown, but a disgraceful wife
is like decay in his bones.

the advice of the wicked is deceitful.

blood, but the speech of the upright
rescues them.
7Wicked men are overthrown and are no
more, but the house of the righteous
stands firm.
8A man is praised according to his
wisdom, but men with warped minds are
despised.
9Better to be a nobody and yet have a
servant than pretend to be somebody
and have no food.
10A righteous man cares for the needs of
his animal, but the kindest acts of the
wicked are cruel.
11He who works his land will have
abundant food, but he who chases
fantasies lacks judgment.
12The wicked desire the plunder of evil
men, but the root of the righteous
flourishes.
13An evil man is trapped by his sinful talk,
but a righteous man escapes trouble.
14From the fruit of his lips a man is filled
with good things as surely as the work
of his hands rewards him.
15The way of a fool seems right to him,
but a wise man listens to advice.
16A fool shows his annoyance at once,
but a prudent man overlooks an insult.
17A truthful witness gives honest
testimony, but a false witness tells lies.
18Reckless words pierce like a sword,
but the tongue of the wise brings healing.
19Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying
tongue lasts only a moment.
20There is deceit in the hearts of those
who plot evil, but joy for those who
promote peace.
21No harm befalls the righteous, but the
wicked have their fill of trouble.
22The Lord detests lying lips, but he
delights in men who are truthful.
23A prudent man keeps his knowledge to
himself, but the heart of fools blurts out
folly.
24Diligent hands will rule, but laziness
ends in slave labor.
25An anxious heart weighs a man down,
but a kind word cheers him up.
26A righteous man is cautious in
friendship, but the way of the wicked
leads them astray.
27The lazy man does not roast his game,
but the diligent man prizes his
possessions.
28In the way of righteousness there is
life; along that path is immortality.
13A wise son heeds his father's
instruction, but a mocker does not listen
to rebuke.
2From the fruit of his lips a man enjoys
good things, but the unfaithful have a
craving for violence.
3He who guards his lips guards his life,
but he who speaks rashly will come to
ruin.
4The sluggard craves and gets nothing,
but the desires of the diligent are fully
satisfied.
5The righteous hate what is false, but
the wicked bring shame and disgrace.
6Righteousness guards the man of
integrity, but wickedness overthrows the
sinner.

nothing; another pretends to be poor,
yet has great wealth.
8A man's riches may ransom his life, but
a poor man hears no threat.
9The light of the righteous shines
brightly, but the lamp of the wicked is
snuffed out.
10Pride only breeds quarrels, but
wisdom is found in those who take
advice.

he who gathers money little by little
makes it grow.
12Hope deferred makes the heart sick,
but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life.
13He who scorns instruction will pay for it,
but he who respects a command is
rewarded.
14The teaching of the wise is a fountain
of life, turning a man from the snares of
death.
15Good understanding wins favor, but
the way of the unfaithful is hard.
16Every prudent man acts out of
knowledge, but a fool exposes his folly.
17A wicked messenger falls into trouble,
but a trustworthy envoy brings healing.
18He who ignores discipline comes to
poverty and shame, but whoever heeds
correction is honored.

but fools detest turning from evil.

wise, but a companion of fools suffers
harm.
21Misfortune pursues the sinner, but
prosperity is the reward of the righteous.

his children's children, but a sinner's
wealth is stored up for the righteous.

abundant food, but injustice sweeps it
away.
24He who spares the rod hates his son,
but he who loves him is careful to
discipline him.
25The righteous eat to their hearts'
content, but the stomach of the wicked
goes hungry.
14The wise woman builds her house,
but with her own hands the foolish one
tears hers down.
2He whose walk is upright fears the
Lord , but he whose ways are devious
despises him.
3A fool's talk brings a rod to his back,
but the lips of the wise protect them.
4Where there are no oxen, the manger
is empty, but from the strength of an ox
comes an abundant harvest.
5A truthful witness does not deceive, but
a false witness pours out lies.
6The mocker seeks wisdom and finds
none, but knowledge comes easily to
the discerning.
7Stay away from a foolish man, for you
will not find knowledge on his lips.
8The wisdom of the prudent is to give
thought to their ways, but the folly of
fools is deception.
9Fools mock at making amends for sin,
but goodwill is found among the upright.
10Each heart knows its own bitterness,
and no one else can share its joy.
11The house of the wicked will be
destroyed, but the tent of the upright will
flourish.
12There is a way that seems right to a
man, but in the end it leads to death.
13Even in laughter the heart may ache,
and joy may end in grief.
14The faithless will be fully repaid for
their ways, and the good man rewarded
for his.
15A simple man believes anything, but a
prudent man gives thought to his steps.
16A wise man fears the Lord and shuns
evil, but a fool is hotheaded and
reckless.
17A quick-tempered man does foolish
things, and a crafty man is hated.
18The simple inherit folly, but the prudent
are crowned with knowledge.
19Evil men will bow down in the
presence of the good, and the wicked at
the gates of the righteous.
20The poor are shunned even by their
neighbors, but the rich have many
friends.
21He who despises his neighbor sins,
but blessed is he who is kind to the
needy.
22Do not those who plot evil go astray?
But those who plan what is good find
love and faithfulness.

talk leads only to poverty.

but the folly of fools yields folly.
25A truthful witness saves lives, but a
false witness is deceitful.

fortress, and for his children it will be a
refuge.

turning a man from the snares of death.
28A large population is a king's glory, but
without subjects a prince is ruined.
29A patient man has great understanding,
but a quick-tempered man displays folly.
30A heart at peace gives life to the body,
but envy rots the bones.
31He who oppresses the poor shows
contempt for their Maker, but whoever is
kind to the needy honors God.
32When calamity comes, the wicked are
brought down, but even in death the
righteous have a refuge.
33Wisdom reposes in the heart of the
discerning and even among fools she
lets herself be known.
34Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin
is a disgrace to any people.
35A king delights in a wise servant, but a
shameful servant incurs his wrath.
15A gentle answer turns away wrath,
but a harsh word stirs up anger.
2The tongue of the wise commends
knowledge, but the mouth of the fool
gushes folly.
3The eyes of the Lord are everywhere,
keeping watch on the wicked and the
good.
4The tongue that brings healing is a tree
of life, but a deceitful tongue crushes the
spirit.
5A fool spurns his father's discipline, but
whoever heeds correction shows
prudence.
6The house of the righteous contains
great treasure, but the income of the
wicked brings them trouble.
7The lips of the wise spread knowledge;
not so the hearts of fools.
8The Lord detests the sacrifice of the
wicked, but the prayer of the upright
pleases him.
9The Lord detests the way of the wicked
but he loves those who pursue
righteousness.
10Stern discipline awaits him who leaves
the path; he who hates correction will
die.
11Death and Destruction lie open before
the Lord - how much more the hearts of
men!
12A mocker resents correction; he will
not consult the wise.
13A happy heart makes the face cheerful,
but heartache crushes the spirit.
14The discerning heart seeks knowledge,
but the mouth of a fool feeds on folly.
15All the days of the oppressed are
wretched, but the cheerful heart has a
continual feast.
16Better a little with the fear of the Lord
than great wealth with turmoil.
17Better a meal of vegetables where
there is love than a fattened calf with
hatred.
18A hot-tempered man stirs up
dissension, but a patient man calms a
quarrel.
19The way of the sluggard is blocked
with thorns, but the path of the upright is
a highway.
20A wise son brings joy to his father, but
a foolish man despises his mother.
21Folly delights a man who lacks
judgment, but a man of understanding
keeps a straight course.
22Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with
many advisers they succeed.
23A man finds joy in giving an apt replyand
how good is a timely word!
24The path of life leads upward for the
wise to keep him from going down to the
grave.
25The Lord tears down the proud man's
house but he keeps the widow's
boundaries intact.

wicked, but those of the pure are
pleasing to him.

family, but he who hates bribes will live.

answers, but the mouth of the wicked
gushes evil.

hears the prayer of the righteous.
30A cheerful look brings joy to the heart,
and good news gives health to the
bones.
31He who listens to a life-giving rebuke
will be at home among the wise.
32He who ignores discipline despises
himself, but whoever heeds correction
gains understanding.
33The fear of the Lord teaches a man
wisdom, and humility comes before
honor.
16To man belong the plans of the
heart, but from the Lord comes the reply
of the tongue.
2All a man's ways seem innocent to him,
but motives are weighed by the Lord .
3Commit to the Lord whatever you do,
and your plans will succeed.
4The Lord works out everything for his
own ends- even the wicked for a day of
disaster.
5The Lord detests all the proud of heart.
Be sure of this: They will not go
unpunished.
6Through love and faithfulness sin is
atoned for; through the fear of the Lord
a man avoids evil.
7When a man's ways are pleasing to the
Lord , he makes even his enemies live
at peace with him.
8Better a little with righteousness than
much gain with injustice.
9In his heart a man plans his course, but
the Lord determines his steps.
10The lips of a king speak as an oracle,
and his mouth should not betray justice.
11Honest scales and balances are from
the Lord ; all the weights in the bag are
of his making.
12Kings detest wrongdoing, for a throne
is established through righteousness.
13Kings take pleasure in honest lips;
they value a man who speaks the truth.
14A king's wrath is a messenger of death,
but a wise man will appease it.
15When a king's face brightens, it means
life; his favor is like a rain cloud in spring.
16How much better to get wisdom than
gold, to choose understanding rather
than silver!
17The highway of the upright avoids evil;
he who guards his way guards his life.
18Pride goes before destruction, a
haughty spirit before a fall.
19Better to be lowly in spirit and among
the oppressed than to share plunder
with the proud.
20Whoever gives heed to instruction
prospers, and blessed is he who trusts
in the Lord .
21The wise in heart are called discerning,
and pleasant words promote instruction.
22Understanding is a fountain of life to
those who have it, but folly brings
punishment to fools.
23A wise man's heart guides his mouth,
and his lips promote instruction.
24Pleasant words are a honeycomb,
sweet to the soul and healing to the
bones.
25There is a way that seems right to a
man, but in the end it leads to death.
26The laborer's appetite works for him;
his hunger drives him on.
27A scoundrel plots evil, and his speech
is like a scorching fire.
28A perverse man stirs up dissension,
and a gossip separates close friends.
29A violent man entices his neighbor and
leads him down a path that is not good.
30He who winks with his eye is plotting
perversity; he who purses his lips is bent
on evil.
31Gray hair is a crown of splendor; it is
attained by a righteous life.
32Better a patient man than a warrior, a
man who controls his temper than one
who takes a city.
33The lot is cast into the lap, but its
every decision is from the Lord .
17Better a dry crust with peace and
quiet than a house full of feasting, with
strife.
2A wise servant will rule over a
disgraceful son, and will share the
inheritance as one of the brothers.
3The crucible for silver and the furnace
for gold, but the Lord tests the heart.
4A wicked man listens to evil lips; a liar
pays attention to a malicious tongue.
5He who mocks the poor shows
contempt for their Maker; whoever
gloats over disaster will not go
unpunished.
6Children's children are a crown to the
aged, and parents are the pride of their
children.
7Arrogant lips are unsuited to a foolhow
much worse lying lips to a ruler!
8A bribe is a charm to the one who gives
it; wherever he turns, he succeeds.
9He who covers over an offense
promotes love, but whoever repeats the
matter separates close friends.
10A rebuke impresses a man of
discernment more than a hundred
lashes a fool.
11An evil man is bent only on rebellion; a
merciless official will be sent against him.
12Better to meet a bear robbed of her
cubs than a fool in his folly.
13If a man pays back evil for good, evil
will never leave his house.
14Starting a quarrel is like breaching a
dam; so drop the matter before a
dispute breaks out.
15Acquitting the guilty and condemning
the innocent- the Lord detests them both.
16Of what use is money in the hand of a
fool, since he has no desire to get
wisdom?
17A friend loves at all times, and a
brother is born for adversity.
18A man lacking in judgment strikes
hands in pledge and puts up security for
his neighbor.
19He who loves a quarrel loves sin; he
who builds a high gate invites
destruction.
20A man of perverse heart does not
prosper; he whose tongue is deceitful
falls into trouble.
21To have a fool for a son brings grief;
there is no joy for the father of a fool.
22A cheerful heart is good medicine, but
a crushed spirit dries up the bones.
23A wicked man accepts a bribe in
secret to pervert the course of justice.
24A discerning man keeps wisdom in
view, but a fool's eyes wander to the
ends of the earth.
25A foolish son brings grief to his father
and bitterness to the one who bore him.
26It is not good to punish an innocent
man, or to flog officials for their integrity.
27A man of knowledge uses words with
restraint, and a man of understanding is
even-tempered.
28Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps
silent, and discerning if he holds his
tongue.
18An unfriendly man pursues selfish
ends; he defies all sound judgment.
2A fool finds no pleasure in
understanding but delights in airing his
own opinions.
3When wickedness comes, so does
contempt, and with shame comes
disgrace.
4The words of a man's mouth are deep
waters, but the fountain of wisdom is a
bubbling brook.
5It is not good to be partial to the wicked
or to deprive the innocent of justice.
6A fool's lips bring him strife, and his
mouth invites a beating.
7A fool's mouth is his undoing, and his
lips are a snare to his soul.
8The words of a gossip are like choice
morsels; they go down to a man's
inmost parts.
9One who is slack in his work is brother
to one who destroys.
10The name of the Lord is a strong
tower; the righteous run to it and are
safe.
11The wealth of the rich is their fortified
city; they imagine it an unscalable wall.
12Before his downfall a man's heart is
proud, but humility comes before honor.
13He who answers before listening- that
is his folly and his shame.
14A man's spirit sustains him in sickness,
but a crushed spirit who can bear?
15The heart of the discerning acquires
knowledge; the ears of the wise seek it
out.
16A gift opens the way for the giver and
ushers him into the presence of the
great.
17The first to present his case seems
right, till another comes forward and
questions him.
18Casting the lot settles disputes and
keeps strong opponents apart.
19An offended brother is more unyielding
than a fortified city, and disputes are like
the barred gates of a citadel.
20From the fruit of his mouth a man's
stomach is filled; with the harvest from
his lips he is satisfied.
21The tongue has the power of life and
death, and those who love it will eat its
fruit.
22He who finds a wife finds what is good
and receives favor from the Lord .
23A poor man pleads for mercy, but a
rich man answers harshly.
24A man of many companions may
come to ruin, but there is a friend who
sticks closer than a brother.
19Better a poor man whose walk is
blameless than a fool whose lips are
perverse.
2It is not good to have zeal without
knowledge, nor to be hasty and miss the
way.
3A man's own folly ruins his life, yet his
heart rages against the Lord .
4Wealth brings many friends, but a poor
man's friend deserts him.
5A false witness will not go unpunished,
and he who pours out lies will not go
free.
6Many curry favor with a ruler, and
everyone is the friend of a man who
gives gifts.
7A poor man is shunned by all his
relatives- how much more do his friends
avoid him! Though he pursues them
with pleading, they are nowhere to be
found.
8He who gets wisdom loves his own
soul; he who cherishes understanding
prospers.
9A false witness will not go unpunished,
and he who pours out lies will perish.
10It is not fitting for a fool to live in
luxury- how much worse for a slave to
rule over princes!
11A man's wisdom gives him patience; it
is to his glory to overlook an offense.
12A king's rage is like the roar of a lion,
but his favor is like dew on the grass.
13A foolish son is his father's ruin, and a
quarrelsome wife is like a constant
dripping.
14Houses and wealth are inherited from
parents, but a prudent wife is from the
Lord .
15Laziness brings on deep sleep, and
the shiftless man goes hungry.
16He who obeys instructions guards his
life, but he who is contemptuous of his
ways will die.
17He who is kind to the poor lends to the
Lord , and he will reward him for what
he has done.
18Discipline your son, for in that there is
hope; do not be a willing party to his
death.
19A hot-tempered man must pay the
penalty; if you rescue him, you will have
to do it again.
20Listen to advice and accept instruction,
and in the end you will be wise.
21Many are the plans in a man's heart,
but it is the Lord 's purpose that prevails.
22What a man desires is unfailing love ;
better to be poor than a liar.
23The fear of the Lord leads to life: Then
one rests content, untouched by trouble.
24The sluggard buries his hand in the
dish; he will not even bring it back to his
mouth!
25Flog a mocker, and the simple will
learn prudence; rebuke a discerning
man, and he will gain knowledge.
26He who robs his father and drives out
his mother is a son who brings shame
and disgrace.
27Stop listening to instruction, my son,
and you will stray from the words of
knowledge.
28A corrupt witness mocks at justice,
and the mouth of the wicked gulps down
evil.
29Penalties are prepared for mockers,
and beatings for the backs of fools.
20Wine is a mocker and beer a
brawler; whoever is led astray by them
is not wise.
2A king's wrath is like the roar of a lion;
he who angers him forfeits his life.
3It is to a man's honor to avoid strife, but
every fool is quick to quarrel.
4A sluggard does not plow in season; so
at harvest time he looks but finds
nothing.
5The purposes of a man's heart are
deep waters, but a man of
understanding draws them out.
6Many a man claims to have unfailing
love, but a faithful man who can find?
7The righteous man leads a blameless
life; blessed are his children after him.
8When a king sits on his throne to judge,
he winnows out all evil with his eyes.
9Who can say, "I have kept my heart
pure; I am clean and without sin"?
10Differing weights and differing
measures- the Lord detests them both.
11Even a child is known by his actions,
by whether his conduct is pure and right.
12Ears that hear and eyes that see- the
Lord has made them both.
13Do not love sleep or you will grow
poor; stay awake and you will have food
to spare.
14"It's no good, it's no good!" says the
buyer; then off he goes and boasts
about his purchase.
15Gold there is, and rubies in abundance,
but lips that speak knowledge are a rare
jewel.
16Take the garment of one who puts up
security for a stranger; hold it in pledge
if he does it for a wayward woman.
17Food gained by fraud tastes sweet to a
man, but he ends up with a mouth full of
gravel.
18Make plans by seeking advice; if you
wage war, obtain guidance.
19A gossip betrays a confidence; so
avoid a man who talks too much.
20If a man curses his father or mother,
his lamp will be snuffed out in pitch
darkness.
21An inheritance quickly gained at the
beginning will not be blessed at the end.
22Do not say, "I'll pay you back for this
wrong!" Wait for the Lord , and he will
deliver you.
23The Lord detests differing weights, and
dishonest scales do not please him.
24A man's steps are directed by the
Lord . How then can anyone understand
his own way?
25It is a trap for a man to dedicate
something rashly and only later to
consider his vows.
26A wise king winnows out the wicked;
he drives the threshing wheel over them.
27The lamp of the Lord searches the
spirit of a man ; it searches out his
inmost being.
28Love and faithfulness keep a king
safe; through love his throne is made
secure.
29The glory of young men is their
strength, gray hair the splendor of the
old.
30Blows and wounds cleanse away evil,
and beatings purge the inmost being.
21The king's heart is in the hand of
the Lord ; he directs it like a watercourse
wherever he pleases.
2All a man's ways seem right to him, but
the Lord weighs the heart.
3To do what is right and just is more
acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.
4Haughty eyes and a proud heart, the
lamp of the wicked, are sin!
5The plans of the diligent lead to profit
as surely as haste leads to poverty.
6A fortune made by a lying tongue is a
fleeting vapor and a deadly snare.
7The violence of the wicked will drag
them away, for they refuse to do what is
right.
8The way of the guilty is devious, but the
conduct of the innocent is upright.
9Better to live on a corner of the roof
than share a house with a quarrelsome
wife.
10The wicked man craves evil; his
neighbor gets no mercy from him.
11When a mocker is punished, the
simple gain wisdom; when a wise man
is instructed, he gets knowledge.
12The Righteous One takes note of the
house of the wicked and brings the
wicked to ruin.
13If a man shuts his ears to the cry of the
poor, he too will cry out and not be
answered.
14A gift given in secret soothes anger,
and a bribe concealed in the cloak
pacifies great wrath.
15When justice is done, it brings joy to
the righteous but terror to evildoers.
16A man who strays from the path of
understanding comes to rest in the
company of the dead.
17He who loves pleasure will become
poor; whoever loves wine and oil will
never be rich.
18The wicked become a ransom for the
righteous, and the unfaithful for the
upright.
19Better to live in a desert than with a
quarrelsome and ill-tempered wife.
20In the house of the wise are stores of
choice food and oil, but a foolish man
devours all he has.
21He who pursues righteousness and
love finds life, prosperity and honor.
22A wise man attacks the city of the
mighty and pulls down the stronghold in
which they trust.
23He who guards his mouth and his
tongue keeps himself from calamity.
24The proud and arrogant man-"Mocker"
is his name; he behaves with
overweening pride.
25The sluggard's craving will be the
death of him, because his hands refuse
to work.
26All day long he craves for more, but
the righteous give without sparing.
27The sacrifice of the wicked is
detestable- how much more so when
brought with evil intent!
28A false witness will perish, and
whoever listens to him will be destroyed
forever.
29A wicked man puts up a bold front, but
an upright man gives thought to his
ways.
30There is no wisdom, no insight, no
plan that can succeed against the Lord .
31The horse is made ready for the day of
battle, but victory rests with the Lord .
22A good name is more desirable
than great riches; to be esteemed is
better than silver or gold.
2Rich and poor have this in common:
The Lord is the Maker of them all.
3A prudent man sees danger and takes
refuge, but the simple keep going and
suffer for it.
4Humility and the fear of the Lord bring
wealth and honor and life.
5In the paths of the wicked lie thorns and
snares, but he who guards his soul
stays far from them.
6Train a child in the way he should go,
and when he is old he will not turn from
it.
7The rich rule over the poor, and the
borrower is servant to the lender.
8He who sows wickedness reaps trouble,
and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.
9A generous man will himself be blessed,
for he shares his food with the poor.
10Drive out the mocker, and out goes
strife; quarrels and insults are ended.
11He who loves a pure heart and whose
speech is gracious will have the king for
his friend.
12The eyes of the Lord keep watch over
knowledge, but he frustrates the words
of the unfaithful.
13The sluggard says, "There is a lion
outside!" or, "I will be murdered in the
streets!"
14The mouth of an adulteress is a deep
pit; he who is under the Lord 's wrath will
fall into it.
15Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,
but the rod of discipline will drive it far
from him.
16He who oppresses the poor to
increase his wealth and he who gives
gifts to the rich-both come to poverty.
Sayings of the Wise
17Pay attention and listen to the sayings
of the wise; apply your heart to what I
teach,
18for it is pleasing when you keep them
in your heart and have all of them ready
on your lips.
19So that your trust may be in the Lord ,
I teach you today, even you.
20Have I not written thirty sayings for you,
sayings of counsel and knowledge,
21teaching you true and reliable words,
so that you can give sound answers to
him who sent you?
22Do not exploit the poor because they
are poor and do not crush the needy in
court,
23for the Lord will take up their case and
will plunder those who plunder them.
24Do not make friends with a hottempered
man, do not associate with
one easily angered,
25or you may learn his ways and get
yourself ensnared.
26Do not be a man who strikes hands in
pledge or puts up security for debts;
27if you lack the means to pay, your very
bed will be snatched from under you.
28Do not move an ancient boundary
stone set up by your forefathers.
29Do you see a man skilled in his work?
He will serve before kings; he will not
serve before obscure men.
23When you sit to dine with a ruler,
note well what is before you,
2and put a knife to your throat if you are
given to gluttony.
3Do not crave his delicacies, for that
food is deceptive.
4Do not wear yourself out to get rich;
have the wisdom to show restraint.
5Cast but a glance at riches, and they
are gone, for they will surely sprout
wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle.
6Do not eat the food of a stingy man, do
not crave his delicacies;
7for he is the kind of man who is always
thinking about the cost. "Eat and drink,"
he says to you, but his heart is not with
you.
8You will vomit up the little you have
eaten and will have wasted your
compliments.
9Do not speak to a fool, for he will scorn
the wisdom of your words.
10Do not move an ancient boundary
stone or encroach on the fields of the
fatherless,
11for their Defender is strong; he will
take up their case against you.
12Apply your heart to instruction and
your ears to words of knowledge.
13Do not withhold discipline from a child;
if you punish him with the rod, he will not
die.
14Punish him with the rod and save his
soul from death.
15My son, if your heart is wise, then my
heart will be glad;
16my inmost being will rejoice when your
lips speak what is right.
17Do not let your heart envy sinners, but
always be zealous for the fear of the
Lord .
18There is surely a future hope for you,
and your hope will not be cut off.
19Listen, my son, and be wise, and keep
your heart on the right path.
20Do not join those who drink too much
wine or gorge themselves on meat,
21for drunkards and gluttons become
poor, and drowsiness clothes them in
rags.
22Listen to your father, who gave you life,
and do not despise your mother when
she is old.
23Buy the truth and do not sell it; get
wisdom, discipline and understanding.
24The father of a righteous man has
great joy; he who has a wise son
delights in him.
25May your father and mother be glad;
may she who gave you birth rejoice!
26My son, give me your heart and let
your eyes keep to my ways,
27for a prostitute is a deep pit and a
wayward wife is a narrow well.
28Like a bandit she lies in wait, and
multiplies the unfaithful among men.
29Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who
has strife? Who has complaints? Who
has needless bruises? Who has
bloodshot eyes?
30Those who linger over wine, who go to
sample bowls of mixed wine.
31Do not gaze at wine when it is red,
when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes
down smoothly!
32In the end it bites like a snake and
poisons like a viper.
33Your eyes will see strange sights and
your mind imagine confusing things.
34You will be like one sleeping on the
high seas, lying on top of the rigging.
35"They hit me," you will say, "but I'm not
hurt! They beat me, but I don't feel it!
When will I wake up so I can find
another drink?"
24Do not envy wicked men, do not
desire their company;
2for their hearts plot violence, and their
lips talk about making trouble.
3By wisdom a house is built, and
through understanding it is established;
4through knowledge its rooms are filled
with rare and beautiful treasures.
5A wise man has great power, and a
man of knowledge increases strength;
6for waging war you need guidance, and
for victory many advisers.
7Wisdom is too high for a fool; in the
assembly at the gate he has nothing to
say.
8He who plots evil will be known as a
schemer.
9The schemes of folly are sin, and men
detest a mocker.
10If you falter in times of trouble, how
small is your strength!
11Rescue those being led away to death;
hold back those staggering toward
slaughter.
12If you say, "But we knew nothing about
this," does not he who weighs the heart
perceive it? Does not he who guards
your life know it? Will he not repay each
person according to what he has done?
13Eat honey, my son, for it is good;
honey from the comb is sweet to your
taste.
14Know also that wisdom is sweet to
your soul; if you find it, there is a future
hope for you, and your hope will not be
cut off.
15Do not lie in wait like an outlaw against
a righteous man's house, do not raid his
dwelling place;
16for though a righteous man falls seven
times, he rises again, but the wicked are
brought down by calamity.
17Do not gloat when your enemy falls;
when he stumbles, do not let your heart
rejoice,
18or the Lord will see and disapprove
and turn his wrath away from him.
19Do not fret because of evil men or be
envious of the wicked,
20for the evil man has no future hope,
and the lamp of the wicked will be
snuffed out.
21Fear the Lord and the king, my son,
and do not join with the rebellious,
22for those two will send sudden
destruction upon them, and who knows
what calamities they can bring? Further
Sayings of the Wise
23These also are sayings of the wise: To
show partiality in judging is not good:
24Whoever says to the guilty, "You are
innocent"- peoples will curse him and
nations denounce him.
25But it will go well with those who
convict the guilty, and rich blessing will
come upon them.
26An honest answer is like a kiss on the
lips.
27Finish your outdoor work and get your
fields ready; after that, build your house.
28Do not testify against your neighbor
without cause, or use your lips to
deceive.
29Do not say, "I'll do to him as he has
done to me; I'll pay that man back for
what he did."
30I went past the field of the sluggard,
past the vineyard of the man who lacks
judgment;
31thorns had come up everywhere, the
ground was covered with weeds, and
the stone wall was in ruins.
32I applied my heart to what I observed
and learned a lesson from what I saw:
33A little sleep, a little slumber, a little
folding of the hands to rest34and
poverty will come on you like a
bandit and scarcity like an armed man.
25These are more proverbs of
Solomon, copied by the men of
Hezekiah king of Judah:
2It is the glory of God to conceal a
matter; to search out a matter is the
glory of kings.
3As the heavens are high and the earth
is deep, so the hearts of kings are
unsearchable.
4Remove the dross from the silver, and
out comes material for the silversmith;
5remove the wicked from the king's
presence, and his throne will be
established through righteousness.
6Do not exalt yourself in the king's
presence, and do not claim a place
among great men;
7it is better for him to say to you, "Come
up here," than for him to humiliate you
before a nobleman. What you have
seen with your eyes
8do not bring hastily to court, for what
will you do in the end if your neighbor
puts you to shame?
9If you argue your case with a neighbor,
do not betray another man's confidence,
10or he who hears it may shame you and
you will never lose your bad reputation.
11A word aptly spoken is like apples of
gold in settings of silver.
12Like an earring of gold or an ornament
of fine gold is a wise man's rebuke to a
listening ear.
13Like the coolness of snow at harvest
time is a trustworthy messenger to those
who send him; he refreshes the spirit of
his masters.
14Like clouds and wind without rain is a
man who boasts of gifts he does not
give.
15Through patience a ruler can be
persuaded, and a gentle tongue can
break a bone.
16If you find honey, eat just enough- too
much of it, and you will vomit.
17Seldom set foot in your neighbor's
house- too much of you, and he will hate
you.
18Like a club or a sword or a sharp
arrow is the man who gives false
testimony against his neighbor.
19Like a bad tooth or a lame foot is
reliance on the unfaithful in times of
trouble.
20Like one who takes away a garment
on a cold day, or like vinegar poured on
soda, is one who sings songs to a heavy
heart.
21If your enemy is hungry, give him food
to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to
drink.
22In doing this, you will heap burning
coals on his head, and the Lord will
reward you.
23As a north wind brings rain, so a sly
tongue brings angry looks.
24Better to live on a corner of the roof
than share a house with a quarrelsome
wife.
25Like cold water to a weary soul is good
news from a distant land.
26Like a muddied spring or a polluted
well is a righteous man who gives way
to the wicked.
27It is not good to eat too much honey,
nor is it honorable to seek one's own
honor.
28Like a city whose walls are broken
down is a man who lacks self-control.
26Like snow in summer or rain in
harvest, honor is not fitting for a fool.
2Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting
swallow, an undeserved curse does not
come to rest.
3A whip for the horse, a halter for the
donkey, and a rod for the backs of fools!
4Do not answer a fool according to his
folly, or you will be like him yourself.
5Answer a fool according to his folly, or
he will be wise in his own eyes.
6Like cutting off one's feet or drinking
violence is the sending of a message by
the hand of a fool.
7Like a lame man's legs that hang limp
is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
8Like tying a stone in a sling is the giving
of honor to a fool.
9Like a thornbush in a drunkard's hand
is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
10Like an archer who wounds at random
is he who hires a fool or any passer-by.
11As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool
repeats his folly.
12Do you see a man wise in his own
eyes? There is more hope for a fool
than for him.
13The sluggard says, "There is a lion in
the road, a fierce lion roaming the
streets!"
14As a door turns on its hinges, so a
sluggard turns on his bed.
15The sluggard buries his hand in the
dish; he is too lazy to bring it back to his
mouth.
16The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes
than seven men who answer discreetly.
17Like one who seizes a dog by the ears
is a passer-by who meddles in a quarrel
not his own.
18Like a madman shooting firebrands or
deadly arrows
19is a man who deceives his neighbor
and says, "I was only joking!"
20Without wood a fire goes out; without
gossip a quarrel dies down.
21As charcoal to embers and as wood to
fire, so is a quarrelsome man for
kindling strife.
22The words of a gossip are like choice
morsels; they go down to a man's
inmost parts.
23Like a coating of glaze over
earthenware are fervent lips with an evil
heart.
24A malicious man disguises himself
with his lips, but in his heart he harbors
deceit.
25Though his speech is charming, do not
believe him, for seven abominations fill
his heart.
26His malice may be concealed by
deception, but his wickedness will be
exposed in the assembly.
27If a man digs a pit, he will fall into it; if
a man rolls a stone, it will roll back on
him.
28A lying tongue hates those it hurts,
and a flattering mouth works ruin.
27Do not boast about tomorrow, for
you do not know what a day may bring
forth.
2Let another praise you, and not your
own mouth; someone else, and not your
own lips.
3Stone is heavy and sand a burden, but
provocation by a fool is heavier than
both.
4Anger is cruel and fury overwhelming,
but who can stand before jealousy?
5Better is open rebuke than hidden love.
6Wounds from a friend can be trusted,
but an enemy multiplies kisses.
7He who is full loathes honey, but to the
hungry even what is bitter tastes sweet.
8Like a bird that strays from its nest is a
man who strays from his home.
9Perfume and incense bring joy to the
heart, and the pleasantness of one's
friend springs from his earnest counsel.
10Do not forsake your friend and the
friend of your father, and do not go to
your brother's house when disaster
strikes you- better a neighbor nearby
than a brother far away.
11Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my
heart; then I can answer anyone who
treats me with contempt.
12The prudent see danger and take
refuge, but the simple keep going and
suffer for it.
13Take the garment of one who puts up
security for a stranger; hold it in pledge
if he does it for a wayward woman.
14If a man loudly blesses his neighbor
early in the morning, it will be taken as a
curse.
15A quarrelsome wife is like a constant
dripping on a rainy day;
16restraining her is like restraining the
wind or grasping oil with the hand.
17As iron sharpens iron, so one man
sharpens another.
18He who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,
and he who looks after his master will
be honored.
19As water reflects a face, so a man's
heart reflects the man.
20Death and Destruction are never
satisfied, and neither are the eyes of
man.
21The crucible for silver and the furnace
for gold, but man is tested by the praise
he receives.
22Though you grind a fool in a mortar,
grinding him like grain with a pestle, you
will not remove his folly from him.
23Be sure you know the condition of your
flocks, give careful attention to your
herds;
24for riches do not endure forever, and a
crown is not secure for all generations.
25When the hay is removed and new
growth appears and the grass from the
hills is gathered in,
26the lambs will provide you with clothing,
and the goats with the price of a field.
27You will have plenty of goats' milk to
feed you and your family and to nourish
your servant girls.
28The wicked man flees though no
one pursues, but the righteous are as
bold as a lion.
2When a country is rebellious, it has
many rulers, but a man of understanding
and knowledge maintains order.
3A ruler who oppresses the poor is like a
driving rain that leaves no crops.
4Those who forsake the law praise the
wicked, but those who keep the law
resist them.
5Evil men do not understand justice, but
those who seek the Lord understand it
fully.
6Better a poor man whose walk is
blameless than a rich man whose ways
are perverse.
7He who keeps the law is a discerning
son, but a companion of gluttons
disgraces his father.
8He who increases his wealth by
exorbitant interest amasses it for
another, who will be kind to the poor.
9If anyone turns a deaf ear to the law,
even his prayers are detestable.
10He who leads the upright along an evil
path will fall into his own trap, but the
blameless will receive a good
inheritance.
11A rich man may be wise in his own
eyes, but a poor man who has
discernment sees through him.
12When the righteous triumph, there is
great elation; but when the wicked rise
to power, men go into hiding.
13He who conceals his sins does not
prosper, but whoever confesses and
renounces them finds mercy.
14Blessed is the man who always fears
the Lord , but he who hardens his heart
falls into trouble.
15Like a roaring lion or a charging bear
is a wicked man ruling over a helpless
people.
16A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment, but
he who hates ill-gotten gain will enjoy a
long life.
17A man tormented by the guilt of
murder will be a fugitive till death; let no
one support him.
18He whose walk is blameless is kept
safe, but he whose ways are perverse
will suddenly fall.
19He who works his land will have
abundant food, but the one who chases
fantasies will have his fill of poverty.
20A faithful man will be richly blessed,
but one eager to get rich will not go
unpunished.
21To show partiality is not good- yet a
man will do wrong for a piece of bread.
22A stingy man is eager to get rich and is
unaware that poverty awaits him.
23He who rebukes a man will in the end
gain more favor than he who has a
flattering tongue.
24He who robs his father or mother and
says, "It's not wrong"- he is partner to
him who destroys.
25A greedy man stirs up dissension, but
he who trusts in the Lord will prosper.
26He who trusts in himself is a fool, but
he who walks in wisdom is kept safe.
27He who gives to the poor will lack
nothing, but he who closes his eyes to
them receives many curses.
28When the wicked rise to power, people
go into hiding; but when the wicked
perish, the righteous thrive.
29A man who remains stiff-necked
after many rebukes will suddenly be
destroyed-without remedy.
2When the righteous thrive, the people
rejoice; when the wicked rule, the
people groan.
3A man who loves wisdom brings joy to
his father, but a companion of
prostitutes squanders his wealth.
4By justice a king gives a country
stability, but one who is greedy for
bribes tears it down.
5Whoever flatters his neighbor is
spreading a net for his feet.
6An evil man is snared by his own sin,
but a righteous one can sing and be
glad.
7The righteous care about justice for the
poor, but the wicked have no such
concern.
8Mockers stir up a city, but wise men
turn away anger.
9If a wise man goes to court with a fool,
the fool rages and scoffs, and there is
no peace.
10Bloodthirsty men hate a man of
integrity and seek to kill the upright.
11A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a
wise man keeps himself under control.
12If a ruler listens to lies, all his officials
become wicked.
13The poor man and the oppressor have
this in common: The Lord gives sight to
the eyes of both.
14If a king judges the poor with fairness,
his throne will always be secure.
15The rod of correction imparts wisdom,
but a child left to himself disgraces his
mother.
16When the wicked thrive, so does sin,
but the righteous will see their downfall.
17Discipline your son, and he will give
you peace; he will bring delight to your
soul.
18Where there is no revelation, the
people cast off restraint; but blessed is
he who keeps the law.
19A servant cannot be corrected by mere
words; though he understands, he will
not respond.
20Do you see a man who speaks in
haste? There is more hope for a fool
than for him.
21If a man pampers his servant from
youth, he will bring grief in the end.
22An angry man stirs up dissension, and
a hot-tempered one commits many sins.
23A man's pride brings him low, but a
man of lowly spirit gains honor.
24The accomplice of a thief is his own
enemy; he is put under oath and dare
not testify.
25Fear of man will prove to be a snare,
but whoever trusts in the Lord is kept
safe.
26Many seek an audience with a ruler,
but it is from the Lord that man gets
justice.
27The righteous detest the dishonest;
the wicked detest the upright.
30The sayings of Agur son of Jakehan
oracle : This man declared to Ithiel,
to Ithiel and to Ucal:
2"I am the most ignorant of men; I do not
have a man's understanding.
3I have not learned wisdom, nor have I
knowledge of the Holy One.
4Who has gone up to heaven and come
down? Who has gathered up the wind in
the hollow of his hands? Who has
wrapped up the waters in his cloak?
Who has established all the ends of the
earth? What is his name, and the name
of his son? Tell me if you know!
5"Every word of God is flawless; he is a
shield to those who take refuge in him.
6Do not add to his words, or he will
rebuke you and prove you a liar.
7"Two things I ask of you, O Lord ; do
not refuse me before I die:
8Keep falsehood and lies far from me;
give me neither poverty nor riches, but
give me only my daily bread.
9Otherwise, I may have too much and
disown you and say, 'Who is the Lord ?'
Or I may become poor and steal, and so
dishonor the name of my God.
10"Do not slander a servant to his master,
or he will curse you, and you will pay for
it.
11"There are those who curse their
fathers and do not bless their mothers;
12those who are pure in their own eyes
and yet are not cleansed of their filth;
13those whose eyes are ever so haughty,
whose glances are so disdainful;
14those whose teeth are swords and
whose jaws are set with knives to
devour the poor from the earth, the
needy from among mankind.
15"The leech has two daughters. 'Give!
Give!' they cry. "There are three things
that are never satisfied, four that never
say, 'Enough!':
16the grave, the barren womb, land,
which is never satisfied with water, and
fire, which never says, 'Enough!'
17"The eye that mocks a father, that
scorns obedience to a mother, will be
pecked out by the ravens of the valley,
will be eaten by the vultures.
18"There are three things that are too
amazing for me, four that I do not
understand:
19the way of an eagle in the sky, the way
of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship
on the high seas, and the way of a man
with a maiden.
20"This is the way of an adulteress: She
eats and wipes her mouth and says,
'I've done nothing wrong.'
21"Under three things the earth trembles,
under four it cannot bear up:
22a servant who becomes king, a fool
who is full of food,
23an unloved woman who is married,
and a maidservant who displaces her
mistress.
24"Four things on earth are small, yet
they are extremely wise:
25Ants are creatures of little strength, yet
they store up their food in the summer;
26coneys are creatures of little power,
yet they make their home in the crags;
27locusts have no king, yet they advance
together in ranks;
28a lizard can be caught with the hand,
yet it is found in kings' palaces.
29"There are three things that are stately
in their stride, four that move with stately
bearing:
30a lion, mighty among beasts, who
retreats before nothing;
31a strutting rooster, a he-goat, and a
king with his army around him.
32"If you have played the fool and
exalted yourself, or if you have planned
evil, clap your hand over your mouth!
33For as churning the milk produces
butter, and as twisting the nose
produces blood, so stirring up anger
produces strife."
31The sayings of King Lemuel-an
oracle his mother taught him:
2"O my son, O son of my womb, O son
of my vows,
3do not spend your strength on women,
your vigor on those who ruin kings.
4"It is not for kings, O Lemuel- not for
kings to drink wine, not for rulers to
crave beer,
5lest they drink and forget what the law
decrees, and deprive all the oppressed
of their rights.
6Give beer to those who are perishing,
wine to those who are in anguish;
7let them drink and forget their poverty
and remember their misery no more.
8"Speak up for those who cannot speak
for themselves, for the rights of all who
are destitute.
9Speak up and judge fairly; defend the
rights of the poor and needy." Epilogue:
The Wife of Noble Character
10A wife of noble character who can
find? She is worth far more than rubies.
11Her husband has full confidence in her
and lacks nothing of value.
12She brings him good, not harm, all the
days of her life.
13She selects wool and flax and works
with eager hands.
14She is like the merchant ships,
bringing her food from afar.
15She gets up while it is still dark; she
provides food for her family and portions
for her servant girls.
16She considers a field and buys it; out
of her earnings she plants a vineyard.
17She sets about her work vigorously;
her arms are strong for her tasks.
18She sees that her trading is profitable,
and her lamp does not go out at night.
19In her hand she holds the distaff and
grasps the spindle with her fingers.
20She opens her arms to the poor and
extends her hands to the needy.
21When it snows, she has no fear for her
household; for all of them are clothed in
scarlet.
22She makes coverings for her bed; she
is clothed in fine linen and purple.
23Her husband is respected at the city
gate, where he takes his seat among
the elders of the land.
24She makes linen garments and sells
them, and supplies the merchants with
sashes.
25She is clothed with strength and
dignity; she can laugh at the days to
come.
26She speaks with wisdom, and faithful
instruction is on her tongue.
27She watches over the affairs of her
household and does not eat the bread of
idleness.
28Her children arise and call her
blessed; her husband also, and he
praises her:
29"Many women do noble things, but you
surpass them all."
30Charm is deceptive, and beauty is
fleeting; but a woman who fears the
Lord is to be praised.
31Give her the reward she has earned,
and let her works bring her praise at the
city gate.
Ecclesiastes
1The words of the Teacher, son of
David, king in Jerusalem:
2"Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the
Teacher. "Utterly meaningless!
Everything is meaningless."
3What does man gain from all his labor
at which he toils under the sun?
4Generations come and generations go,
but the earth remains forever.
5The sun rises and the sun sets, and
hurries back to where it rises.
6The wind blows to the south and turns
to the north; round and round it goes,
ever returning on its course.
7All streams flow into the sea, yet the
sea is never full. To the place the
streams come from, there they return
again.
8All things are wearisome, more than
one can say. The eye never has enough
of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing.
9What has been will be again, what has
been done will be done again; there is
nothing new under the sun.
10Is there anything of which one can say,
"Look! This is something new"? It was
here already, long ago; it was here
before our time.
11There is no remembrance of men of
old, and even those who are yet to
come will not be remembered by those
who follow.
12I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in
Jerusalem.
13I devoted myself to study and to
explore by wisdom all that is done under
heaven. What a heavy burden God has
laid on men!
14I have seen all the things that are done
under the sun; all of them are
meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
15What is twisted cannot be
straightened; what is lacking cannot be
counted.
16I thought to myself, "Look, I have
grown and increased in wisdom more
than anyone who has ruled over
Jerusalem before me; I have
experienced much of wisdom and
knowledge."
17Then I applied myself to the
understanding of wisdom, and also of
madness and folly, but I learned that this,
too, is a chasing after the wind.
18For with much wisdom comes much
sorrow; the more knowledge, the more
grief.
2I thought in my heart, "Come now, I
will test you with pleasure to find out
what is good." But that also proved to be
meaningless.
2"Laughter," I said, "is foolish. And what
does pleasure accomplish?"
3I tried cheering myself with wine, and
embracing folly-my mind still guiding me
with wisdom. I wanted to see what was
worthwhile for men to do under heaven
during the few days of their lives.
4I undertook great projects: I built
houses for myself and planted vineyards.
5I made gardens and parks and planted
all kinds of fruit trees in them.
6I made reservoirs to water groves of
flourishing trees.
7I bought male and female slaves and
had other slaves who were born in my
house. I also owned more herds and
flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before
me.
8I amassed silver and gold for myself,
and the treasure of kings and provinces.
I acquired men and women singers, and
a harem as well-the delights of the heart
of man.
9I became greater by far than anyone in
Jerusalem before me. In all this my
wisdom stayed with me.
10I denied myself nothing my eyes
desired; I refused my heart no pleasure.
My heart took delight in all my work, and
this was the reward for all my labor.
11Yet when I surveyed all that my hands
had done and what I had toiled to
achieve, everything was meaningless, a
chasing after the wind; nothing was
gained under the sun.
12Then I turned my thoughts to consider
wisdom, and also madness and folly.
What more can the king's successor do
than what has already been done?
13I saw that wisdom is better than folly,
just as light is better than darkness.
14The wise man has eyes in his head,
while the fool walks in the darkness; but
I came to realize that the same fate
overtakes them both.
15Then I thought in my heart, "The fate
of the fool will overtake me also. What
then do I gain by being wise?" I said in
my heart, "This too is meaningless."
16For the wise man, like the fool, will not
be long remembered; in days to come
both will be forgotten. Like the fool, the
wise man too must die!
17So I hated life, because the work that
is done under the sun was grievous to
me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing
after the wind.
18I hated all the things I had toiled for
under the sun, because I must leave
them to the one who comes after me.
19And who knows whether he will be a
wise man or a fool? Yet he will have
control over all the work into which I
have poured my effort and skill under
the sun. This too is meaningless.
20So my heart began to despair over all
my toilsome labor under the sun.
21For a man may do his work with
wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then
he must leave all he owns to someone
who has not worked for it. This too is
meaningless and a great misfortune.
22What does a man get for all the toil
and anxious striving with which he
labors under the sun?
23All his days his work is pain and grief;
even at night his mind does not rest.
This too is meaningless.
24A man can do nothing better than to
eat and drink and find satisfaction in his
work. This too, I see, is from the hand of
God,
25for without him, who can eat or find
enjoyment?
26To the man who pleases him, God
gives wisdom, knowledge and
happiness, but to the sinner he gives the
task of gathering and storing up wealth
to hand it over to the one who pleases
God. This too is meaningless, a chasing
after the wind.
3There is a time for everything, and a
season for every activity under heaven:
2a time to be born and a time to die, a
time to plant and a time to uproot,
3a time to kill and a time to heal, a time
to tear down and a time to build,
4a time to weep and a time to laugh, a
time to mourn and a time to dance,
5a time to scatter stones and a time to
gather them, a time to embrace and a
time to refrain,
6a time to search and a time to give up,
a time to keep and a time to throw away,
7a time to tear and a time to mend, a
time to be silent and a time to speak,
8a time to love and a time to hate, a time
for war and a time for peace.
9What does the worker gain from his
toil?
10I have seen the burden God has laid
on men.
11He has made everything beautiful in its
time. He has also set eternity in the
hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom
what God has done from beginning to
end.
12I know that there is nothing better for
men than to be happy and do good
while they live.
13That everyone may eat and drink, and
find satisfaction in all his toil-this is the
gift of God.
14I know that everything God does will
endure forever; nothing can be added to
it and nothing taken from it. God does it
so that men will revere him.
15Whatever is has already been, and
what will be has been before; and God
will call the past to account.
16And I saw something else under the
sun: In the place of judgmentwickedness
was there, in the place of
justice-wickedness was there.
17I thought in my heart, "God will bring to
judgment both the righteous and the
wicked, for there will be a time for every
activity, a time for every deed."
18I also thought, "As for men, God tests
them so that they may see that they are
like the animals.
19Man's fate is like that of the animals;
the same fate awaits them both: As one
dies, so dies the other. All have the
same breath ; man has no advantage
over the animal. Everything is
meaningless.
20All go to the same place; all come from
dust, and to dust all return.
21Who knows if the spirit of man rises
upward and if the spirit of the animal
goes down into the earth?"
22So I saw that there is nothing better for
a man than to enjoy his work, because
that is his lot. For who can bring him to
see what will happen after him?
4Again I looked and saw all the
oppression that was taking place under
the sun: I saw the tears of the
oppressed- and they have no comforter;
power was on the side of their
oppressors- and they have no comforter.
2And I declared that the dead, who had
already died, are happier than the living,
who are still alive.
3But better than both is he who has not
yet been, who has not seen the evil that
is done under the sun.
4And I saw that all labor and all
achievement spring from man's envy of
his neighbor. This too is meaningless, a
chasing after the wind.
5The fool folds his hands and ruins
himself.
6Better one handful with tranquillity than
two handfuls with toil and chasing after
the wind.
7Again I saw something meaningless
under the sun:
8There was a man all alone; he had
neither son nor brother. There was no
end to his toil, yet his eyes were not
content with his wealth. "For whom am I
toiling," he asked, "and why am I
depriving myself of enjoyment?" This too
is meaningless- a miserable business!
9Two are better than one, because they
have a good return for their work:
10If one falls down, his friend can help
him up. But pity the man who falls and
has no one to help him up!
11Also, if two lie down together, they will
keep warm. But how can one keep
warm alone?
12Though one may be overpowered, two
can defend themselves. A cord of three
strands is not quickly broken.
13Better a poor but wise youth than an
old but foolish king who no longer knows
how to take warning.
14The youth may have come from prison
to the kingship, or he may have been
born in poverty within his kingdom.
15I saw that all who lived and walked
under the sun followed the youth, the
king's successor.
16There was no end to all the people
who were before them. But those who
came later were not pleased with the
successor. This too is meaningless, a
chasing after the wind.
5Guard your steps when you go to the
house of God. Go near to listen rather
than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who
do not know that they do wrong.
2Do not be quick with your mouth, do not
be hasty in your heart to utter anything
before God. God is in heaven and you
are on earth, so let your words be few.
3As a dream comes when there are
many cares, so the speech of a fool
when there are many words.
4When you make a vow to God, do not
delay in fulfilling it. He has no pleasure
in fools; fulfill your vow.
5It is better not to vow than to make a
vow and not fulfill it.
6Do not let your mouth lead you into sin.
And do not protest to the temple
messenger, "My vow was a mistake."
Why should God be angry at what you
say and destroy the work of your
hands?
7Much dreaming and many words are
meaningless. Therefore stand in awe of
God.
8If you see the poor oppressed in a
district, and justice and rights denied, do
not be surprised at such things; for one
official is eyed by a higher one, and over
them both are others higher still.
9The increase from the land is taken by
all; the king himself profits from the
fields.
10Whoever loves money never has
money enough; whoever loves wealth is
never satisfied with his income. This too
is meaningless.
11As goods increase, so do those who
consume them. And what benefit are
they to the owner except to feast his
eyes on them?
12The sleep of a laborer is sweet,
whether he eats little or much, but the
abundance of a rich man permits him no
sleep.
13I have seen a grievous evil under the
sun: wealth hoarded to the harm of its
owner,
14or wealth lost through some misfortune,
so that when he has a son there is
nothing left for him.
15Naked a man comes from his mother's
womb, and as he comes, so he departs.
He takes nothing from his labor that he
can carry in his hand.
16This too is a grievous evil: As a man
comes, so he departs, and what does
he gain, since he toils for the wind?
17All his days he eats in darkness, with
great frustration, affliction and anger.
18Then I realized that it is good and
proper for a man to eat and drink, and to
find satisfaction in his toilsome labor
under the sun during the few days of life
God has given him-for this is his lot.
19Moreover, when God gives any man
wealth and possessions, and enables
him to enjoy them, to accept his lot and
be happy in his work-this is a gift of God.
20He seldom reflects on the days of his
life, because God keeps him occupied
with gladness of heart.
6I have seen another evil under the
sun, and it weighs heavily on men:
2God gives a man wealth, possessions
and honor, so that he lacks nothing his
heart desires, but God does not enable
him to enjoy them, and a stranger
enjoys them instead. This is
meaningless, a grievous evil.
3A man may have a hundred children
and live many years; yet no matter how
long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his
prosperity and does not receive proper
burial, I say that a stillborn child is better
off than he.
4It comes without meaning, it departs in
darkness, and in darkness its name is
shrouded.
5Though it never saw the sun or knew
anything, it has more rest than does that
man-
6even if he lives a thousand years twice
over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do
not all go to the same place?
7All man's efforts are for his mouth, yet
his appetite is never satisfied.
8What advantage has a wise man over a
fool? What does a poor man gain by
knowing how to conduct himself before
others?
9Better what the eye sees than the
roving of the appetite. This too is
meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
10Whatever exists has already been
named, and what man is has been
known; no man can contend with one
who is stronger than he.
11The more the words, the less the
meaning, and how does that profit
anyone?
12For who knows what is good for a man
in life, during the few and meaningless
days he passes through like a shadow?
Who can tell him what will happen under
the sun after he is gone?
7A good name is better than fine
perfume, and the day of death better
than the day of birth.
2It is better to go to a house of mourning
than to go to a house of feasting, for
death is the destiny of every man; the
living should take this to heart.
3Sorrow is better than laughter, because
a sad face is good for the heart.
4The heart of the wise is in the house of
mourning, but the heart of fools is in the
house of pleasure.
5It is better to heed a wise man's rebuke
than to listen to the song of fools.
6Like the crackling of thorns under the
pot, so is the laughter of fools. This too
is meaningless.
7Extortion turns a wise man into a fool,
and a bribe corrupts the heart.
8The end of a matter is better than its
beginning, and patience is better than
pride.
9Do not be quickly provoked in your
spirit, for anger resides in the lap of
fools.
10Do not say, "Why were the old days
better than these?" For it is not wise to
ask such questions.
11Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good
thing and benefits those who see the
sun.
12Wisdom is a shelter as money is a
shelter, but the advantage of knowledge
is this: that wisdom preserves the life of
its possessor.
13Consider what God has done: Who
can straighten what he has made
crooked?
14When times are good, be happy; but
when times are bad, consider: God has
made the one as well as the other.
Therefore, a man cannot discover
anything about his future.
15In this meaningless life of mine I have
seen both of these: a righteous man
perishing in his righteousness, and a
wicked man living long in his
wickedness.
16Do not be overrighteous, neither be
overwise- why destroy yourself?
17Do not be overwicked, and do not be a
fool- why die before your time?
18It is good to grasp the one and not let
go of the other. The man who fears God
will avoid all extremes .
19Wisdom makes one wise man more
powerful than ten rulers in a city.
20There is not a righteous man on earth
who does what is right and never sins.
21Do not pay attention to every word
people say, or you may hear your
servant cursing you-
22for you know in your heart that many
times you yourself have cursed others.
23All this I tested by wisdom and I said,
"I am determined to be wise"- but this
was beyond me.
24Whatever wisdom may be, it is far off
and most profound- who can discover
it?
25So I turned my mind to understand, to
investigate and to search out wisdom
and the scheme of things and to
understand the stupidity of wickedness
and the madness of folly.
26I find more bitter than death the
woman who is a snare, whose heart is a
trap and whose hands are chains. The
man who pleases God will escape her,
but the sinner she will ensnare.
27"Look," says the Teacher, "this is what
I have discovered: "Adding one thing to
another to discover the scheme of
things-
28while I was still searching but not
finding- I found one upright man among
a thousand, but not one upright woman
among them all.
29This only have I found: God made
mankind upright, but men have gone in
search of many schemes."
8Who is like the wise man? Who
knows the explanation of things?
Wisdom brightens a man's face and
changes its hard appearance.
2Obey the king's command, I say,
because you took an oath before God.
3Do not be in a hurry to leave the king's
presence. Do not stand up for a bad
cause, for he will do whatever he
pleases.
4Since a king's word is supreme, who
can say to him, "What are you doing?"
5Whoever obeys his command will come
to no harm, and the wise heart will know
the proper time and procedure.
6For there is a proper time and
procedure for every matter, though a
man's misery weighs heavily upon him.
7Since no man knows the future, who
can tell him what is to come?
8No man has power over the wind to
contain it ; so no one has power over
the day of his death. As no one is
discharged in time of war, so
wickedness will not release those who
practice it.
9All this I saw, as I applied my mind to
everything done under the sun. There is
a time when a man lords it over others
to his own hurt.
10Then too, I saw the wicked buriedthose
who used to come and go from
the holy place and receive praise in the
city where they did this. This too is
meaningless.
11When the sentence for a crime is not
quickly carried out, the hearts of the
people are filled with schemes to do
wrong.
12Although a wicked man commits a
hundred crimes and still lives a long
time, I know that it will go better with
God-fearing men, who are reverent
before God.
13Yet because the wicked do not fear
God, it will not go well with them, and
their days will not lengthen like a
shadow.
14There is something else meaningless
that occurs on earth: righteous men who
get what the wicked deserve, and
wicked men who get what the righteous
deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless.
15So I commend the enjoyment of life,
because nothing is better for a man
under the sun than to eat and drink and
be glad. Then joy will accompany him in
his work all the days of the life God has
given him under the sun.
16When I applied my mind to know
wisdom and to observe man's labor on
earth-his eyes not seeing sleep day or
night-
17then I saw all that God has done. No
one can comprehend what goes on
under the sun. Despite all his efforts to
search it out, man cannot discover its
meaning. Even if a wise man claims he
knows, he cannot really comprehend it.
9So I reflected on all this and
concluded that the righteous and the
wise and what they do are in God's
hands, but no man knows whether love
or hate awaits him.
2All share a common destiny-the
righteous and the wicked, the good and
the bad, the clean and the unclean,
those who offer sacrifices and those
who do not. As it is with the good man,
so with the sinner; as it is with those
who take oaths, so with those who are
afraid to take them.
3This is the evil in everything that
happens under the sun: The same
destiny overtakes all. The hearts of men,
moreover, are full of evil and there is
madness in their hearts while they live,
and afterward they join the dead.
4Anyone who is among the living has
hope -even a live dog is better off than a
dead lion!
5For the living know that they will die,
but the dead know nothing; they have
no further reward, and even the memory
of them is forgotten.
6Their love, their hate and their jealousy
have long since vanished; never again
will they have a part in anything that
happens under the sun.
7Go, eat your food with gladness, and
drink your wine with a joyful heart, for it
is now that God favors what you do.
8Always be clothed in white, and always
anoint your head with oil.
9Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love,
all the days of this meaningless life that
God has given you under the sun- all
your meaningless days. For this is your
lot in life and in your toilsome labor
under the sun.
10Whatever your hand finds to do, do it
with all your might, for in the grave,
where you are going, there is neither
working nor planning nor knowledge nor
wisdom.
11I have seen something else under the
sun: The race is not to the swift or the
battle to the strong, nor does food come
to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or
favor to the learned; but time and
chance happen to them all.
12Moreover, no man knows when his
hour will come: As fish are caught in a
cruel net, or birds are taken in a snare,
so men are trapped by evil times that fall
unexpectedly upon them.
13I also saw under the sun this example
of wisdom that greatly impressed me:
14There was once a small city with only
a few people in it. And a powerful king
came against it, surrounded it and built
huge siegeworks against it.
15Now there lived in that city a man poor
but wise, and he saved the city by his
wisdom. But nobody remembered that
poor man.
16So I said, "Wisdom is better than
strength." But the poor man's wisdom is
despised, and his words are no longer
heeded.
17The quiet words of the wise are more
to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler
of fools.
18Wisdom is better than weapons of war,
but one sinner destroys much good.
10As dead flies give perfume a bad
smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom
and honor.
2The heart of the wise inclines to the
right, but the heart of the fool to the left.
3Even as he walks along the road, the
fool lacks sense and shows everyone
how stupid he is.
4If a ruler's anger rises against you, do
not leave your post; calmness can lay
great errors to rest.
5There is an evil I have seen under the
sun, the sort of error that arises from a
ruler:
6Fools are put in many high positions,
while the rich occupy the low ones.
7I have seen slaves on horseback, while
princes go on foot like slaves.
8Whoever digs a pit may fall into it;
whoever breaks through a wall may be
bitten by a snake.
9Whoever quarries stones may be
injured by them; whoever splits logs
may be endangered by them.
10If the ax is dull and its edge
unsharpened, more strength is needed
but skill will bring success.
11If a snake bites before it is charmed,
there is no profit for the charmer.
12Words from a wise man's mouth are
gracious, but a fool is consumed by his
own lips.
13At the beginning his words are folly; at
the end they are wicked madness-
14and the fool multiplies words. No one
knows what is coming- who can tell him
what will happen after him?
15A fool's work wearies him; he does not
know the way to town.
16Woe to you, O land whose king was a
servant and whose princes feast in the
morning.
17Blessed are you, O land whose king is
of noble birth and whose princes eat at
a proper time- for strength and not for
drunkenness.
18If a man is lazy, the rafters sag; if his
hands are idle, the house leaks.
19A feast is made for laughter, and wine
makes life merry, but money is the
answer for everything.
20Do not revile the king even in your
thoughts, or curse the rich in your
bedroom, because a bird of the air may
carry your words, and a bird on the wing
may report what you say.
11Cast your bread upon the waters,
for after many days you will find it again.
2Give portions to seven, yes to eight, for
you do not know what disaster may
come upon the land.
3If clouds are full of water, they pour rain
upon the earth. Whether a tree falls to
the south or to the north, in the place
where it falls, there will it lie.
4Whoever watches the wind will not
plant; whoever looks at the clouds will
not reap.
5As you do not know the path of the
wind, or how the body is formed in a
mother's womb, so you cannot
understand the work of God, the Maker
of all things.
6Sow your seed in the morning, and at
evening let not your hands be idle, for
you do not know which will succeed,
whether this or that, or whether both will
do equally well.
7Light is sweet, and it pleases the eyes
to see the sun.
8However many years a man may live,
let him enjoy them all. But let him
remember the days of darkness, for they
will be many. Everything to come is
meaningless.
9Be happy, young man, while you are
young, and let your heart give you joy in
the days of your youth. Follow the ways
of your heart and whatever your eyes
see, but know that for all these things
God will bring you to judgment.
10So then, banish anxiety from your
heart and cast off the troubles of your
body, for youth and vigor are
meaningless.
12Remember your Creator in the
days of your youth, before the days of
trouble come and the years approach
when you will say, "I find no pleasure in
them"-
2before the sun and the light and the
moon and the stars grow dark, and the
clouds return after the rain;
3when the keepers of the house tremble,
and the strong men stoop, when the
grinders cease because they are few,
and those looking through the windows
grow dim;
4when the doors to the street are closed
and the sound of grinding fades; when
men rise up at the sound of birds, but all
their songs grow faint;
5when men are afraid of heights and of
dangers in the streets; when the almond
tree blossoms and the grasshopper
drags himself along and desire no
longer is stirred. Then man goes to his
eternal home and mourners go about
the streets.
6Remember him-before the silver cord is
severed, or the golden bowl is broken;
before the pitcher is shattered at the
spring, or the wheel broken at the well,
7and the dust returns to the ground it
came from, and the spirit returns to God
who gave it.
8"Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the
Teacher. "Everything is meaningless!"
9Not only was the Teacher wise, but
also he imparted knowledge to the
people. He pondered and searched out
and set in order many proverbs.
10The Teacher searched to find just the
right words, and what he wrote was
upright and true.
11The words of the wise are like goads,
their collected sayings like firmly
embedded nails-given by one Shepherd.
12Be warned, my son, of anything in
addition to them. Of making many books
there is no end, and much study wearies
the body.
13Now all has been heard; here is the
conclusion of the matter: Fear God and
keep his commandments, for this is the
whole duty of man.
14For God will bring every deed into
judgment, including every hidden thing,
whether it is good or evil.
Song of Solomon
1Solomon's Song of Songs.
2Let him kiss me with the kisses of his
mouth- for your love is more delightful
than wine.
3Pleasing is the fragrance of your
perfumes; your name is like perfume
poured out. No wonder the maidens
love you!
4Take me away with you-let us hurry!
Let the king bring me into his chambers.
We rejoice and delight in you ; we will
praise your love more than wine. How
right they are to adore you!
5Dark am I, yet lovely, O daughters of
Jerusalem, dark like the tents of Kedar,
like the tent curtains of Solomon.
6Do not stare at me because I am dark,
because I am darkened by the sun. My
mother's sons were angry with me and
made me take care of the vineyards; my
own vineyard I have neglected.
7Tell me, you whom I love, where you
graze your flock and where you rest
your sheep at midday. Why should I be
like a veiled woman beside the flocks of
your friends?
8If you do not know, most beautiful of
women, follow the tracks of the sheep
and graze your young goats by the tents
of the shepherds.
9I liken you, my darling, to a mare
harnessed to one of the chariots of
Pharaoh.
10Your cheeks are beautiful with
earrings, your neck with strings of jewels.
11We will make you earrings of gold,
studded with silver.
12While the king was at his table, my
perfume spread its fragrance.
13My lover is to me a sachet of myrrh
resting between my breasts.
14My lover is to me a cluster of henna
blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi.
15How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh,
how beautiful! Your eyes are doves.
16How handsome you are, my lover! Oh,
how charming! And our bed is verdant.
17The beams of our house are cedars;
our rafters are firs.
2I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the
valleys.
2Like a lily among thorns is my darling
among the maidens.
3Like an apple tree among the trees of
the forest is my lover among the young
men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his
fruit is sweet to my taste.
4He has taken me to the banquet hall,
and his banner over me is love.
5Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me
with apples, for I am faint with love.
6His left arm is under my head, and his
right arm embraces me.
7Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you
by the gazelles and by the does of the
field: Do not arouse or awaken love until
it so desires.
8Listen! My lover! Look! Here he comes,
leaping across the mountains, bounding
over the hills.
9My lover is like a gazelle or a young
stag. Look! There he stands behind our
wall, gazing through the windows,
peering through the lattice.
10My lover spoke and said to me, "Arise,
my darling, my beautiful one, and come
with me.
11See! The winter is past; the rains are
over and gone.
12Flowers appear on the earth; the
season of singing has come, the cooing
of doves is heard in our land.
13The fig tree forms its early fruit; the
blossoming vines spread their fragrance.
Arise, come, my darling; my beautiful
one, come with me."
14My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the
hiding places on the mountainside,
show me your face, let me hear your
voice; for your voice is sweet, and your
face is lovely.
15Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes
that ruin the vineyards, our vineyards
that are in bloom.
16My lover is mine and I am his; he
browses among the lilies.
17Until the day breaks and the shadows
flee, turn, my lover, and be like a gazelle
or like a young stag on the rugged hills.
3All night long on my bed I looked for
the one my heart loves; I looked for him
but did not find him.
2I will get up now and go about the city,
through its streets and squares; I will
search for the one my heart loves. So I
looked for him but did not find him.
3The watchmen found me as they made
their rounds in the city. "Have you seen
the one my heart loves?"
4Scarcely had I passed them when I
found the one my heart loves. I held him
and would not let him go till I had
brought him to my mother's house, to
the room of the one who conceived me.
5Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you
by the gazelles and by the does of the
field: Do not arouse or awaken love until
it so desires.
6Who is this coming up from the desert
like a column of smoke, perfumed with
myrrh and incense made from all the
spices of the merchant?
7Look! It is Solomon's carriage, escorted
by sixty warriors, the noblest of Israel,
8all of them wearing the sword, all
experienced in battle, each with his
sword at his side, prepared for the
terrors of the night.
9King Solomon made for himself the
carriage; he made it of wood from
Lebanon.
10Its posts he made of silver, its base of
gold. Its seat was upholstered with
purple, its interior lovingly inlaid by the
daughters of Jerusalem.
11Come out, you daughters of Zion, and
look at King Solomon wearing the crown,
the crown with which his mother
crowned him on the day of his wedding,
the day his heart rejoiced.
4How beautiful you are, my darling!
Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes behind
your veil are doves. Your hair is like a
flock of goats descending from Mount
Gilead.
2Your teeth are like a flock of sheep just
shorn, coming up from the washing.
Each has its twin; not one of them is
alone.
3Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon; your
mouth is lovely. Your temples behind
your veil are like the halves of a
pomegranate.
4Your neck is like the tower of David,
built with elegance ; on it hang a
thousand shields, all of them shields of
warriors.
5Your two breasts are like two fawns,
like twin fawns of a gazelle that browse
among the lilies.
6Until the day breaks and the shadows
flee, I will go to the mountain of myrrh
and to the hill of incense.
7All beautiful you are, my darling; there
is no flaw in you.
8Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,
come with me from Lebanon. Descend
from the crest of Amana, from the top of
Senir, the summit of Hermon, from the
lions' dens and the mountain haunts of
the leopards.
9You have stolen my heart, my sister,
my bride; you have stolen my heart with
one glance of your eyes, with one jewel
of your necklace.
10How delightful is your love, my sister,
my bride! How much more pleasing is
your love than wine, and the fragrance
of your perfume than any spice!
11Your lips drop sweetness as the
honeycomb, my bride; milk and honey
are under your tongue. The fragrance of
your garments is like that of Lebanon.
12You are a garden locked up, my sister,
my bride; you are a spring enclosed, a
sealed fountain.
13Your plants are an orchard of
pomegranates with choice fruits, with
henna and nard,
14nard and saffron, calamus and
cinnamon, with every kind of incense
tree, with myrrh and aloes and all the
finest spices.
15You are a garden fountain, a well of
flowing water streaming down from
Lebanon.
16Awake, north wind, and come, south
wind! Blow on my garden, that its
fragrance may spread abroad. Let my
lover come into his garden and taste its
choice fruits.
5I have come into my garden, my
sister, my bride; I have gathered my
myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my
honeycomb and my honey; I have drunk
my wine and my milk. Eat, O friends,
and drink; drink your fill, O lovers.
2I slept but my heart was awake. Listen!
My lover is knocking: "Open to me, my
sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless
one. My head is drenched with dew, my
hair with the dampness of the night."
3I have taken off my robe- must I put it
on again? I have washed my feet- must
I soil them again?
4My lover thrust his hand through the
latch-opening; my heart began to pound
for him.
5I arose to open for my lover, and my
hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers
with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the
lock.
6I opened for my lover, but my lover had
left; he was gone. My heart sank at his
departure. I looked for him but did not
find him. I called him but he did not
answer.
7The watchmen found me as they made
their rounds in the city. They beat me,
they bruised me; they took away my
cloak, those watchmen of the walls!
8O daughters of Jerusalem, I charge
you- if you find my lover, what will you
tell him? Tell him I am faint with love.
9How is your beloved better than others,
most beautiful of women? How is your
beloved better than others, that you
charge us so?
10My lover is radiant and ruddy,
outstanding among ten thousand.
11His head is purest gold; his hair is
wavy and black as a raven.
12His eyes are like doves by the water
streams, washed in milk, mounted like
jewels.
13His cheeks are like beds of spice
yielding perfume. His lips are like lilies
dripping with myrrh.
14His arms are rods of gold set with
chrysolite. His body is like polished ivory
decorated with sapphires.
15His legs are pillars of marble set on
bases of pure gold. His appearance is
like Lebanon, choice as its cedars.
16His mouth is sweetness itself; he is
altogether lovely. This is my lover, this
my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
6Where has your lover gone, most
beautiful of women? Which way did your
lover turn, that we may look for him with
you?
2My lover has gone down to his garden,
to the beds of spices, to browse in the
gardens and to gather lilies.
3I am my lover's and my lover is mine;
he browses among the lilies.
4You are beautiful, my darling, as Tirzah,
lovely as Jerusalem, majestic as troops
with banners.
5Turn your eyes from me; they
overwhelm me. Your hair is like a flock
of goats descending from Gilead.
6Your teeth are like a flock of sheep
coming up from the washing. Each has
its twin, not one of them is alone.
7Your temples behind your veil are like
the halves of a pomegranate.
8Sixty queens there may be, and eighty
concubines, and virgins beyond number;
9but my dove, my perfect one, is unique,
the only daughter of her mother, the
favorite of the one who bore her. The
maidens saw her and called her
blessed; the queens and concubines
praised her.
10Who is this that appears like the dawn,
fair as the moon, bright as the sun,
majestic as the stars in procession?
11I went down to the grove of nut trees
to look at the new growth in the valley,
to see if the vines had budded or the
pomegranates were in bloom.
12Before I realized it, my desire set me
among the royal chariots of my people.
13Come back, come back, O
Shulammite; come back, come back,
that we may gaze on you! Why would
you gaze on the Shulammite as on the
dance of Mahanaim?
7How beautiful your sandaled feet, O
prince's daughter! Your graceful legs are
like jewels, the work of a craftsman's
hands.
2Your navel is a rounded goblet that
never lacks blended wine. Your waist is
a mound of wheat encircled by lilies.
3Your breasts are like two fawns, twins
of a gazelle.
4Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your
eyes are the pools of Heshbon by the
gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose is like
the tower of Lebanon looking toward
Damascus.
5Your head crowns you like Mount
Carmel. Your hair is like royal tapestry;
the king is held captive by its tresses.
6How beautiful you are and how
pleasing, O love, with your delights!
7Your stature is like that of the palm, and
your breasts like clusters of fruit.
8I said, "I will climb the palm tree; I will
take hold of its fruit." May your breasts
be like the clusters of the vine, the
fragrance of your breath like apples,
9and your mouth like the best wine. May
the wine go straight to my lover, flowing
gently over lips and teeth.
10I belong to my lover, and his desire is
for me.
11Come, my lover, let us go to the
countryside, let us spend the night in the
villages.
12Let us go early to the vineyards to see
if the vines have budded, if their
blossoms have opened, and if the
pomegranates are in bloom- there I will
give you my love.
13The mandrakes send out their
fragrance, and at our door is every
delicacy, both new and old, that I have
stored up for you, my lover.
8If only you were to me like a brother,
who was nursed at my mother's breasts!
Then, if I found you outside, I would kiss
you, and no one would despise me.
2I would lead you and bring you to my
mother's house- she who has taught me.
I would give you spiced wine to drink,
the nectar of my pomegranates.
3His left arm is under my head and his
right arm embraces me.
4Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you:
Do not arouse or awaken love until it so
desires.
5Who is this coming up from the desert
leaning on her lover? Under the apple
tree I roused you; there your mother
conceived you, there she who was in
labor gave you birth.
6Place me like a seal over your heart,
like a seal on your arm; for love is as
strong as death, its jealousy unyielding
as the grave. It burns like blazing fire,
like a mighty flame.
7Many waters cannot quench love; rivers
cannot wash it away. If one were to give
all the wealth of his house for love, it
would be utterly scorned.
8We have a young sister, and her
breasts are not yet grown. What shall
we do for our sister for the day she is
spoken for?
9If she is a wall, we will build towers of
silver on her. If she is a door, we will
enclose her with panels of cedar.
10I am a wall, and my breasts are like
towers. Thus I have become in his eyes
like one bringing contentment.
11Solomon had a vineyard in Baal
Hamon; he let out his vineyard to
tenants. Each was to bring for its fruit a
thousand shekels of silver.
12But my own vineyard is mine to give;
the thousand shekels are for you, O
Solomon, and two hundred are for those
who tend its fruit.
13You who dwell in the gardens with
friends in attendance, let me hear your
voice!
14Come away, my lover, and be like a
gazelle or like a young stag on the
spice-laden mountains.
Isaiah
1The vision concerning Judah and
Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw
during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham,
Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
2Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For
the Lord has spoken: "I reared children
and brought them up, but they have
rebelled against me.
3The ox knows his master, the donkey
his owner's manger, but Israel does not
know, my people do not understand."
4Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with
guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given
to corruption! They have forsaken the
Lord ; they have spurned the Holy One
of Israel and turned their backs on him.
5Why should you be beaten anymore?
Why do you persist in rebellion? Your
whole head is injured, your whole heart
afflicted.
6From the sole of your foot to the top of
your head there is no soundness- only
wounds and welts and open sores, not
cleansed or bandaged or soothed with
oil.
7Your country is desolate, your cities
burned with fire; your fields are being
stripped by foreigners right before you,
laid waste as when overthrown by
strangers.
8The Daughter of Zion is left like a
shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field
of melons, like a city under siege.
9Unless the Lord Almighty had left us
some survivors, we would have become
like Sodom, we would have been like
Gomorrah.
10Hear the word of the Lord , you rulers
of Sodom; listen to the law of our God,
you people of Gomorrah!
11"The multitude of your sacrifices- what
are they to me?" says the Lord . "I have
more than enough of burnt offerings, of
rams and the fat of fattened animals; I
have no pleasure in the blood of bulls
and lambs and goats.
12When you come to appear before me,
who has asked this of you, this
trampling of my courts?
13Stop bringing meaningless offerings!
Your incense is detestable to me. New
Moons, Sabbaths and convocations- I
cannot bear your evil assemblies.
14Your New Moon festivals and your
appointed feasts my soul hates. They
have become a burden to me; I am
weary of bearing them.
15When you spread out your hands in
prayer, I will hide my eyes from you;
even if you offer many prayers, I will not
listen. Your hands are full of blood;
16wash and make yourselves clean.
Take your evil deeds out of my sight!
Stop doing wrong,
17learn to do right! Seek justice,
encourage the oppressed. Defend the
cause of the fatherless, plead the case
of the widow.
18"Come now, let us reason together,"
says the Lord . "Though your sins are
like scarlet, they shall be as white as
snow; though they are red as crimson,
they shall be like wool.
19If you are willing and obedient, you will
eat the best from the land;
20but if you resist and rebel, you will be
devoured by the sword." For the mouth
of the Lord has spoken.
21See how the faithful city has become a
harlot! She once was full of justice;
righteousness used to dwell in her- but
now murderers!
22Your silver has become dross, your
choice wine is diluted with water.
23Your rulers are rebels, companions of
thieves; they all love bribes and chase
after gifts. They do not defend the cause
of the fatherless; the widow's case does
not come before them.
24Therefore the Lord, the Lord Almighty,
the Mighty One of Israel, declares: "Ah, I
will get relief from my foes and avenge
myself on my enemies.
25I will turn my hand against you; I will
thoroughly purge away your dross and
remove all your impurities.
26I will restore your judges as in days of
old, your counselors as at the beginning.
Afterward you will be called the City of
Righteousness, the Faithful City."
27Zion will be redeemed with justice, her
penitent ones with righteousness.
28But rebels and sinners will both be
broken, and those who forsake the Lord
will perish.
29"You will be ashamed because of the
sacred oaks in which you have
delighted; you will be disgraced because
of the gardens that you have chosen.
30You will be like an oak with fading
leaves, like a garden without water.
31The mighty man will become tinder
and his work a spark; both will burn
together, with no one to quench the fire."
2This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw
concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
2In the last days the mountain of the
Lord 's temple will be established as
chief among the mountains; it will be
raised above the hills, and all nations
will stream to it.
3Many peoples will come and say,
"Come, let us go up to the mountain of
the Lord , to the house of the God of
Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that
we may walk in his paths." The law will
go out from Zion, the word of the Lord
from Jerusalem.
4He will judge between the nations and
will settle disputes for many peoples.
They will beat their swords into
plowshares and their spears into
pruning hooks. Nation will not take up
sword against nation, nor will they train
for war anymore.
5Come, O house of Jacob, let us walk in
the light of the Lord . The Day of the
Lord
6You have abandoned your people, the
house of Jacob. They are full of
superstitions from the East; they
practice divination like the Philistines
and clasp hands with pagans.
7Their land is full of silver and gold;
there is no end to their treasures. Their
land is full of horses; there is no end to
their chariots.
8Their land is full of idols; they bow
down to the work of their hands, to what
their fingers have made.
9So man will be brought low and
mankind humbled- do not forgive them.
10Go into the rocks, hide in the ground
from dread of the Lord and the splendor
of his majesty!
11The eyes of the arrogant man will be
humbled and the pride of men brought
low; the Lord alone will be exalted in
that day.
12The Lord Almighty has a day in store
for all the proud and lofty, for all that is
exalted (and they will be humbled),
13for all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and
lofty, and all the oaks of Bashan,
14for all the towering mountains and all
the high hills,
15for every lofty tower and every fortified
wall,
16for every trading ship and every stately
vessel.
17The arrogance of man will be brought
low and the pride of men humbled; the
Lord alone will be exalted in that day,
18and the idols will totally disappear.
19Men will flee to caves in the rocks and
to holes in the ground from dread of the
Lord and the splendor of his majesty,
when he rises to shake the earth.
20In that day men will throw away to the
rodents and bats their idols of silver and
idols of gold, which they made to
worship.
21They will flee to caverns in the rocks
and to the overhanging crags from
dread of the Lord and the splendor of
his majesty, when he rises to shake the
earth.
22Stop trusting in man, who has but a
breath in his nostrils. Of what account is
he?
3See now, the Lord, the Lord Almighty,
is about to take from Jerusalem and
Judah both supply and support: all
supplies of food and all supplies of
water,
2the hero and warrior, the judge and
prophet, the soothsayer and elder,
3the captain of fifty and man of rank, the
counselor, skilled craftsman and clever
enchanter.
4I will make boys their officials; mere
children will govern them.
5People will oppress each other- man
against man, neighbor against neighbor.
The young will rise up against the old,
the base against the honorable.
6A man will seize one of his brothers at
his father's home, and say, "You have a
cloak, you be our leader; take charge of
this heap of ruins!"
7But in that day he will cry out, "I have
no remedy. I have no food or clothing in
my house; do not make me the leader of
the people."
8Jerusalem staggers, Judah is falling;
their words and deeds are against the
Lord , defying his glorious presence.
9The look on their faces testifies against
them; they parade their sin like Sodom;
they do not hide it. Woe to them! They
have brought disaster upon themselves.
10Tell the righteous it will be well with
them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their
deeds.
11Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon
them! They will be paid back for what
their hands have done.
12Youths oppress my people, women
rule over them. O my people, your
guides lead you astray; they turn you
from the path.
13The Lord takes his place in court; he
rises to judge the people.
14The Lord enters into judgment against
the elders and leaders of his people: "It
is you who have ruined my vineyard; the
plunder from the poor is in your houses.
15What do you mean by crushing my
people and grinding the faces of the
poor?" declares the Lord, the Lord
Almighty.
16The Lord says, "The women of Zion
are haughty, walking along with
outstretched necks, flirting with their
eyes, tripping along with mincing steps,
with ornaments jingling on their ankles.
17Therefore the Lord will bring sores on
the heads of the women of Zion; the
Lord will make their scalps bald."
18In that day the Lord will snatch away
their finery: the bangles and headbands
and crescent necklaces,
19the earrings and bracelets and veils,
20the headdresses and ankle chains and
sashes, the perfume bottles and charms,
21the signet rings and nose rings,
22the fine robes and the capes and
cloaks, the purses
23and mirrors, and the linen garments
and tiaras and shawls.
24Instead of fragrance there will be a
stench; instead of a sash, a rope;
instead of well-dressed hair, baldness;
instead of fine clothing, sackcloth;
instead of beauty, branding.
25Your men will fall by the sword, your
warriors in battle.
26The gates of Zion will lament and
mourn; destitute, she will sit on the
ground.
4In that day seven women will take
hold of one man and say, "We will eat
our own food and provide our own
clothes; only let us be called by your
name. Take away our disgrace!"
2In that day the Branch of the Lord will
be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of
the land will be the pride and glory of the
survivors in Israel.
3Those who are left in Zion, who remain
in Jerusalem, will be called holy, all who
are recorded among the living in
Jerusalem.
4The Lord will wash away the filth of the
women of Zion; he will cleanse the
bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit of
judgment and a spirit of fire.
5Then the Lord will create over all of
Mount Zion and over those who
assemble there a cloud of smoke by day
and a glow of flaming fire by night; over
all the glory will be a canopy.
6It will be a shelter and shade from the
heat of the day, and a refuge and hiding
place from the storm and rain.
5I will sing for the one I love a song
about his vineyard: My loved one had a
vineyard on a fertile hillside.
2He dug it up and cleared it of stones
and planted it with the choicest vines.
He built a watchtower in it and cut out a
winepress as well. Then he looked for a
crop of good grapes, but it yielded only
bad fruit.
3"Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and
men of Judah, judge between me and
my vineyard.
4What more could have been done for
my vineyard than I have done for it?
When I looked for good grapes, why did
it yield only bad?
5Now I will tell you what I am going to do
to my vineyard: I will take away its
hedge, and it will be destroyed; I will
break down its wall, and it will be
trampled.
6I will make it a wasteland, neither
pruned nor cultivated, and briers and
thorns will grow there. I will command
the clouds not to rain on it."
7The vineyard of the Lord Almighty is the
house of Israel, and the men of Judah
are the garden of his delight. And he
looked for justice, but saw bloodshed;
for righteousness, but heard cries of
distress.
8Woe to you who add house to house
and join field to field till no space is left
and you live alone in the land.
9The Lord Almighty has declared in my
hearing: "Surely the great houses will
become desolate, the fine mansions left
without occupants.
10A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a
bath of wine, a homer of seed only an
ephah of grain."
11Woe to those who rise early in the
morning to run after their drinks, who
stay up late at night till they are inflamed
with wine.
12They have harps and lyres at their
banquets, tambourines and flutes and
wine, but they have no regard for the
deeds of the Lord , no respect for the
work of his hands.
13Therefore my people will go into exile
for lack of understanding; their men of
rank will die of hunger and their masses
will be parched with thirst.
14Therefore the grave enlarges its
appetite and opens its mouth without
limit; into it will descend their nobles and
masses with all their brawlers and
revelers.
15So man will be brought low and
mankind humbled, the eyes of the
arrogant humbled.
16But the Lord Almighty will be exalted
by his justice, and the holy God will
show himself holy by his righteousness.
17Then sheep will graze as in their own
pasture; lambs will feed among the ruins
of the rich.
18Woe to those who draw sin along with
cords of deceit, and wickedness as with
cart ropes,
19to those who say, "Let God hurry, let
him hasten his work so we may see it.
Let it approach, let the plan of the Holy
One of Israel come, so we may know it."
20Woe to those who call evil good and
good evil, who put darkness for light and
light for darkness, who put bitter for
sweet and sweet for bitter.
21Woe to those who are wise in their
own eyes and clever in their own sight.
22Woe to those who are heroes at
drinking wine and champions at mixing
drinks,
23who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but
deny justice to the innocent.
24Therefore, as tongues of fire lick up
straw and as dry grass sinks down in
the flames, so their roots will decay and
their flowers blow away like dust; for
they have rejected the law of the Lord
Almighty and spurned the word of the
Holy One of Israel.
25Therefore the Lord 's anger burns
against his people; his hand is raised
and he strikes them down. The
mountains shake, and the dead bodies
are like refuse in the streets. Yet for all
this, his anger is not turned away, his
hand is still upraised.
26He lifts up a banner for the distant
nations, he whistles for those at the
ends of the earth. Here they come,
swiftly and speedily!
27Not one of them grows tired or
stumbles, not one slumbers or sleeps;
not a belt is loosened at the waist, not a
sandal thong is broken.
28Their arrows are sharp, all their bows
are strung; their horses' hoofs seem like
flint, their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.
29Their roar is like that of the lion, they
roar like young lions; they growl as they
seize their prey and carry it off with no
one to rescue.
30In that day they will roar over it like the
roaring of the sea. And if one looks at
the land, he will see darkness and
distress; even the light will be darkened
by the clouds.
6In the year that King Uzziah died, I
saw the Lord seated on a throne, high
and exalted, and the train of his robe
filled the temple.
2Above him were seraphs, each with six
wings: With two wings they covered
their faces, with two they covered their
feet, and with two they were flying.
3And they were calling to one another:
"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty;
the whole earth is full of his glory."
4At the sound of their voices the
doorposts and thresholds shook and the
temple was filled with smoke.
5"Woe to me!" I cried. "I am ruined! For I
am a man of unclean lips, and I live
among a people of unclean lips, and my
eyes have seen the King, the Lord
Almighty."
6Then one of the seraphs flew to me
with a live coal in his hand, which he
had taken with tongs from the altar.
7With it he touched my mouth and said,
"See, this has touched your lips; your
guilt is taken away and your sin atoned
for."
8Then I heard the voice of the Lord
saying, "Whom shall I send? And who
will go for us?" And I said, "Here am I.
Send me!"
9He said, "Go and tell this people: " 'Be
ever hearing, but never understanding;
be ever seeing, but never perceiving.'
10Make the heart of this people
calloused; make their ears dull and
close their eyes. Otherwise they might
see with their eyes, hear with their ears,
understand with their hearts, and turn
and be healed."
11Then I said, "For how long, O Lord?"
And he answered: "Until the cities lie
ruined and without inhabitant, until the
houses are left deserted and the fields
ruined and ravaged,
12until the Lord has sent everyone far
away and the land is utterly forsaken.
13And though a tenth remains in the land,
it will again be laid waste. But as the
terebinth and oak leave stumps when
they are cut down, so the holy seed will
be the stump in the land."
7When Ahaz son of Jotham, the son
of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King
Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of
Remaliah king of Israel marched up to
fight against Jerusalem, but they could
not overpower it.
2Now the house of David was told,
"Aram has allied itself with Ephraim"; so
the hearts of Ahaz and his people were
shaken, as the trees of the forest are
shaken by the wind.
3Then the Lord said to Isaiah, "Go out,
you and your son Shear-Jashub, to
meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct of
the Upper Pool, on the road to the
Washerman's Field.
4Say to him, 'Be careful, keep calm and
don't be afraid. Do not lose heart
because of these two smoldering stubs
of firewood-because of the fierce anger
of Rezin and Aram and of the son of
Remaliah.
5Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah's son
have plotted your ruin, saying,
6"Let us invade Judah; let us tear it apart
and divide it among ourselves, and
make the son of Tabeel king over it."
7Yet this is what the Sovereign Lord
says: " 'It will not take place, it will not
happen,
8for the head of Aram is Damascus, and
the head of Damascus is only Rezin.
Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be
too shattered to be a people.
9The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and
the head of Samaria is only Remaliah's
son. If you do not stand firm in your faith,
you will not stand at all.' "
10Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz,
11"Ask the Lord your God for a sign,
whether in the deepest depths or in the
highest heights."
12But Ahaz said, "I will not ask; I will not
put the Lord to the test."
13Then Isaiah said, "Hear now, you
house of David! Is it not enough to try
the patience of men? Will you try the
patience of my God also?
14Therefore the Lord himself will give
you a sign: The virgin will be with child
and will give birth to a son, and will call
him Immanuel.
15He will eat curds and honey when he
knows enough to reject the wrong and
choose the right.
16But before the boy knows enough to
reject the wrong and choose the right,
the land of the two kings you dread will
be laid waste.
17The Lord will bring on you and on your
people and on the house of your father
a time unlike any since Ephraim broke
away from Judah-he will bring the king
of Assyria."
18In that day the Lord will whistle for flies
from the distant streams of Egypt and
for bees from the land of Assyria.
19They will all come and settle in the
steep ravines and in the crevices in the
rocks, on all the thornbushes and at all
the water holes.
20In that day the Lord will use a razor
hired from beyond the River -the king of
Assyria-to shave your head and the hair
of your legs, and to take off your beards
also.
21In that day, a man will keep alive a
young cow and two goats.
22And because of the abundance of the
milk they give, he will have curds to eat.
All who remain in the land will eat curds
and honey.
23In that day, in every place where there
were a thousand vines worth a thousand
silver shekels, there will be only briers
and thorns.
24Men will go there with bow and arrow,
for the land will be covered with briers
and thorns.
25As for all the hills once cultivated by
the hoe, you will no longer go there for
fear of the briers and thorns; they will
become places where cattle are turned
loose and where sheep run.
8The Lord said to me, "Take a large
scroll and write on it with an ordinary
pen: Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.
2And I will call in Uriah the priest and
Zechariah son of Jeberekiah as reliable
witnesses for me."
3Then I went to the prophetess, and she
conceived and gave birth to a son. And
the Lord said to me, "Name him Maher-
Shalal-Hash-Baz.
4Before the boy knows how to say 'My
father' or 'My mother,' the wealth of
Damascus and the plunder of Samaria
will be carried off by the king of Assyria."
5The Lord spoke to me again:
6"Because this people has rejected the
gently flowing waters of Shiloah and
rejoices over Rezin and the son of
Remaliah,
7therefore the Lord is about to bring
against them the mighty floodwaters of
the River - the king of Assyria with all his
pomp. It will overflow all its channels,
run over all its banks
8and sweep on into Judah, swirling over
it, passing through it and reaching up to
the neck. Its outspread wings will cover
the breadth of your land, O Immanuel !"
9Raise the war cry, you nations, and be
shattered! Listen, all you distant lands.
Prepare for battle, and be shattered!
Prepare for battle, and be shattered!
10Devise your strategy, but it will be
thwarted; propose your plan, but it will
not stand, for God is with us.
11The Lord spoke to me with his strong
hand upon me, warning me not to follow
the way of this people. He said:
12"Do not call conspiracy everything that
these people call conspiracy ; do not
fear what they fear, and do not dread it.
13The Lord Almighty is the one you are
to regard as holy, he is the one you are
to fear, he is the one you are to dread,
14and he will be a sanctuary; but for both
houses of Israel he will be a stone that
causes men to stumble and a rock that
makes them fall. And for the people of
Jerusalem he will be a trap and a snare.
15Many of them will stumble; they will fall
and be broken, they will be snared and
captured."
16Bind up the testimony and seal up the
law among my disciples.
17I will wait for the Lord , who is hiding
his face from the house of Jacob. I will
put my trust in him.
18Here am I, and the children the Lord
has given me. We are signs and
symbols in Israel from the Lord Almighty,
who dwells on Mount Zion.
19When men tell you to consult mediums
and spiritists, who whisper and mutter,
should not a people inquire of their
God? Why consult the dead on behalf of
the living?
20To the law and to the testimony! If they
do not speak according to this word,
they have no light of dawn.
21Distressed and hungry, they will roam
through the land; when they are
famished, they will become enraged and,
looking upward, will curse their king and
their God.
22Then they will look toward the earth
and see only distress and darkness and
fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into
utter darkness.
9Nevertheless, there will be no more
gloom for those who were in distress. In
the past he humbled the land of Zebulun
and the land of Naphtali, but in the
future he will honor Galilee of the
Gentiles, by the way of the sea, along
the Jordan-
2The people walking in darkness have
seen a great light; on those living in the
land of the shadow of death a light has
dawned.
3You have enlarged the nation and
increased their joy; they rejoice before
you as people rejoice at the harvest, as
men rejoice when dividing the plunder.
4For as in the day of Midian's defeat,
you have shattered the yoke that
burdens them, the bar across their
shoulders, the rod of their oppressor.
5Every warrior's boot used in battle and
every garment rolled in blood will be
destined for burning, will be fuel for the
fire.
6For to us a child is born, to us a son is
given, and the government will be on his
shoulders. And he will be called
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
7Of the increase of his government and
peace there will be no end. He will reign
on David's throne and over his kingdom,
establishing and upholding it with justice
and righteousness from that time on and
forever. The zeal of the Lord Almighty
will accomplish this.
8The Lord has sent a message against
Jacob; it will fall on Israel.
9All the people will know it- Ephraim and
the inhabitants of Samaria- who say with
pride and arrogance of heart,
10"The bricks have fallen down, but we
will rebuild with dressed stone; the fig
trees have been felled, but we will
replace them with cedars."
11But the Lord has strengthened Rezin's
foes against them and has spurred their
enemies on.
12Arameans from the east and
Philistines from the west have devoured
Israel with open mouth. Yet for all this,
his anger is not turned away, his hand is
still upraised.
13But the people have not returned to
him who struck them, nor have they
sought the Lord Almighty.
14So the Lord will cut off from Israel both
head and tail, both palm branch and
reed in a single day;
15the elders and prominent men are the
head, the prophets who teach lies are
the tail.
16Those who guide this people mislead
them, and those who are guided are led
astray.
17Therefore the Lord will take no
pleasure in the young men, nor will he
pity the fatherless and widows, for
everyone is ungodly and wicked, every
mouth speaks vileness. Yet for all this,
his anger is not turned away, his hand is
still upraised.
18Surely wickedness burns like a fire; it
consumes briers and thorns, it sets the
forest thickets ablaze, so that it rolls
upward in a column of smoke.
19By the wrath of the Lord Almighty the
land will be scorched and the people will
be fuel for the fire; no one will spare his
brother.
20On the right they will devour, but still
be hungry; on the left they will eat, but
not be satisfied. Each will feed on the
flesh of his own offspring :
21Manasseh will feed on Ephraim, and
Ephraim on Manasseh; together they
will turn against Judah. Yet for all this,
his anger is not turned away, his hand is
still upraised.
10Woe to those who make unjust
laws, to those who issue oppressive
decrees,
2to deprive the poor of their rights and
withhold justice from the oppressed of
my people, making widows their prey
and robbing the fatherless.
3What will you do on the day of
reckoning, when disaster comes from
afar? To whom will you run for help?
Where will you leave your riches?
4Nothing will remain but to cringe among
the captives or fall among the slain. Yet
for all this, his anger is not turned away,
his hand is still upraised.
5"Woe to the Assyrian, the rod of my
anger, in whose hand is the club of my
wrath!
6I send him against a godless nation, I
dispatch him against a people who
anger me, to seize loot and snatch
plunder, and to trample them down like
mud in the streets.
7But this is not what he intends, this is
not what he has in mind; his purpose is
to destroy, to put an end to many
nations.
8'Are not my commanders all kings?' he
says.
9'Has not Calno fared like Carchemish?
Is not Hamath like Arpad, and Samaria
like Damascus?
10As my hand seized the kingdoms of
the idols, kingdoms whose images
excelled those of Jerusalem and
Samaria-
11shall I not deal with Jerusalem and her
images as I dealt with Samaria and her
idols?' "
12When the Lord has finished all his
work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem,
he will say, "I will punish the king of
Assyria for the willful pride of his heart
and the haughty look in his eyes.
13For he says: " 'By the strength of my
hand I have done this, and by my
wisdom, because I have understanding.
I removed the boundaries of nations, I
plundered their treasures; like a mighty
one I subdued their kings.
14As one reaches into a nest, so my
hand reached for the wealth of the
nations; as men gather abandoned eggs,
so I gathered all the countries; not one
flapped a wing, or opened its mouth to
chirp.' "
15Does the ax raise itself above him who
swings it, or the saw boast against him
who uses it? As if a rod were to wield
him who lifts it up, or a club brandish
him who is not wood!
16Therefore, the Lord, the Lord Almighty,
will send a wasting disease upon his
sturdy warriors; under his pomp a fire
will be kindled like a blazing flame.
17The Light of Israel will become a fire,
their Holy One a flame; in a single day it
will burn and consume his thorns and
his briers.
18The splendor of his forests and fertile
fields it will completely destroy, as when
a sick man wastes away.
19And the remaining trees of his forests
will be so few that a child could write
them down.
20In that day the remnant of Israel, the
survivors of the house of Jacob, will no
longer rely on him who struck them
down but will truly rely on the Lord , the
Holy One of Israel.
21A remnant will return, a remnant of
Jacob will return to the Mighty God.
22Though your people, O Israel, be like
the sand by the sea, only a remnant will
return. Destruction has been decreed,
overwhelming and righteous.
23The Lord, the Lord Almighty, will carry
out the destruction decreed upon the
whole land.
24Therefore, this is what the Lord, the
Lord Almighty, says: "O my people who
live in Zion, do not be afraid of the
Assyrians, who beat you with a rod and
lift up a club against you, as Egypt did.
25Very soon my anger against you will
end and my wrath will be directed to
their destruction."
26The Lord Almighty will lash them with
a whip, as when he struck down Midian
at the rock of Oreb; and he will raise his
staff over the waters, as he did in Egypt.
27In that day their burden will be lifted
from your shoulders, their yoke from
your neck; the yoke will be broken
because you have grown so fat.
28They enter Aiath; they pass through
Migron; they store supplies at Micmash.
29They go over the pass, and say, "We
will camp overnight at Geba." Ramah
trembles; Gibeah of Saul flees.
30Cry out, O Daughter of Gallim! Listen,
O Laishah! Poor Anathoth!
31Madmenah is in flight; the people of
Gebim take cover.
32This day they will halt at Nob; they will
shake their fist at the mount of the
Daughter of Zion, at the hill of
Jerusalem.
33See, the Lord, the Lord Almighty, will
lop off the boughs with great power. The
lofty trees will be felled, the tall ones will
be brought low.
34He will cut down the forest thickets
with an ax; Lebanon will fall before the
Mighty One.
11A shoot will come up from the
stump of Jesse; from his roots a Branch
will bear fruit.
2The Spirit of the Lord will rest on himthe
Spirit of wisdom and of
understanding, the Spirit of counsel and
of power, the Spirit of knowledge and of
the fear of the Lord -
3and he will delight in the fear of the
Lord . He will not judge by what he sees
with his eyes, or decide by what he
hears with his ears;
4but with righteousness he will judge the
needy, with justice he will give decisions
for the poor of the earth. He will strike
the earth with the rod of his mouth; with
the breath of his lips he will slay the
wicked.
5Righteousness will be his belt and
faithfulness the sash around his waist.
6The wolf will live with the lamb, the
leopard will lie down with the goat, the
calf and the lion and the yearling
together; and a little child will lead them.
7The cow will feed with the bear, their
young will lie down together, and the
lion will eat straw like the ox.
8The infant will play near the hole of the
cobra, and the young child put his hand
into the viper's nest.
9They will neither harm nor destroy on
all my holy mountain, for the earth will
be full of the knowledge of the Lord as
the waters cover the sea.
10In that day the Root of Jesse will stand
as a banner for the peoples; the nations
will rally to him, and his place of rest will
be glorious.
11In that day the Lord will reach out his
hand a second time to reclaim the
remnant that is left of his people from
Assyria, from Lower Egypt, from Upper
Egypt, from Cush, from Elam, from
Babylonia, from Hamath and from the
islands of the sea.
12He will raise a banner for the nations
and gather the exiles of Israel; he will
assemble the scattered people of Judah
from the four quarters of the earth.
13Ephraim's jealousy will vanish, and
Judah's enemies will be cut off; Ephraim
will not be jealous of Judah, nor Judah
hostile toward Ephraim.
14They will swoop down on the slopes of
Philistia to the west; together they will
plunder the people to the east. They will
lay hands on Edom and Moab, and the
Ammonites will be subject to them.
15The Lord will dry up the gulf of the
Egyptian sea; with a scorching wind he
will sweep his hand over the Euphrates
River. He will break it up into seven
streams so that men can cross over in
sandals.
16There will be a highway for the
remnant of his people that is left from
Assyria, as there was for Israel when
they came up from Egypt.
12In that day you will say: "I will
praise you, O Lord . Although you were
angry with me, your anger has turned
away and you have comforted me.
2Surely God is my salvation; I will trust
and not be afraid. The Lord , the Lord ,
is my strength and my song; he has
become my salvation."
3With joy you will draw water from the
wells of salvation.
4In that day you will say: "Give thanks to
the Lord , call on his name; make known
among the nations what he has done,
and proclaim that his name is exalted.
5Sing to the Lord , for he has done
glorious things; let this be known to all
the world.
6Shout aloud and sing for joy, people of
Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel
among you."
13An oracle concerning Babylon that
Isaiah son of Amoz saw:
2Raise a banner on a bare hilltop, shout
to them; beckon to them to enter the
gates of the nobles.
3I have commanded my holy ones; I
have summoned my warriors to carry
out my wrath- those who rejoice in my
triumph.
4Listen, a noise on the mountains, like
that of a great multitude! Listen, an
uproar among the kingdoms, like
nations massing together! The Lord
Almighty is mustering an army for war.
5They come from faraway lands, from
the ends of the heavens- the Lord and
the weapons of his wrath- to destroy the
whole country.
6Wail, for the day of the Lord is near; it
will come like destruction from the
Almighty.
7Because of this, all hands will go limp,
every man's heart will melt.
8Terror will seize them, pain and
anguish will grip them; they will writhe
like a woman in labor. They will look
aghast at each other, their faces aflame.
9See, the day of the Lord is coming -a
cruel day, with wrath and fierce angerto
make the land desolate and destroy
the sinners within it.
10The stars of heaven and their
constellations will not show their light.
The rising sun will be darkened and the
moon will not give its light.
11I will punish the world for its evil, the
wicked for their sins. I will put an end to
the arrogance of the haughty and will
humble the pride of the ruthless.
12I will make man scarcer than pure gold,
more rare than the gold of Ophir.
13Therefore I will make the heavens
tremble; and the earth will shake from its
place at the wrath of the Lord Almighty,
in the day of his burning anger.
14Like a hunted gazelle, like sheep
without a shepherd, each will return to
his own people, each will flee to his
native land.
15Whoever is captured will be thrust
through; all who are caught will fall by
the sword.
16Their infants will be dashed to pieces
before their eyes; their houses will be
looted and their wives ravished.
17See, I will stir up against them the
Medes, who do not care for silver and
have no delight in gold.
18Their bows will strike down the young
men; they will have no mercy on infants
nor will they look with compassion on
children.
19Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms, the
glory of the Babylonians' pride, will be
overthrown by God like Sodom and
Gomorrah.
20She will never be inhabited or lived in
through all generations; no Arab will
pitch his tent there, no shepherd will rest
his flocks there.
21But desert creatures will lie there,
jackals will fill her houses; there the owls
will dwell, and there the wild goats will
leap about.
22Hyenas will howl in her strongholds,
jackals in her luxurious palaces. Her
time is at hand, and her days will not be
prolonged.
14The Lord will have compassion on
Jacob; once again he will choose Israel
and will settle them in their own land.
Aliens will join them and unite with the
house of Jacob.
2Nations will take them and bring them
to their own place. And the house of
Israel will possess the nations as
menservants and maidservants in the
Lord 's land. They will make captives of
their captors and rule over their
oppressors.
3On the day the Lord gives you relief
from suffering and turmoil and cruel
bondage,
4you will take up this taunt against the
king of Babylon: How the oppressor has
come to an end! How his fury has
ended!
5The Lord has broken the rod of the
wicked, the scepter of the rulers,
6which in anger struck down peoples
with unceasing blows, and in fury
subdued nations with relentless
aggression.
7All the lands are at rest and at peace;
they break into singing.
8Even the pine trees and the cedars of
Lebanon exult over you and say, "Now
that you have been laid low, no
woodsman comes to cut us down."
9The grave below is all astir to meet you
at your coming; it rouses the spirits of
the departed to greet you- all those who
were leaders in the world; it makes them
rise from their thrones- all those who
were kings over the nations.
10They will all respond, they will say to
you, "You also have become weak, as
we are; you have become like us."
11All your pomp has been brought down
to the grave, along with the noise of
your harps; maggots are spread out
beneath you and worms cover you.
12How you have fallen from heaven, O
morning star, son of the dawn! You have
been cast down to the earth, you who
once laid low the nations!
13You said in your heart, "I will ascend to
heaven; I will raise my throne above the
stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the
mount of assembly, on the utmost
heights of the sacred mountain.
14I will ascend above the tops of the
clouds; I will make myself like the Most
High."
15But you are brought down to the grave,
to the depths of the pit.
16Those who see you stare at you, they
ponder your fate: "Is this the man who
shook the earth and made kingdoms
tremble,
17the man who made the world a desert,
who overthrew its cities and would not
let his captives go home?"
18All the kings of the nations lie in state,
each in his own tomb.
19But you are cast out of your tomb like
a rejected branch; you are covered with
the slain, with those pierced by the
sword, those who descend to the stones
of the pit. Like a corpse trampled
underfoot,
20you will not join them in burial, for you
have destroyed your land and killed your
people. The offspring of the wicked will
never be mentioned again.
21Prepare a place to slaughter his sons
for the sins of their forefathers; they are
not to rise to inherit the land and cover
the earth with their cities.
22"I will rise up against them," declares
the Lord Almighty. "I will cut off from
Babylon her name and survivors, her
offspring and descendants," declares
the Lord .
23"I will turn her into a place for owls and
into swampland; I will sweep her with
the broom of destruction," declares the
Lord Almighty.
24The Lord Almighty has sworn, "Surely,
as I have planned, so it will be, and as I
have purposed, so it will stand.
25I will crush the Assyrian in my land; on
my mountains I will trample him down.
His yoke will be taken from my people,
and his burden removed from their
shoulders."
26This is the plan determined for the
whole world; this is the hand stretched
out over all nations.
27For the Lord Almighty has purposed,
and who can thwart him? His hand is
stretched out, and who can turn it back?
28This oracle came in the year King
Ahaz died:
29Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that
the rod that struck you is broken; from
the root of that snake will spring up a
viper, its fruit will be a darting,
venomous serpent.
30The poorest of the poor will find
pasture, and the needy will lie down in
safety. But your root I will destroy by
famine; it will slay your survivors.
31Wail, O gate! Howl, O city! Melt away,
all you Philistines! A cloud of smoke
comes from the north, and there is not a
straggler in its ranks.
32What answer shall be given to the
envoys of that nation? "The Lord has
established Zion, and in her his afflicted
people will find refuge."
15An oracle concerning Moab: Ar in
Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! Kir
in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night!
2Dibon goes up to its temple, to its high
places to weep; Moab wails over Nebo
and Medeba. Every head is shaved and
every beard cut off.
3In the streets they wear sackcloth; on
the roofs and in the public squares they
all wail, prostrate with weeping.
4Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their
voices are heard all the way to Jahaz.
Therefore the armed men of Moab cry
out, and their hearts are faint.
5My heart cries out over Moab; her
fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as
Eglath Shelishiyah. They go up the way
to Luhith, weeping as they go; on the
road to Horonaim they lament their
destruction.
6The waters of Nimrim are dried up and
the grass is withered; the vegetation is
gone and nothing green is left.
7So the wealth they have acquired and
stored up they carry away over the
Ravine of the Poplars.
8Their outcry echoes along the border of
Moab; their wailing reaches as far as
Eglaim, their lamentation as far as Beer
Elim.
9Dimon's waters are full of blood, but I
will bring still more upon Dimon - a lion
upon the fugitives of Moab and upon
those who remain in the land.
16Send lambs as tribute to the ruler
of the land, from Sela, across the desert,
to the mount of the Daughter of Zion.
2Like fluttering birds pushed from the
nest, so are the women of Moab at the
fords of the Arnon.
3"Give us counsel, render a decision.
Make your shadow like night- at high
noon. Hide the fugitives, do not betray
the refugees.
4Let the Moabite fugitives stay with you;
be their shelter from the destroyer." The
oppressor will come to an end, and
destruction will cease; the aggressor will
vanish from the land.
5In love a throne will be established; in
faithfulness a man will sit on it- one from
the house of David- one who in judging
seeks justice and speeds the cause of
righteousness.
6We have heard of Moab's pride- her
overweening pride and conceit, her
pride and her insolence- but her boasts
are empty.
7Therefore the Moabites wail, they wail
together for Moab. Lament and grieve
for the men of Kir Hareseth.
8The fields of Heshbon wither, the vines
of Sibmah also. The rulers of the nations
have trampled down the choicest vines,
which once reached Jazer and spread
toward the desert. Their shoots spread
out and went as far as the sea.
9So I weep, as Jazer weeps, for the
vines of Sibmah. O Heshbon, O Elealeh,
I drench you with tears! The shouts of
joy over your ripened fruit and over your
harvests have been stilled.
10Joy and gladness are taken away from
the orchards; no one sings or shouts in
the vineyards; no one treads out wine at
the presses, for I have put an end to the
shouting.
11My heart laments for Moab like a harp,
my inmost being for Kir Hareseth.
12When Moab appears at her high place,
she only wears herself out; when she
goes to her shrine to pray, it is to no
avail.
13This is the word the Lord has already
spoken concerning Moab.
14But now the Lord says: "Within three
years, as a servant bound by contract
would count them, Moab's splendor and
all her many people will be despised,
and her survivors will be very few and
feeble."
17An oracle concerning Damascus:
"See, Damascus will no longer be a city
but will become a heap of ruins.
2The cities of Aroer will be deserted and
left to flocks, which will lie down, with no
one to make them afraid.
3The fortified city will disappear from
Ephraim, and royal power from
Damascus; the remnant of Aram will be
like the glory of the Israelites," declares
the Lord Almighty.
4"In that day the glory of Jacob will fade;
the fat of his body will waste away.
5It will be as when a reaper gathers the
standing grain and harvests the grain
with his arm- as when a man gleans
heads of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.
6Yet some gleanings will remain, as
when an olive tree is beaten, leaving
two or three olives on the topmost
branches, four or five on the fruitful
boughs," declares the Lord , the God of
Israel.
7In that day men will look to their Maker
and turn their eyes to the Holy One of
Israel.
8They will not look to the altars, the work
of their hands, and they will have no
regard for the Asherah poles and the
incense altars their fingers have made.
9In that day their strong cities, which
they left because of the Israelites, will be
like places abandoned to thickets and
undergrowth. And all will be desolation.
10You have forgotten God your Savior;
you have not remembered the Rock,
your fortress. Therefore, though you set
out the finest plants and plant imported
vines,
11though on the day you set them out,
you make them grow, and on the
morning when you plant them, you bring
them to bud, yet the harvest will be as
nothing in the day of disease and
incurable pain.
12Oh, the raging of many nations- they
rage like the raging sea! Oh, the uproar
of the peoples- they roar like the roaring
of great waters!
13Although the peoples roar like the roar
of surging waters, when he rebukes
them they flee far away, driven before
the wind like chaff on the hills, like
tumbleweed before a gale.
14In the evening, sudden terror! Before
the morning, they are gone! This is the
portion of those who loot us, the lot of
those who plunder us.
18Woe to the land of whirring wings
along the rivers of Cush,
2which sends envoys by sea in papyrus
boats over the water. Go, swift
messengers, to a people tall and
smooth-skinned, to a people feared far
and wide, an aggressive nation of
strange speech, whose land is divided
by rivers.
3All you people of the world, you who
live on the earth, when a banner is
raised on the mountains, you will see it,
and when a trumpet sounds, you will
hear it.
4This is what the Lord says to me: "I will
remain quiet and will look on from my
dwelling place, like shimmering heat in
the sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the
heat of harvest."
5For, before the harvest, when the
blossom is gone and the flower
becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off
the shoots with pruning knives, and cut
down and take away the spreading
branches.
6They will all be left to the mountain
birds of prey and to the wild animals; the
birds will feed on them all summer, the
wild animals all winter.
7At that time gifts will be brought to the
Lord Almighty from a people tall and
smooth-skinned, from a people feared
far and wide, an aggressive nation of
strange speech, whose land is divided
by rivers- the gifts will be brought to
Mount Zion, the place of the Name of
the Lord Almighty.
19An oracle concerning Egypt: See,
the Lord rides on a swift cloud and is
coming to Egypt. The idols of Egypt
tremble before him, and the hearts of
the Egyptians melt within them.
2"I will stir up Egyptian against Egyptianbrother
will fight against brother,
neighbor against neighbor, city against
city, kingdom against kingdom.
3The Egyptians will lose heart, and I will
bring their plans to nothing; they will
consult the idols and the spirits of the
dead, the mediums and the spiritists.
4I will hand the Egyptians over to the
power of a cruel master, and a fierce
king will rule over them," declares the
Lord, the Lord Almighty.
5The waters of the river will dry up, and
the riverbed will be parched and dry.
6The canals will stink; the streams of
Egypt will dwindle and dry up. The reeds
and rushes will wither,
7also the plants along the Nile, at the
mouth of the river. Every sown field
along the Nile will become parched, will
blow away and be no more.
8The fishermen will groan and lament,
all who cast hooks into the Nile; those
who throw nets on the water will pine
away.
9Those who work with combed flax will
despair, the weavers of fine linen will
lose hope.
10The workers in cloth will be dejected,
and all the wage earners will be sick at
heart.
11The officials of Zoan are nothing but
fools; the wise counselors of Pharaoh
give senseless advice. How can you say
to Pharaoh, "I am one of the wise men,
a disciple of the ancient kings"?
12Where are your wise men now? Let
them show you and make known what
the Lord Almighty has planned against
Egypt.
13The officials of Zoan have become
fools, the leaders of Memphis are
deceived; the cornerstones of her
peoples have led Egypt astray.
14The Lord has poured into them a spirit
of dizziness; they make Egypt stagger in
all that she does, as a drunkard
staggers around in his vomit.
15There is nothing Egypt can do- head
or tail, palm branch or reed.
16In that day the Egyptians will be like
women. They will shudder with fear at
the uplifted hand that the Lord Almighty
raises against them.
17And the land of Judah will bring terror
to the Egyptians; everyone to whom
Judah is mentioned will be terrified,
because of what the Lord Almighty is
planning against them.
18In that day five cities in Egypt will
speak the language of Canaan and
swear allegiance to the Lord Almighty.
One of them will be called the City of
Destruction.
19In that day there will be an altar to the
Lord in the heart of Egypt, and a
monument to the Lord at its border.
20It will be a sign and witness to the Lord
Almighty in the land of Egypt. When
they cry out to the Lord because of their
oppressors, he will send them a savior
and defender, and he will rescue them.
21So the Lord will make himself known
to the Egyptians, and in that day they
will acknowledge the Lord . They will
worship with sacrifices and grain
offerings; they will make vows to the
Lord and keep them.
22The Lord will strike Egypt with a
plague; he will strike them and heal
them. They will turn to the Lord , and he
will respond to their pleas and heal them.
23In that day there will be a highway
from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians
will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to
Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians
will worship together.
24In that day Israel will be the third,
along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing
on the earth.
25The Lord Almighty will bless them,
saying, "Blessed be Egypt my people,
Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my
inheritance."
20In the year that the supreme
commander, sent by Sargon king of
Assyria, came to Ashdod and attacked
and captured it-
2at that time the Lord spoke through
Isaiah son of Amoz. He said to him,
"Take off the sackcloth from your body
and the sandals from your feet." And he
did so, going around stripped and
barefoot.
3Then the Lord said, "Just as my servant
Isaiah has gone stripped and barefoot
for three years, as a sign and portent
against Egypt and Cush,
4so the king of Assyria will lead away
stripped and barefoot the Egyptian
captives and Cushite exiles, young and
old, with buttocks bared-to Egypt's
shame.
5Those who trusted in Cush and
boasted in Egypt will be afraid and put
to shame.
6In that day the people who live on this
coast will say, 'See what has happened
to those we relied on, those we fled to
for help and deliverance from the king of
Assyria! How then can we escape?' "
21An oracle concerning the Desert
by the Sea: Like whirlwinds sweeping
through the southland, an invader
comes from the desert, from a land of
terror.
2A dire vision has been shown to me:
The traitor betrays, the looter takes loot.
Elam, attack! Media, lay siege! I will
bring to an end all the groaning she
caused.
3At this my body is racked with pain,
pangs seize me, like those of a woman
in labor; I am staggered by what I hear, I
am bewildered by what I see.
4My heart falters, fear makes me
tremble; the twilight I longed for has
become a horror to me.
5They set the tables, they spread the
rugs, they eat, they drink! Get up, you
officers, oil the shields!
6This is what the Lord says to me: "Go,
post a lookout and have him report what
he sees.
7When he sees chariots with teams of
horses, riders on donkeys or riders on
camels, let him be alert, fully alert."
8And the lookout shouted, "Day after
day, my lord, I stand on the watchtower;
every night I stay at my post.
9Look, here comes a man in a chariot
with a team of horses. And he gives
back the answer: 'Babylon has fallen,
has fallen! All the images of its gods lie
shattered on the ground!' "
10O my people, crushed on the threshing
floor, I tell you what I have heard from
the Lord Almighty, from the God of
Israel.
11An oracle concerning Dumah :
Someone calls to me from Seir,
"Watchman, what is left of the night?
Watchman, what is left of the night?"
12The watchman replies, "Morning is
coming, but also the night. If you would
ask, then ask; and come back yet
again."
13An oracle concerning Arabia: You
caravans of Dedanites, who camp in the
thickets of Arabia,
14bring water for the thirsty; you who live
in Tema, bring food for the fugitives.
15They flee from the sword, from the
drawn sword, from the bent bow and
from the heat of battle.
16This is what the Lord says to me:
"Within one year, as a servant bound by
contract would count it, all the pomp of
Kedar will come to an end.
17The survivors of the bowmen, the
warriors of Kedar, will be few." The Lord ,
the God of Israel, has spoken.
22An oracle concerning the Valley of
Vision: What troubles you now, that you
have all gone up on the roofs,
2O town full of commotion, O city of
tumult and revelry? Your slain were not
killed by the sword, nor did they die in
battle.
3All your leaders have fled together; they
have been captured without using the
bow. All you who were caught were
taken prisoner together, having fled
while the enemy was still far away.
4Therefore I said, "Turn away from me;
let me weep bitterly. Do not try to
console me over the destruction of my
people."
5The Lord, the Lord Almighty, has a day
of tumult and trampling and terror in the
Valley of Vision, a day of battering down
walls and of crying out to the mountains.
6Elam takes up the quiver, with her
charioteers and horses; Kir uncovers the
shield.
7Your choicest valleys are full of chariots,
and horsemen are posted at the city
gates;
8the defenses of Judah are stripped
away. And you looked in that day to the
weapons in the Palace of the Forest;
9you saw that the City of David had
many breaches in its defenses; you
stored up water in the Lower Pool.
10You counted the buildings in
Jerusalem and tore down houses to
strengthen the wall.
11You built a reservoir between the two
walls for the water of the Old Pool, but
you did not look to the One who made it,
or have regard for the One who planned
it long ago.
12The Lord, the Lord Almighty, called
you on that day to weep and to wail, to
tear out your hair and put on sackcloth.
13But see, there is joy and revelry,
slaughtering of cattle and killing of
sheep, eating of meat and drinking of
wine! "Let us eat and drink," you say,
"for tomorrow we die!"
14The Lord Almighty has revealed this in
my hearing: "Till your dying day this sin
will not be atoned for," says the Lord,
the Lord Almighty.
15This is what the Lord, the Lord
Almighty, says: "Go, say to this steward,
to Shebna, who is in charge of the
palace:
16What are you doing here and who
gave you permission to cut out a grave
for yourself here, hewing your grave on
the height and chiseling your resting
place in the rock?
17"Beware, the Lord is about to take firm
hold of you and hurl you away, O you
mighty man.
18He will roll you up tightly like a ball and
throw you into a large country. There
you will die and there your splendid
chariots will remain- you disgrace to
your master's house!
19I will depose you from your office, and
you will be ousted from your position.
20"In that day I will summon my servant,
Eliakim son of Hilkiah.
21I will clothe him with your robe and
fasten your sash around him and hand
your authority over to him. He will be a
father to those who live in Jerusalem
and to the house of Judah.
22I will place on his shoulder the key to
the house of David; what he opens no
one can shut, and what he shuts no one
can open.
23I will drive him like a peg into a firm
place; he will be a seat of honor for the
house of his father.
24All the glory of his family will hang on
him: its offspring and offshoots-all its
lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the
jars.
25"In that day," declares the Lord
Almighty, "the peg driven into the firm
place will give way; it will be sheared off
and will fall, and the load hanging on it
will be cut down." The Lord has spoken.
23An oracle concerning Tyre: Wail,
O ships of Tarshish! For Tyre is
destroyed and left without house or
harbor. From the land of Cyprus word
has come to them.
2Be silent, you people of the island and
you merchants of Sidon, whom the
seafarers have enriched.
3On the great waters came the grain of
the Shihor; the harvest of the Nile was
the revenue of Tyre, and she became
the marketplace of the nations.
4Be ashamed, O Sidon, and you, O
fortress of the sea, for the sea has
spoken: "I have neither been in labor nor
given birth; I have neither reared sons
nor brought up daughters."
5When word comes to Egypt, they will
be in anguish at the report from Tyre.
6Cross over to Tarshish; wail, you
people of the island.
7Is this your city of revelry, the old, old
city, whose feet have taken her to settle
in far-off lands?
8Who planned this against Tyre, the
bestower of crowns, whose merchants
are princes, whose traders are
renowned in the earth?
9The Lord Almighty planned it, to bring
low the pride of all glory and to humble
all who are renowned on the earth.
10Till your land as along the Nile, O
Daughter of Tarshish, for you no longer
have a harbor.
11The Lord has stretched out his hand
over the sea and made its kingdoms
tremble. He has given an order
concerning Phoenicia that her fortresses
be destroyed.
12He said, "No more of your reveling, O
Virgin Daughter of Sidon, now crushed!
"Up, cross over to Cyprus ; even there
you will find no rest."
13Look at the land of the Babylonians,
this people that is now of no account!
The Assyrians have made it a place for
desert creatures; they raised up their
siege towers, they stripped its fortresses
bare and turned it into a ruin.
14Wail, you ships of Tarshish; your
fortress is destroyed!
15At that time Tyre will be forgotten for
seventy years, the span of a king's life.
But at the end of these seventy years, it
will happen to Tyre as in the song of the
prostitute:
16"Take up a harp, walk through the city,
O prostitute forgotten; play the harp well,
sing many a song, so that you will be
remembered."
17At the end of seventy years, the Lord
will deal with Tyre. She will return to her
hire as a prostitute and will ply her trade
with all the kingdoms on the face of the
earth.
18Yet her profit and her earnings will be
set apart for the Lord ; they will not be
stored up or hoarded. Her profits will go
to those who live before the Lord , for
abundant food and fine clothes.
24See, the Lord is going to lay waste
the earth and devastate it; he will ruin its
face and scatter its inhabitants-
2it will be the same for priest as for
people, for master as for servant, for
mistress as for maid, for seller as for
buyer, for borrower as for lender, for
debtor as for creditor.
3The earth will be completely laid waste
and totally plundered. The Lord has
spoken this word.
4The earth dries up and withers, the
world languishes and withers, the
exalted of the earth languish.
5The earth is defiled by its people; they
have disobeyed the laws, violated the
statutes and broken the everlasting
covenant.
6Therefore a curse consumes the earth;
its people must bear their guilt.
Therefore earth's inhabitants are burned
up, and very few are left.
7The new wine dries up and the vine
withers; all the merrymakers groan.
8The gaiety of the tambourines is stilled,
the noise of the revelers has stopped,
the joyful harp is silent.
9No longer do they drink wine with a
song; the beer is bitter to its drinkers.
10The ruined city lies desolate; the
entrance to every house is barred.
11In the streets they cry out for wine; all
joy turns to gloom, all gaiety is banished
from the earth.
12The city is left in ruins, its gate is
battered to pieces.
13So will it be on the earth and among
the nations, as when an olive tree is
beaten, or as when gleanings are left
after the grape harvest.
14They raise their voices, they shout for
joy; from the west they acclaim the Lord
's majesty.
15Therefore in the east give glory to the
Lord ; exalt the name of the Lord , the
God of Israel, in the islands of the sea.
16From the ends of the earth we hear
singing: "Glory to the Righteous One."
But I said, "I waste away, I waste away!
Woe to me! The treacherous betray!
With treachery the treacherous betray!"
17Terror and pit and snare await you, O
people of the earth.
18Whoever flees at the sound of terror
will fall into a pit; whoever climbs out of
the pit will be caught in a snare. The
floodgates of the heavens are opened,
the foundations of the earth shake.
19The earth is broken up, the earth is
split asunder, the earth is thoroughly
shaken.
20The earth reels like a drunkard, it
sways like a hut in the wind; so heavy
upon it is the guilt of its rebellion that it
falls-never to rise again.
21In that day the Lord will punish the
powers in the heavens above and the
kings on the earth below.
22They will be herded together like
prisoners bound in a dungeon; they will
be shut up in prison and be punished
after many days.
23The moon will be abashed, the sun
ashamed; for the Lord Almighty will
reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,
and before its elders, gloriously.
25O Lord , you are my God; I will
exalt you and praise your name, for in
perfect faithfulness you have done
marvelous things, things planned long
ago.
2You have made the city a heap of
rubble, the fortified town a ruin, the
foreigners' stronghold a city no more; it
will never be rebuilt.
3Therefore strong peoples will honor
you; cities of ruthless nations will revere
you.
4You have been a refuge for the poor, a
refuge for the needy in his distress, a
shelter from the storm and a shade from
the heat. For the breath of the ruthless
is like a storm driving against a wall
5and like the heat of the desert. You
silence the uproar of foreigners; as heat
is reduced by the shadow of a cloud, so
the song of the ruthless is stilled.
6On this mountain the Lord Almighty will
prepare a feast of rich food for all
peoples, a banquet of aged wine- the
best of meats and the finest of wines.
7On this mountain he will destroy the
shroud that enfolds all peoples, the
sheet that covers all nations;
8he will swallow up death forever. The
Sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears
from all faces; he will remove the
disgrace of his people from all the earth.
The Lord has spoken.
9In that day they will say, "Surely this is
our God; we trusted in him, and he
saved us. This is the Lord , we trusted in
him; let us rejoice and be glad in his
salvation."
10The hand of the Lord will rest on this
mountain; but Moab will be trampled
under him as straw is trampled down in
the manure.
11They will spread out their hands in it,
as a swimmer spreads out his hands to
swim. God will bring down their pride
despite the cleverness of their hands.
12He will bring down your high fortified
walls and lay them low; he will bring
them down to the ground, to the very
dust.
26In that day this song will be sung
in the land of Judah: We have a strong
city; God makes salvation its walls and
ramparts.
2Open the gates that the righteous
nation may enter, the nation that keeps
faith.
3You will keep in perfect peace him
whose mind is steadfast, because he
trusts in you.
4Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord ,
the Lord , is the Rock eternal.
5He humbles those who dwell on high,
he lays the lofty city low; he levels it to
the ground and casts it down to the dust.
6Feet trample it down- the feet of the
oppressed, the footsteps of the poor.
7The path of the righteous is level; O
upright One, you make the way of the
righteous smooth.
8Yes, Lord , walking in the way of your
laws, we wait for you; your name and
renown are the desire of our hearts.
9My soul yearns for you in the night; in
the morning my spirit longs for you.
When your judgments come upon the
earth, the people of the world learn
righteousness.
10Though grace is shown to the wicked,
they do not learn righteousness; even in
a land of uprightness they go on doing
evil and regard not the majesty of the
Lord .
11O Lord , your hand is lifted high, but
they do not see it. Let them see your
zeal for your people and be put to
shame; let the fire reserved for your
enemies consume them.
12Lord , you establish peace for us; all
that we have accomplished you have
done for us.
13O Lord , our God, other lords besides
you have ruled over us, but your name
alone do we honor.
14They are now dead, they live no more;
those departed spirits do not rise. You
punished them and brought them to
ruin; you wiped out all memory of them.
15You have enlarged the nation, O Lord ;
you have enlarged the nation. You have
gained glory for yourself; you have
extended all the borders of the land.
16Lord , they came to you in their
distress; when you disciplined them,
they could barely whisper a prayer.
17As a woman with child and about to
give birth writhes and cries out in her
pain, so were we in your presence, O
Lord .
18We were with child, we writhed in pain,
but we gave birth to wind. We have not
brought salvation to the earth; we have
not given birth to people of the world.
19But your dead will live; their bodies will
rise. You who dwell in the dust, wake up
and shout for joy. Your dew is like the
dew of the morning; the earth will give
birth to her dead.
20Go, my people, enter your rooms and
shut the doors behind you; hide
yourselves for a little while until his
wrath has passed by.
21See, the Lord is coming out of his
dwelling to punish the people of the
earth for their sins. The earth will
disclose the blood shed upon her; she
will conceal her slain no longer.
27In that day, the Lord will punish
with his sword, his fierce, great and
powerful sword, Leviathan the gliding
serpent, Leviathan the coiling serpent;
he will slay the monster of the sea.
2In that day- "Sing about a fruitful
vineyard:
3I, the Lord , watch over it; I water it
continually. I guard it day and night so
that no one may harm it.
4I am not angry. If only there were briers
and thorns confronting me! I would
march against them in battle; I would set
them all on fire.
5Or else let them come to me for refuge;
let them make peace with me, yes, let
them make peace with me."
6In days to come Jacob will take root,
Israel will bud and blossom and fill all
the world with fruit.
7Has the Lord struck her as he struck
down those who struck her? Has she
been killed as those were killed who
killed her?
8By warfare and exile you contend with
her- with his fierce blast he drives her
out, as on a day the east wind blows.
9By this, then, will Jacob's guilt be
atoned for, and this will be the full
fruitage of the removal of his sin: When
he makes all the altar stones to be like
chalk stones crushed to pieces, no
Asherah poles or incense altars will be
left standing.
10The fortified city stands desolate, an
abandoned settlement, forsaken like the
desert; there the calves graze, there
they lie down; they strip its branches
bare.
11When its twigs are dry, they are
broken off and women come and make
fires with them. For this is a people
without understanding; so their Maker
has no compassion on them, and their
Creator shows them no favor.
12In that day the Lord will thresh from
the flowing Euphrates to the Wadi of
Egypt, and you, O Israelites, will be
gathered up one by one.
13And in that day a great trumpet will
sound. Those who were perishing in
Assyria and those who were exiled in
Egypt will come and worship the Lord on
the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
28Woe to that wreath, the pride of
Ephraim's drunkards, to the fading
flower, his glorious beauty, set on the
head of a fertile valley- to that city, the
pride of those laid low by wine!
2See, the Lord has one who is powerful
and strong. Like a hailstorm and a
destructive wind, like a driving rain and
a flooding downpour, he will throw it
forcefully to the ground.
3That wreath, the pride of Ephraim's
drunkards, will be trampled underfoot.
4That fading flower, his glorious beauty,
set on the head of a fertile valley, will be
like a fig ripe before harvest- as soon as
someone sees it and takes it in his hand,
he swallows it.
5In that day the Lord Almighty will be a
glorious crown, a beautiful wreath for
the remnant of his people.
6He will be a spirit of justice to him who
sits in judgment, a source of strength to
those who turn back the battle at the
gate.
7And these also stagger from wine and
reel from beer: Priests and prophets
stagger from beer and are befuddled
with wine; they reel from beer, they
stagger when seeing visions, they
stumble when rendering decisions.
8All the tables are covered with vomit
and there is not a spot without filth.
9"Who is it he is trying to teach? To
whom is he explaining his message? To
children weaned from their milk, to those
just taken from the breast?
10For it is: Do and do, do and do, rule on
rule, rule on rule ; a little here, a little
there."
11Very well then, with foreign lips and
strange tongues God will speak to this
people,
12to whom he said, "This is the resting
place, let the weary rest"; and, "This is
the place of repose"- but they would not
listen.
13So then, the word of the Lord to them
will become: Do and do, do and do, rule
on rule, rule on rule; a little here, a little
there- so that they will go and fall
backward, be injured and snared and
captured.
14Therefore hear the word of the Lord ,
you scoffers who rule this people in
Jerusalem.
15You boast, "We have entered into a
covenant with death, with the grave we
have made an agreement. When an
overwhelming scourge sweeps by, it
cannot touch us, for we have made a lie
our refuge and falsehood our hiding
place."
16So this is what the Sovereign Lord
says: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a
tested stone, a precious cornerstone for
a sure foundation; the one who trusts
will never be dismayed.
17I will make justice the measuring line
and righteousness the plumb line; hail
will sweep away your refuge, the lie, and
water will overflow your hiding place.
18Your covenant with death will be
annulled; your agreement with the grave
will not stand. When the overwhelming
scourge sweeps by, you will be beaten
down by it.
19As often as it comes it will carry you
away; morning after morning, by day
and by night, it will sweep through." The
understanding of this message will bring
sheer terror.
20The bed is too short to stretch out on,
the blanket too narrow to wrap around
you.
21The Lord will rise up as he did at
Mount Perazim, he will rouse himself as
in the Valley of Gibeon- to do his work,
his strange work, and perform his task,
his alien task.
22Now stop your mocking, or your chains
will become heavier; the Lord, the Lord
Almighty, has told me of the destruction
decreed against the whole land.
23Listen and hear my voice; pay
attention and hear what I say.
24When a farmer plows for planting,
does he plow continually? Does he keep
on breaking up and harrowing the soil?
25When he has leveled the surface,
does he not sow caraway and scatter
cummin? Does he not plant wheat in its
place, barley in its plot, and spelt in its
field?
26His God instructs him and teaches him
the right way.
27Caraway is not threshed with a sledge,
nor is a cartwheel rolled over cummin;
caraway is beaten out with a rod, and
cummin with a stick.
28Grain must be ground to make bread;
so one does not go on threshing it
forever. Though he drives the wheels of
his threshing cart over it, his horses do
not grind it.
29All this also comes from the Lord
Almighty, wonderful in counsel and
magnificent in wisdom.
29Woe to you, Ariel, Ariel, the city
where David settled! Add year to year
and let your cycle of festivals go on.
2Yet I will besiege Ariel; she will mourn
and lament, she will be to me like an
altar hearth.
3I will encamp against you all around; I
will encircle you with towers and set up
my siege works against you.
4Brought low, you will speak from the
ground; your speech will mumble out of
the dust. Your voice will come ghostlike
from the earth; out of the dust your
speech will whisper.
5But your many enemies will become
like fine dust, the ruthless hordes like
blown chaff. Suddenly, in an instant,
6the Lord Almighty will come with
thunder and earthquake and great noise,
with windstorm and tempest and flames
of a devouring fire.
7Then the hordes of all the nations that
fight against Ariel, that attack her and
her fortress and besiege her, will be as it
is with a dream, with a vision in the
night-
8as when a hungry man dreams that he
is eating, but he awakens, and his
hunger remains; as when a thirsty man
dreams that he is drinking, but he
awakens faint, with his thirst
unquenched. So will it be with the
hordes of all the nations that fight
against Mount Zion.
9Be stunned and amazed, blind
yourselves and be sightless; be drunk,
but not from wine, stagger, but not from
beer.
10The Lord has brought over you a deep
sleep: He has sealed your eyes (the
prophets); he has covered your heads
(the seers).
11For you this whole vision is nothing but
words sealed in a scroll. And if you give
the scroll to someone who can read,
and say to him, "Read this, please," he
will answer, "I can't; it is sealed."
12Or if you give the scroll to someone
who cannot read, and say, "Read this,
please," he will answer, "I don't know
how to read."
13The Lord says: "These people come
near to me with their mouth and honor
me with their lips, but their hearts are far
from me. Their worship of me is made
up only of rules taught by men.
14Therefore once more I will astound
these people with wonder upon wonder;
the wisdom of the wise will perish, the
intelligence of the intelligent will vanish."
15Woe to those who go to great depths
to hide their plans from the Lord , who
do their work in darkness and think,
"Who sees us? Who will know?"
16You turn things upside down, as if the
potter were thought to be like the clay!
Shall what is formed say to him who
formed it, "He did not make me"? Can
the pot say of the potter, "He knows
nothing"?
17In a very short time, will not Lebanon
be turned into a fertile field and the
fertile field seem like a forest?
18In that day the deaf will hear the words
of the scroll, and out of gloom and
darkness the eyes of the blind will see.
19Once more the humble will rejoice in
the Lord ; the needy will rejoice in the
Holy One of Israel.
20The ruthless will vanish, the mockers
will disappear, and all who have an eye
for evil will be cut down21those
who with a word make a man
out to be guilty, who ensnare the
defender in court and with false
testimony deprive the innocent of justice.
22Therefore this is what the Lord , who
redeemed Abraham, says to the house
of Jacob: "No longer will Jacob be
ashamed; no longer will their faces grow
pale.
23When they see among them their
children, the work of my hands, they will
keep my name holy; they will
acknowledge the holiness of the Holy
One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of
the God of Israel.
24Those who are wayward in spirit will
gain understanding; those who complain
will accept instruction."
30"Woe to the obstinate children,"
declares the Lord , "to those who carry
out plans that are not mine, forming an
alliance, but not by my Spirit, heaping
sin upon sin;
2who go down to Egypt without
consulting me; who look for help to
Pharaoh's protection, to Egypt's shade
for refuge.
3But Pharaoh's protection will be to your
shame, Egypt's shade will bring you
disgrace.
4Though they have officials in Zoan and
their envoys have arrived in Hanes,
5everyone will be put to shame because
of a people useless to them, who bring
neither help nor advantage, but only
shame and disgrace."
6An oracle concerning the animals of the
Negev: Through a land of hardship and
distress, of lions and lionesses, of
adders and darting snakes, the envoys
carry their riches on donkeys' backs,
their treasures on the humps of camels,
to that unprofitable nation,
7to Egypt, whose help is utterly useless.
Therefore I call her Rahab the Do-
Nothing.
8Go now, write it on a tablet for them,
inscribe it on a scroll, that for the days to
come it may be an everlasting witness.
9These are rebellious people, deceitful
children, children unwilling to listen to
the Lord 's instruction.
10They say to the seers, "See no more
visions!" and to the prophets, "Give us
no more visions of what is right! Tell us
pleasant things, prophesy illusions.
11Leave this way, get off this path, and
stop confronting us with the Holy One of
Israel!"
12Therefore, this is what the Holy One of
Israel says: "Because you have rejected
this message, relied on oppression and
depended on deceit,
13this sin will become for you like a high
wall, cracked and bulging, that collapses
suddenly, in an instant.
14It will break in pieces like pottery,
shattered so mercilessly that among its
pieces not a fragment will be found for
taking coals from a hearth or scooping
water out of a cistern."
15This is what the Sovereign Lord , the
Holy One of Israel, says: "In repentance
and rest is your salvation, in quietness
and trust is your strength, but you would
have none of it.
16You said, 'No, we will flee on horses.'
Therefore you will flee! You said, 'We
will ride off on swift horses.' Therefore
your pursuers will be swift!
17A thousand will flee at the threat of
one; at the threat of five you will all flee
away, till you are left like a flagstaff on a
mountaintop, like a banner on a hill."
18Yet the Lord longs to be gracious to
you; he rises to show you compassion.
For the Lord is a God of justice. Blessed
are all who wait for him!
19O people of Zion, who live in
Jerusalem, you will weep no more. How
gracious he will be when you cry for
help! As soon as he hears, he will
answer you.
20Although the Lord gives you the bread
of adversity and the water of affliction,
your teachers will be hidden no more;
with your own eyes you will see them.
21Whether you turn to the right or to the
left, your ears will hear a voice behind
you, saying, "This is the way; walk in it."
22Then you will defile your idols overlaid
with silver and your images covered with
gold; you will throw them away like a
menstrual cloth and say to them, "Away
with you!"
23He will also send you rain for the seed
you sow in the ground, and the food that
comes from the land will be rich and
plentiful. In that day your cattle will
graze in broad meadows.
24The oxen and donkeys that work the
soil will eat fodder and mash, spread out
with fork and shovel.
25In the day of great slaughter, when the
towers fall, streams of water will flow on
every high mountain and every lofty hill.
26The moon will shine like the sun, and
the sunlight will be seven times brighter,
like the light of seven full days, when the
Lord binds up the bruises of his people
and heals the wounds he inflicted.
27See, the Name of the Lord comes from
afar, with burning anger and dense
clouds of smoke; his lips are full of wrath,
and his tongue is a consuming fire.
28His breath is like a rushing torrent,
rising up to the neck. He shakes the
nations in the sieve of destruction; he
places in the jaws of the peoples a bit
that leads them astray.
29And you will sing as on the night you
celebrate a holy festival; your hearts will
rejoice as when people go up with flutes
to the mountain of the Lord , to the Rock
of Israel.
30The Lord will cause men to hear his
majestic voice and will make them see
his arm coming down with raging anger
and consuming fire, with cloudburst,
thunderstorm and hail.
31The voice of the Lord will shatter
Assyria; with his scepter he will strike
them down.
32Every stroke the Lord lays on them
with his punishing rod will be to the
music of tambourines and harps, as he
fights them in battle with the blows of his
arm.
33Topheth has long been prepared; it
has been made ready for the king. Its
fire pit has been made deep and wide,
with an abundance of fire and wood; the
breath of the Lord , like a stream of
burning sulfur, sets it ablaze.
31Woe to those who go down to
Egypt for help, who rely on horses, who
trust in the multitude of their chariots
and in the great strength of their
horsemen, but do not look to the Holy
One of Israel, or seek help from the
Lord .
2Yet he too is wise and can bring
disaster; he does not take back his
words. He will rise up against the house
of the wicked, against those who help
evildoers.
3But the Egyptians are men and not
God; their horses are flesh and not spirit.
When the Lord stretches out his hand,
he who helps will stumble, he who is
helped will fall; both will perish together.
4This is what the Lord says to me: "As a
lion growls, a great lion over his preyand
though a whole band of shepherds
is called together against him, he is not
frightened by their shouts or disturbed
by their clamor- so the Lord Almighty will
come down to do battle on Mount Zion
and on its heights.
5Like birds hovering overhead, the Lord
Almighty will shield Jerusalem; he will
shield it and deliver it, he will 'pass over'
it and will rescue it."
6Return to him you have so greatly
revolted against, O Israelites.
7For in that day every one of you will
reject the idols of silver and gold your
sinful hands have made.
8"Assyria will fall by a sword that is not
of man; a sword, not of mortals, will
devour them. They will flee before the
sword and their young men will be put to
forced labor.
9Their stronghold will fall because of
terror; at sight of the battle standard
their commanders will panic," declares
the Lord , whose fire is in Zion, whose
furnace is in Jerusalem.
32See, a king will reign in
righteousness and rulers will rule with
justice.
2Each man will be like a shelter from the
wind and a refuge from the storm, like
streams of water in the desert and the
shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land.
3Then the eyes of those who see will no
longer be closed, and the ears of those
who hear will listen.
4The mind of the rash will know and
understand, and the stammering tongue
will be fluent and clear.
5No longer will the fool be called noble
nor the scoundrel be highly respected.
6For the fool speaks folly, his mind is
busy with evil: He practices ungodliness
and spreads error concerning the Lord ;
the hungry he leaves empty and from
the thirsty he withholds water.
7The scoundrel's methods are wicked,
he makes up evil schemes to destroy
the poor with lies, even when the plea of
the needy is just.
8But the noble man makes noble plans,
and by noble deeds he stands.
9You women who are so complacent,
rise up and listen to me; you daughters
who feel secure, hear what I have to
say!
10In little more than a year you who feel
secure will tremble; the grape harvest
will fail, and the harvest of fruit will not
come.
11Tremble, you complacent women;
shudder, you daughters who feel
secure! Strip off your clothes, put
sackcloth around your waists.
12Beat your breasts for the pleasant
fields, for the fruitful vines
13and for the land of my people, a land
overgrown with thorns and briers- yes,
mourn for all houses of merriment and
for this city of revelry.
14The fortress will be abandoned, the
noisy city deserted; citadel and
watchtower will become a wasteland
forever, the delight of donkeys, a
pasture for flocks,
15till the Spirit is poured upon us from on
high, and the desert becomes a fertile
field, and the fertile field seems like a
forest.
16Justice will dwell in the desert and
righteousness live in the fertile field.
17The fruit of righteousness will be
peace; the effect of righteousness will
be quietness and confidence forever.
18My people will live in peaceful dwelling
places, in secure homes, in undisturbed
places of rest.
19Though hail flattens the forest and the
city is leveled completely,
20how blessed you will be, sowing your
seed by every stream, and letting your
cattle and donkeys range free.
33Woe to you, O destroyer, you who
have not been destroyed! Woe to you, O
traitor, you who have not been betrayed!
When you stop destroying, you will be
destroyed; when you stop betraying, you
will be betrayed.
2O Lord , be gracious to us; we long for
you. Be our strength every morning, our
salvation in time of distress.
3At the thunder of your voice, the
peoples flee; when you rise up, the
nations scatter.
4Your plunder, O nations, is harvested
as by young locusts; like a swarm of
locusts men pounce on it.
5The Lord is exalted, for he dwells on
high; he will fill Zion with justice and
righteousness.
6He will be the sure foundation for your
times, a rich store of salvation and
wisdom and knowledge; the fear of the
Lord is the key to this treasure.
7Look, their brave men cry aloud in the
streets; the envoys of peace weep
bitterly.
8The highways are deserted, no
travelers are on the roads. The treaty is
broken, its witnesses are despised, no
one is respected.
9The land mourns and wastes away,
Lebanon is ashamed and withers;
Sharon is like the Arabah, and Bashan
and Carmel drop their leaves.
10"Now will I arise," says the Lord . "Now
will I be exalted; now will I be lifted up.
11You conceive chaff, you give birth to
straw; your breath is a fire that
consumes you.
12The peoples will be burned as if to
lime; like cut thornbushes they will be
set ablaze."
13You who are far away, hear what I
have done; you who are near,
acknowledge my power!
14The sinners in Zion are terrified;
trembling grips the godless: "Who of us
can dwell with the consuming fire? Who
of us can dwell with everlasting
burning?"
15He who walks righteously and speaks
what is right, who rejects gain from
extortion and keeps his hand from
accepting bribes, who stops his ears
against plots of murder and shuts his
eyes against contemplating evil-
16this is the man who will dwell on the
heights, whose refuge will be the
mountain fortress. His bread will be
supplied, and water will not fail him.
17Your eyes will see the king in his
beauty and view a land that stretches
afar.
18In your thoughts you will ponder the
former terror: "Where is that chief
officer? Where is the one who took the
revenue? Where is the officer in charge
of the towers?"
19You will see those arrogant people no
more, those people of an obscure
speech, with their strange,
incomprehensible tongue.
20Look upon Zion, the city of our
festivals; your eyes will see Jerusalem,
a peaceful abode, a tent that will not be
moved; its stakes will never be pulled up,
nor any of its ropes broken.
21There the Lord will be our Mighty One.
It will be like a place of broad rivers and
streams. No galley with oars will ride
them, no mighty ship will sail them.
22For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is
our lawgiver, the Lord is our king; it is he
who will save us.
23Your rigging hangs loose: The mast is
not held secure, the sail is not spread.
Then an abundance of spoils will be
divided and even the lame will carry off
plunder.
24No one living in Zion will say, "I am ill";
and the sins of those who dwell there
will be forgiven.
34Come near, you nations, and
listen; pay attention, you peoples! Let
the earth hear, and all that is in it, the
world, and all that comes out of it!
2The Lord is angry with all nations; his
wrath is upon all their armies. He will
totally destroy them, he will give them
over to slaughter.
3Their slain will be thrown out, their dead
bodies will send up a stench; the
mountains will be soaked with their
blood.
4All the stars of the heavens will be
dissolved and the sky rolled up like a
scroll; all the starry host will fall like
withered leaves from the vine, like
shriveled figs from the fig tree.
5My sword has drunk its fill in the
heavens; see, it descends in judgment
on Edom, the people I have totally
destroyed.
6The sword of the Lord is bathed in
blood, it is covered with fat- the blood of
lambs and goats, fat from the kidneys of
rams. For the Lord has a sacrifice in
Bozrah and a great slaughter in Edom.
7And the wild oxen will fall with them, the
bull calves and the great bulls. Their
land will be drenched with blood, and
the dust will be soaked with fat.
8For the Lord has a day of vengeance, a
year of retribution, to uphold Zion's
cause.
9Edom's streams will be turned into pitch,
her dust into burning sulfur; her land will
become blazing pitch!
10It will not be quenched night and day;
its smoke will rise forever. From
generation to generation it will lie
desolate; no one will ever pass through
it again.
11The desert owl and screech owl will
possess it; the great owl and the raven
will nest there. God will stretch out over
Edom the measuring line of chaos and
the plumb line of desolation.
12Her nobles will have nothing there to
be called a kingdom, all her princes will
vanish away.
13Thorns will overrun her citadels,
nettles and brambles her strongholds.
She will become a haunt for jackals, a
home for owls.
14Desert creatures will meet with hyenas,
and wild goats will bleat to each other;
there the night creatures will also repose
and find for themselves places of rest.
15The owl will nest there and lay eggs,
she will hatch them, and care for her
young under the shadow of her wings;
there also the falcons will gather, each
with its mate.
16Look in the scroll of the Lord and read:
None of these will be missing, not one
will lack her mate. For it is his mouth
that has given the order, and his Spirit
will gather them together.
17He allots their portions; his hand
distributes them by measure. They will
possess it forever and dwell there from
generation to generation.
35The desert and the parched land
will be glad; the wilderness will rejoice
and blossom. Like the crocus,
2it will burst into bloom; it will rejoice
greatly and shout for joy. The glory of
Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor
of Carmel and Sharon; they will see the
glory of the Lord , the splendor of our
God.
3Strengthen the feeble hands, steady
the knees that give way;
4say to those with fearful hearts, "Be
strong, do not fear; your God will come,
he will come with vengeance; with divine
retribution he will come to save you."
5Then will the eyes of the blind be
opened and the ears of the deaf
unstopped.
6Then will the lame leap like a deer, and
the mute tongue shout for joy. Water will
gush forth in the wilderness and streams
in the desert.
7The burning sand will become a pool,
the thirsty ground bubbling springs. In
the haunts where jackals once lay,
grass and reeds and papyrus will grow.
8And a highway will be there; it will be
called the Way of Holiness. The unclean
will not journey on it; it will be for those
who walk in that Way; wicked fools will
not go about on it.
9No lion will be there, nor will any
ferocious beast get up on it; they will not
be found there. But only the redeemed
will walk there,
10and the ransomed of the Lord will
return. They will enter Zion with singing;
everlasting joy will crown their heads.
Gladness and joy will overtake them,
and sorrow and sighing will flee away.
36In the fourteenth year of King
Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib king of
Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of
Judah and captured them.
2Then the king of Assyria sent his field
commander with a large army from
Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem.
When the commander stopped at the
aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road
to the Washerman's Field,
3Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace
administrator, Shebna the secretary,
and Joah son of Asaph the recorder
went out to him.
4The field commander said to them,
"Tell Hezekiah, " 'This is what the great
king, the king of Assyria, says: On what
are you basing this confidence of yours?
5You say you have strategy and military
strength-but you speak only empty
words. On whom are you depending,
that you rebel against me?
6Look now, you are depending on Egypt,
that splintered reed of a staff, which
pierces a man's hand and wounds him if
he leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of
Egypt to all who depend on him.
7And if you say to me, "We are
depending on the Lord our God"-isn't he
the one whose high places and altars
Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and
Jerusalem, "You must worship before
this altar"?
8" 'Come now, make a bargain with my
master, the king of Assyria: I will give
you two thousand horses-if you can put
riders on them!
9How then can you repulse one officer of
the least of my master's officials, even
though you are depending on Egypt for
chariots and horsemen?
10Furthermore, have I come to attack
and destroy this land without the Lord ?
The Lord himself told me to march
against this country and destroy it.' "
11Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said
to the field commander, "Please speak
to your servants in Aramaic, since we
understand it. Don't speak to us in
Hebrew in the hearing of the people on
the wall."
12But the commander replied, "Was it
only to your master and you that my
master sent me to say these things, and
not to the men sitting on the wall-who,
like you, will have to eat their own filth
and drink their own urine?"
13Then the commander stood and called
out in Hebrew, "Hear the words of the
great king, the king of Assyria!
14This is what the king says: Do not let
Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot
deliver you!
15Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to
trust in the Lord when he says, 'The
Lord will surely deliver us; this city will
not be given into the hand of the king of
Assyria.'
16"Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is
what the king of Assyria says: Make
peace with me and come out to me.
Then every one of you will eat from his
own vine and fig tree and drink water
from his own cistern,
17until I come and take you to a land like
your own-a land of grain and new wine,
a land of bread and vineyards.
18"Do not let Hezekiah mislead you
when he says, 'The Lord will deliver us.'
Has the god of any nation ever delivered
his land from the hand of the king of
Assyria?
19Where are the gods of Hamath and
Arpad? Where are the gods of
Sepharvaim? Have they rescued
Samaria from my hand?
20Who of all the gods of these countries
has been able to save his land from
me? How then can the Lord deliver
Jerusalem from my hand?"
21But the people remained silent and
said nothing in reply, because the king
had commanded, "Do not answer him."
22Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace
administrator, Shebna the secretary,
and Joah son of Asaph the recorder
went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn,
and told him what the field commander
had said.
37When King Hezekiah heard this,
he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth
and went into the temple of the Lord .
2He sent Eliakim the palace
administrator, Shebna the secretary,
and the leading priests, all wearing
sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of
Amoz.
3They told him, "This is what Hezekiah
says: This day is a day of distress and
rebuke and disgrace, as when children
come to the point of birth and there is no
strength to deliver them.
4It may be that the Lord your God will
hear the words of the field commander,
whom his master, the king of Assyria,
has sent to ridicule the living God, and
that he will rebuke him for the words the
Lord your God has heard. Therefore
pray for the remnant that still survives."
5When King Hezekiah's officials came to
Isaiah,
6Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master,
'This is what the Lord says: Do not be
afraid of what you have heard-those
words with which the underlings of the
king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
7Listen! I am going to put a spirit in him
so that when he hears a certain report,
he will return to his own country, and
there I will have him cut down with the
sword.' "
8When the field commander heard that
the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he
withdrew and found the king fighting
against Libnah.
9Now Sennacherib received a report that
Tirhakah, the Cushite king of Egypt ,
was marching out to fight against him.
When he heard it, he sent messengers
to Hezekiah with this word:
10"Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do
not let the god you depend on deceive
you when he says, 'Jerusalem will not
be handed over to the king of Assyria.'
11Surely you have heard what the kings
of Assyria have done to all the countries,
destroying them completely. And will
you be delivered?
12Did the gods of the nations that were
destroyed by my forefathers deliver
them-the gods of Gozan, Haran,
Rezeph and the people of Eden who
were in Tel Assar?
13Where is the king of Hamath, the king
of Arpad, the king of the city of
Sepharvaim, or of Hena or Ivvah?"
14Hezekiah received the letter from the
messengers and read it. Then he went
up to the temple of the Lord and spread
it out before the Lord .
15And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord :
16"O Lord Almighty, God of Israel,
enthroned between the cherubim, you
alone are God over all the kingdoms of
the earth. You have made heaven and
earth.
17Give ear, O Lord , and hear; open your
eyes, O Lord , and see; listen to all the
words Sennacherib has sent to insult
the living God.
18"It is true, O Lord , that the Assyrian
kings have laid waste all these peoples
and their lands.
19They have thrown their gods into the
fire and destroyed them, for they were
not gods but only wood and stone,
fashioned by human hands.
20Now, O Lord our God, deliver us from
his hand, so that all kingdoms on earth
may know that you alone, O Lord , are
God. "
21Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a
message to Hezekiah: "This is what the
Lord , the God of Israel, says: Because
you have prayed to me concerning
Sennacherib king of Assyria,
22this is the word the Lord has spoken
against him: "The Virgin Daughter of
Zion despises and mocks you. The
Daughter of Jerusalem tosses her head
as you flee.
23Who is it you have insulted and
blasphemed? Against whom have you
raised your voice and lifted your eyes in
pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
24By your messengers you have heaped
insults on the Lord. And you have said,
'With my many chariots I have ascended
the heights of the mountains, the utmost
heights of Lebanon. I have cut down its
tallest cedars, the choicest of its pines. I
have reached its remotest heights, the
finest of its forests.
25I have dug wells in foreign lands and
drunk the water there. With the soles of
my feet I have dried up all the streams
of Egypt.'
26"Have you not heard? Long ago I
ordained it. In days of old I planned it;
now I have brought it to pass, that you
have turned fortified cities into piles of
stone.
27Their people, drained of power, are
dismayed and put to shame. They are
like plants in the field, like tender green
shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof,
scorched before it grows up.
28"But I know where you stay and when
you come and go and how you rage
against me.
29Because you rage against me and
because your insolence has reached my
ears, I will put my hook in your nose and
my bit in your mouth, and I will make
you return by the way you came.
30"This will be the sign for you, O
Hezekiah: "This year you will eat what
grows by itself, and the second year
what springs from that. But in the third
year sow and reap, plant vineyards and
eat their fruit.
31Once more a remnant of the house of
Judah will take root below and bear fruit
above.
32For out of Jerusalem will come a
remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band
of survivors. The zeal of the Lord
Almighty will accomplish this.
33"Therefore this is what the Lord says
concerning the king of Assyria: "He will
not enter this city or shoot an arrow here.
He will not come before it with shield or
build a siege ramp against it.
34By the way that he came he will return;
he will not enter this city," declares the
Lord .
35"I will defend this city and save it, for
my sake and for the sake of David my
servant!"
36Then the angel of the Lord went out
and put to death a hundred and eightyfive
thousand men in the Assyrian camp.
When the people got up the next
morning-there were all the dead bodies!
37So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke
camp and withdrew. He returned to
Nineveh and stayed there.
38One day, while he was worshiping in
the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons
Adrammelech and Sharezer cut him
down with the sword, and they escaped
to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon
his son succeeded him as king.
38In those days Hezekiah became ill
and was at the point of death. The
prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him
and said, "This is what the Lord says:
Put your house in order, because you
are going to die; you will not recover."
2Hezekiah turned his face to the wall
and prayed to the Lord ,
3"Remember, O Lord , how I have
walked before you faithfully and with
wholehearted devotion and have done
what is good in your eyes." And
Hezekiah wept bitterly.
4Then the word of the Lord came to
Isaiah:
5"Go and tell Hezekiah, 'This is what the
Lord , the God of your father David,
says: I have heard your prayer and seen
your tears; I will add fifteen years to your
life.
6And I will deliver you and this city from
the hand of the king of Assyria. I will
defend this city.
7" 'This is the Lord 's sign to you that the
Lord will do what he has promised:
8I will make the shadow cast by the sun
go back the ten steps it has gone down
on the stairway of Ahaz.' " So the
sunlight went back the ten steps it had
gone down.
9A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah
after his illness and recovery:
10I said, "In the prime of my life must I go
through the gates of death and be
robbed of the rest of my years?"
11I said, "I will not again see the Lord ,
the Lord , in the land of the living; no
longer will I look on mankind, or be with
those who now dwell in this world.
12Like a shepherd's tent my house has
been pulled down and taken from me.
Like a weaver I have rolled up my life,
and he has cut me off from the loom;
day and night you made an end of me.
13I waited patiently till dawn, but like a
lion he broke all my bones; day and
night you made an end of me.
14I cried like a swift or thrush, I moaned
like a mourning dove. My eyes grew
weak as I looked to the heavens. I am
troubled; O Lord, come to my aid!"
15But what can I say? He has spoken to
me, and he himself has done this. I will
walk humbly all my years because of
this anguish of my soul.
16Lord, by such things men live; and my
spirit finds life in them too. You restored
me to health and let me live.
17Surely it was for my benefit that I
suffered such anguish. In your love you
kept me from the pit of destruction; you
have put all my sins behind your back.
18For the grave cannot praise you, death
cannot sing your praise; those who go
down to the pit cannot hope for your
faithfulness.
19The living, the living-they praise you,
as I am doing today; fathers tell their
children about your faithfulness.
20The Lord will save me, and we will
sing with stringed instruments all the
days of our lives in the temple of the
Lord .
21Isaiah had said, "Prepare a poultice of
figs and apply it to the boil, and he will
recover."
22Hezekiah had asked, "What will be the
sign that I will go up to the temple of the
Lord ?"
39At that time Merodach-Baladan
son of Baladan king of Babylon sent
Hezekiah letters and a gift, because he
had heard of his illness and recovery.
2Hezekiah received the envoys gladly
and showed them what was in his
storehouses-the silver, the gold, the
spices, the fine oil, his entire armory and
everything found among his treasures.
There was nothing in his palace or in all
his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show
them.
3Then Isaiah the prophet went to King
Hezekiah and asked, "What did those
men say, and where did they come
from?" "From a distant land," Hezekiah
replied. "They came to me from
Babylon."
4The prophet asked, "What did they see
in your palace?" "They saw everything in
my palace," Hezekiah said. "There is
nothing among my treasures that I did
not show them."
5Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear
the word of the Lord Almighty:
6The time will surely come when
everything in your palace, and all that
your fathers have stored up until this
day, will be carried off to Babylon.
Nothing will be left, says the Lord .
7And some of your descendants, your
own flesh and blood who will be born to
you, will be taken away, and they will
become eunuchs in the palace of the
king of Babylon."
8"The word of the Lord you have spoken
is good," Hezekiah replied. For he
thought, "There will be peace and
security in my lifetime."
40Comfort, comfort my people, says
your God.
2Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and
proclaim to her that her hard service has
been completed, that her sin has been
paid for, that she has received from the
Lord 's hand double for all her sins.
3A voice of one calling: "In the desert
prepare the way for the Lord ; make
straight in the wilderness a highway for
our God.
4Every valley shall be raised up, every
mountain and hill made low; the rough
ground shall become level, the rugged
places a plain.
5And the glory of the Lord will be
revealed, and all mankind together will
see it. For the mouth of the Lord has
spoken."
6A voice says, "Cry out." And I said,
"What shall I cry?" "All men are like
grass, and all their glory is like the
flowers of the field.
7The grass withers and the flowers fall,
because the breath of the Lord blows on
them. Surely the people are grass.
8The grass withers and the flowers fall,
but the word of our God stands forever."
9You who bring good tidings to Zion, go
up on a high mountain. You who bring
good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up your
voice with a shout, lift it up, do not be
afraid; say to the towns of Judah, "Here
is your God!"
10See, the Sovereign Lord comes with
power, and his arm rules for him. See,
his reward is with him, and his
recompense accompanies him.
11He tends his flock like a shepherd: He
gathers the lambs in his arms and
carries them close to his heart; he gently
leads those that have young.
12Who has measured the waters in the
hollow of his hand, or with the breadth of
his hand marked off the heavens? Who
has held the dust of the earth in a
basket, or weighed the mountains on
the scales and the hills in a balance?
13Who has understood the mind of the
Lord , or instructed him as his
counselor?
14Whom did the Lord consult to
enlighten him, and who taught him the
right way? Who was it that taught him
knowledge or showed him the path of
understanding?
15Surely the nations are like a drop in a
bucket; they are regarded as dust on the
scales; he weighs the islands as though
they were fine dust.
16Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires,
nor its animals enough for burnt
offerings.
17Before him all the nations are as
nothing; they are regarded by him as
worthless and less than nothing.
18To whom, then, will you compare
God? What image will you compare him
to?
19As for an idol, a craftsman casts it, and
a goldsmith overlays it with gold and
fashions silver chains for it.
20A man too poor to present such an
offering selects wood that will not rot. He
looks for a skilled craftsman to set up an
idol that will not topple.
21Do you not know? Have you not
heard? Has it not been told you from the
beginning? Have you not understood
since the earth was founded?
22He sits enthroned above the circle of
the earth, and its people are like
grasshoppers. He stretches out the
heavens like a canopy, and spreads
them out like a tent to live in.
23He brings princes to naught and
reduces the rulers of this world to
nothing.
24No sooner are they planted, no sooner
are they sown, no sooner do they take
root in the ground, than he blows on
them and they wither, and a whirlwind
sweeps them away like chaff.
25"To whom will you compare me? Or
who is my equal?" says the Holy One.
26Lift your eyes and look to the heavens:
Who created all these? He who brings
out the starry host one by one, and calls
them each by name. Because of his
great power and mighty strength, not
one of them is missing.
27Why do you say, O Jacob, and
complain, O Israel, "My way is hidden
from the Lord ; my cause is disregarded
by my God"?
28Do you not know? Have you not
heard? The Lord is the everlasting God,
the Creator of the ends of the earth. He
will not grow tired or weary, and his
understanding no one can fathom.
29He gives strength to the weary and
increases the power of the weak.
30Even youths grow tired and weary,
and young men stumble and fall;
31but those who hope in the Lord will
renew their strength. They will soar on
wings like eagles; they will run and not
grow weary, they will walk and not be
faint.
41"Be silent before me, you islands!
Let the nations renew their strength! Let
them come forward and speak; let us
meet together at the place of judgment.
2"Who has stirred up one from the east,
calling him in righteousness to his
service ? He hands nations over to him
and subdues kings before him. He turns
them to dust with his sword, to
windblown chaff with his bow.
3He pursues them and moves on
unscathed, by a path his feet have not
traveled before.
4Who has done this and carried it
through, calling forth the generations
from the beginning? I, the Lord -with the
first of them and with the last-I am he."
5The islands have seen it and fear; the
ends of the earth tremble. They
approach and come forward;
6each helps the other and says to his
brother, "Be strong!"
7The craftsman encourages the
goldsmith, and he who smooths with the
hammer spurs on him who strikes the
anvil. He says of the welding, "It is
good." He nails down the idol so it will
not topple.
8"But you, O Israel, my servant, Jacob,
whom I have chosen, you descendants
of Abraham my friend,
9I took you from the ends of the earth,
from its farthest corners I called you. I
said, 'You are my servant'; I have
chosen you and have not rejected you.
10So do not fear, for I am with you; do
not be dismayed, for I am your God. I
will strengthen you and help you; I will
uphold you with my righteous right hand.
11"All who rage against you will surely be
ashamed and disgraced; those who
oppose you will be as nothing and
perish.
12Though you search for your enemies,
you will not find them. Those who wage
war against you will be as nothing at all.
13For I am the Lord , your God, who
takes hold of your right hand and says
to you, Do not fear; I will help you.
14Do not be afraid, O worm Jacob, O
little Israel, for I myself will help you,"
declares the Lord , your Redeemer, the
Holy One of Israel.
15"See, I will make you into a threshing
sledge, new and sharp, with many teeth.
You will thresh the mountains and crush
them, and reduce the hills to chaff.
16You will winnow them, the wind will
pick them up, and a gale will blow them
away. But you will rejoice in the Lord
and glory in the Holy One of Israel.
17"The poor and needy search for water,
but there is none; their tongues are
parched with thirst. But I the Lord will
answer them; I, the God of Israel, will
not forsake them.
18I will make rivers flow on barren
heights, and springs within the valleys. I
will turn the desert into pools of water,
and the parched ground into springs.
19I will put in the desert the cedar and
the acacia, the myrtle and the olive. I will
set pines in the wasteland, the fir and
the cypress together,
20so that people may see and know,
may consider and understand, that the
hand of the Lord has done this, that the
Holy One of Israel has created it.
21"Present your case," says the Lord .
"Set forth your arguments," says Jacob's
King.
22"Bring in your idols to tell us what is
going to happen. Tell us what the former
things were, so that we may consider
them and know their final outcome. Or
declare to us the things to come,
23tell us what the future holds, so we
may know that you are gods. Do
something, whether good or bad, so that
we will be dismayed and filled with fear.
24But you are less than nothing and your
works are utterly worthless; he who
chooses you is detestable.
25"I have stirred up one from the north,
and he comes- one from the rising sun
who calls on my name. He treads on
rulers as if they were mortar, as if he
were a potter treading the clay.
26Who told of this from the beginning, so
we could know, or beforehand, so we
could say, 'He was right'? No one told of
this, no one foretold it, no one heard any
words from you.
27I was the first to tell Zion, 'Look, here
they are!' I gave to Jerusalem a
messenger of good tidings.
28I look but there is no one- no one
among them to give counsel, no one to
give answer when I ask them.
29See, they are all false! Their deeds
amount to nothing; their images are but
wind and confusion.
42"Here is my servant, whom I
uphold, my chosen one in whom I
delight; I will put my Spirit on him and he
will bring justice to the nations.
2He will not shout or cry out, or raise his
voice in the streets.
3A bruised reed he will not break, and a
smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In
faithfulness he will bring forth justice;
4he will not falter or be discouraged till
he establishes justice on earth. In his
law the islands will put their hope."
5This is what God the Lord says- he who
created the heavens and stretched them
out, who spread out the earth and all
that comes out of it, who gives breath to
its people, and life to those who walk on
it:
6"I, the Lord , have called you in
righteousness; I will take hold of your
hand. I will keep you and will make you
to be a covenant for the people and a
light for the Gentiles,
7to open eyes that are blind, to free
captives from prison and to release from
the dungeon those who sit in darkness.
8"I am the Lord ; that is my name! I will
not give my glory to another or my
praise to idols.
9See, the former things have taken
place, and new things I declare; before
they spring into being I announce them
to you." Song of Praise to the Lord
10Sing to the Lord a new song, his
praise from the ends of the earth, you
who go down to the sea, and all that is
in it, you islands, and all who live in
them.
11Let the desert and its towns raise their
voices; let the settlements where Kedar
lives rejoice. Let the people of Sela sing
for joy; let them shout from the
mountaintops.
12Let them give glory to the Lord and
proclaim his praise in the islands.
13The Lord will march out like a mighty
man, like a warrior he will stir up his
zeal; with a shout he will raise the battle
cry and will triumph over his enemies.
14"For a long time I have kept silent, I
have been quiet and held myself back.
But now, like a woman in childbirth, I cry
out, I gasp and pant.
15I will lay waste the mountains and hills
and dry up all their vegetation; I will turn
rivers into islands and dry up the pools.
16I will lead the blind by ways they have
not known, along unfamiliar paths I will
guide them; I will turn the darkness into
light before them and make the rough
places smooth. These are the things I
will do; I will not forsake them.
17But those who trust in idols, who say
to images, 'You are our gods,' will be
turned back in utter shame. Israel Blind
and Deaf
18"Hear, you deaf; look, you blind, and
see!
19Who is blind but my servant, and deaf
like the messenger I send? Who is blind
like the one committed to me, blind like
the servant of the Lord ?
20You have seen many things, but have
paid no attention; your ears are open,
but you hear nothing."
21It pleased the Lord for the sake of his
righteousness to make his law great and
glorious.
22But this is a people plundered and
looted, all of them trapped in pits or
hidden away in prisons. They have
become plunder, with no one to rescue
them; they have been made loot, with
no one to say, "Send them back."
23Which of you will listen to this or pay
close attention in time to come?
24Who handed Jacob over to become
loot, and Israel to the plunderers? Was it
not the Lord , against whom we have
sinned? For they would not follow his
ways; they did not obey his law.
25So he poured out on them his burning
anger, the violence of war. It enveloped
them in flames, yet they did not
understand; it consumed them, but they
did not take it to heart.
43But now, this is what the Lord
says- he who created you, O Jacob, he
who formed you, O Israel: "Fear not, for
I have redeemed you; I have summoned
you by name; you are mine.
2When you pass through the waters, I
will be with you; and when you pass
through the rivers, they will not sweep
over you. When you walk through the
fire, you will not be burned; the flames
will not set you ablaze.
3For I am the Lord , your God, the Holy
One of Israel, your Savior; I give Egypt
for your ransom, Cush and Seba in your
stead.
4Since you are precious and honored in
my sight, and because I love you, I will
give men in exchange for you, and
people in exchange for your life.
5Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will
bring your children from the east and
gather you from the west.
6I will say to the north, 'Give them up!'
and to the south, 'Do not hold them
back.' Bring my sons from afar and my
daughters from the ends of the earth-
7everyone who is called by my name,
whom I created for my glory, whom I
formed and made."
8Lead out those who have eyes but are
blind, who have ears but are deaf.
9All the nations gather together and the
peoples assemble. Which of them
foretold this and proclaimed to us the
former things? Let them bring in their
witnesses to prove they were right, so
that others may hear and say, "It is
true."
10"You are my witnesses," declares the
Lord , "and my servant whom I have
chosen, so that you may know and
believe me and understand that I am he.
Before me no god was formed, nor will
there be one after me.
11I, even I, am the Lord , and apart from
me there is no savior.
12I have revealed and saved and
proclaimed- I, and not some foreign god
among you. You are my witnesses,"
declares the Lord , "that I am God.
13Yes, and from ancient days I am he.
No one can deliver out of my hand.
When I act, who can reverse it?"
14This is what the Lord says- your
Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: "For
your sake I will send to Babylon and
bring down as fugitives all the
Babylonians, in the ships in which they
took pride.
15I am the Lord , your Holy One, Israel's
Creator, your King."
16This is what the Lord says- he who
made a way through the sea, a path
through the mighty waters,
17who drew out the chariots and horses,
the army and reinforcements together,
and they lay there, never to rise again,
extinguished, snuffed out like a wick:
18"Forget the former things; do not dwell
on the past.
19See, I am doing a new thing! Now it
springs up; do you not perceive it? I am
making a way in the desert and streams
in the wasteland.
20The wild animals honor me, the jackals
and the owls, because I provide water in
the desert and streams in the wasteland,
to give drink to my people, my chosen,
21the people I formed for myself that
they may proclaim my praise.
22"Yet you have not called upon me, O
Jacob, you have not wearied yourselves
for me, O Israel.
23You have not brought me sheep for
burnt offerings, nor honored me with
your sacrifices. I have not burdened you
with grain offerings nor wearied you with
demands for incense.
24You have not bought any fragrant
calamus for me, or lavished on me the
fat of your sacrifices. But you have
burdened me with your sins and wearied
me with your offenses.
25"I, even I, am he who blots out your
transgressions, for my own sake, and
remembers your sins no more.
26Review the past for me, let us argue
the matter together; state the case for
your innocence.
27Your first father sinned; your
spokesmen rebelled against me.
28So I will disgrace the dignitaries of
your temple, and I will consign Jacob to
destruction and Israel to scorn.
44"But now listen, O Jacob, my
servant, Israel, whom I have chosen.
2This is what the Lord says- he who
made you, who formed you in the womb,
and who will help you: Do not be afraid,
O Jacob, my servant, Jeshurun, whom I
have chosen.
3For I will pour water on the thirsty land,
and streams on the dry ground; I will
pour out my Spirit on your offspring, and
my blessing on your descendants.
4They will spring up like grass in a
meadow, like poplar trees by flowing
streams.
5One will say, 'I belong to the Lord ';
another will call himself by the name of
Jacob; still another will write on his hand,
'The Lord 's,' and will take the name
Israel.
6"This is what the Lord says- Israel's
King and Redeemer, the Lord Almighty:
I am the first and I am the last; apart
from me there is no God.
7Who then is like me? Let him proclaim
it. Let him declare and lay out before me
what has happened since I established
my ancient people, and what is yet to
come- yes, let him foretell what will
come.
8Do not tremble, do not be afraid. Did I
not proclaim this and foretell it long ago?
You are my witnesses. Is there any God
besides me? No, there is no other Rock;
I know not one."
9All who make idols are nothing, and the
things they treasure are worthless.
Those who would speak up for them are
blind; they are ignorant, to their own
shame.
10Who shapes a god and casts an idol,
which can profit him nothing?
11He and his kind will be put to shame;
craftsmen are nothing but men. Let
them all come together and take their
stand; they will be brought down to
terror and infamy.
12The blacksmith takes a tool and works
with it in the coals; he shapes an idol
with hammers, he forges it with the
might of his arm. He gets hungry and
loses his strength; he drinks no water
and grows faint.
13The carpenter measures with a line
and makes an outline with a marker; he
roughs it out with chisels and marks it
with compasses. He shapes it in the
form of man, of man in all his glory, that
it may dwell in a shrine.
14He cut down cedars, or perhaps took a
cypress or oak. He let it grow among the
trees of the forest, or planted a pine,
and the rain made it grow.
15It is man's fuel for burning; some of it
he takes and warms himself, he kindles
a fire and bakes bread. But he also
fashions a god and worships it; he
makes an idol and bows down to it.
16Half of the wood he burns in the fire;
over it he prepares his meal, he roasts
his meat and eats his fill. He also warms
himself and says, "Ah! I am warm; I see
the fire."
17From the rest he makes a god, his
idol; he bows down to it and worships.
He prays to it and says, "Save me; you
are my god."
18They know nothing, they understand
nothing; their eyes are plastered over so
they cannot see, and their minds closed
so they cannot understand.
19No one stops to think, no one has the
knowledge or understanding to say,
"Half of it I used for fuel; I even baked
bread over its coals, I roasted meat and
I ate. Shall I make a detestable thing
from what is left? Shall I bow down to a
block of wood?"
20He feeds on ashes, a deluded heart
misleads him; he cannot save himself,
or say, "Is not this thing in my right hand
a lie?"
21"Remember these things, O Jacob, for
you are my servant, O Israel. I have
made you, you are my servant; O Israel,
I will not forget you.
22I have swept away your offenses like a
cloud, your sins like the morning mist.
Return to me, for I have redeemed you."
23Sing for joy, O heavens, for the Lord
has done this; shout aloud, O earth
beneath. Burst into song, you mountains,
you forests and all your trees, for the
Lord has redeemed Jacob, he displays
his glory in Israel.
24"This is what the Lord says- your
Redeemer, who formed you in the
womb: I am the Lord , who has made all
things, who alone stretched out the
heavens, who spread out the earth by
myself,
25who foils the signs of false prophets
and makes fools of diviners, who
overthrows the learning of the wise and
turns it into nonsense,
26who carries out the words of his
servants and fulfills the predictions of his
messengers, who says of Jerusalem, 'It
shall be inhabited,' of the towns of
Judah, 'They shall be built,' and of their
ruins, 'I will restore them,'
27who says to the watery deep, 'Be dry,
and I will dry up your streams,'
28who says of Cyrus, 'He is my shepherd
and will accomplish all that I please; he
will say of Jerusalem, "Let it be rebuilt,"
and of the temple, "Let its foundations
be laid." '
45"This is what the Lord says to his
anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I
take hold of to subdue nations before
him and to strip kings of their armor, to
open doors before him so that gates will
not be shut:
2I will go before you and will level the
mountains ; I will break down gates of
bronze and cut through bars of iron.
3I will give you the treasures of darkness,
riches stored in secret places, so that
you may know that I am the Lord , the
God of Israel, who summons you by
name.
4For the sake of Jacob my servant, of
Israel my chosen, I summon you by
name and bestow on you a title of honor,
though you do not acknowledge me.
5I am the Lord , and there is no other;
apart from me there is no God. I will
strengthen you, though you have not
acknowledged me,
6so that from the rising of the sun to the
place of its setting men may know there
is none besides me. I am the Lord , and
there is no other.
7I form the light and create darkness, I
bring prosperity and create disaster; I,
the Lord , do all these things.
8"You heavens above, rain down
righteousness; let the clouds shower it
down. Let the earth open wide, let
salvation spring up, let righteousness
grow with it; I, the Lord , have created it.
9"Woe to him who quarrels with his
Maker, to him who is but a potsherd
among the potsherds on the ground.
Does the clay say to the potter, 'What
are you making?' Does your work say,
'He has no hands'?
10Woe to him who says to his father,
'What have you begotten?' or to his
mother, 'What have you brought to
birth?'
11"This is what the Lord says- the Holy
One of Israel, and its Maker: Concerning
things to come, do you question me
about my children, or give me orders
about the work of my hands?
12It is I who made the earth and created
mankind upon it. My own hands
stretched out the heavens; I marshaled
their starry hosts.
13I will raise up Cyrus in my
righteousness: I will make all his ways
straight. He will rebuild my city and set
my exiles free, but not for a price or
reward, says the Lord Almighty."
14This is what the Lord says: "The
products of Egypt and the merchandise
of Cush, and those tall Sabeans- they
will come over to you and will be yours;
they will trudge behind you, coming over
to you in chains. They will bow down
before you and plead with you, saying,
'Surely God is with you, and there is no
other; there is no other god.' "
15Truly you are a God who hides himself,
O God and Savior of Israel.
16All the makers of idols will be put to
shame and disgraced; they will go off
into disgrace together.
17But Israel will be saved by the Lord
with an everlasting salvation; you will
never be put to shame or disgraced, to
ages everlasting.
18For this is what the Lord says- he who
created the heavens, he is God; he who
fashioned and made the earth, he
founded it; he did not create it to be
empty, but formed it to be inhabited- he
says: "I am the Lord , and there is no
other.
19I have not spoken in secret, from
somewhere in a land of darkness; I have
not said to Jacob's descendants, 'Seek
me in vain.' I, the Lord , speak the truth;
I declare what is right.
20"Gather together and come; assemble,
you fugitives from the nations. Ignorant
are those who carry about idols of wood,
who pray to gods that cannot save.
21Declare what is to be, present it- let
them take counsel together. Who
foretold this long ago, who declared it
from the distant past? Was it not I, the
Lord ? And there is no God apart from
me, a righteous God and a Savior; there
is none but me.
22"Turn to me and be saved, all you
ends of the earth; for I am God, and
there is no other.
23By myself I have sworn, my mouth has
uttered in all integrity a word that will not
be revoked: Before me every knee will
bow; by me every tongue will swear.
24They will say of me, 'In the Lord alone
are righteousness and strength.' " All
who have raged against him will come
to him and be put to shame.
25But in the Lord all the descendants of
Israel will be found righteous and will
exult.
46Bel bows down, Nebo stoops low;
their idols are borne by beasts of burden.
The images that are carried about are
burdensome, a burden for the weary.
2They stoop and bow down together;
unable to rescue the burden, they
themselves go off into captivity.
3"Listen to me, O house of Jacob, all
you who remain of the house of Israel,
you whom I have upheld since you were
conceived, and have carried since your
birth.
4Even to your old age and gray hairs I
am he, I am he who will sustain you. I
have made you and I will carry you; I will
sustain you and I will rescue you.
5"To whom will you compare me or
count me equal? To whom will you liken
me that we may be compared?
6Some pour out gold from their bags and
weigh out silver on the scales; they hire
a goldsmith to make it into a god, and
they bow down and worship it.
7They lift it to their shoulders and carry
it; they set it up in its place, and there it
stands. From that spot it cannot move.
Though one cries out to it, it does not
answer; it cannot save him from his
troubles.
8"Remember this, fix it in mind, take it to
heart, you rebels.
9Remember the former things, those of
long ago; I am God, and there is no
other; I am God, and there is none like
me.
10I make known the end from the
beginning, from ancient times, what is
still to come. I say: My purpose will
stand, and I will do all that I please.
11From the east I summon a bird of prey;
from a far-off land, a man to fulfill my
purpose. What I have said, that will I
bring about; what I have planned, that
will I do.
12Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted,
you who are far from righteousness.
13I am bringing my righteousness near, it
is not far away; and my salvation will not
be delayed. I will grant salvation to Zion,
my splendor to Israel.
47"Go down, sit in the dust, Virgin
Daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground
without a throne, Daughter of the
Babylonians. No more will you be called
tender or delicate.
2Take millstones and grind flour; take off
your veil. Lift up your skirts, bare your
legs, and wade through the streams.
3Your nakedness will be exposed and
your shame uncovered. I will take
vengeance; I will spare no one."
4Our Redeemer-the Lord Almighty is his
name- is the Holy One of Israel.
5"Sit in silence, go into darkness,
Daughter of the Babylonians; no more
will you be called queen of kingdoms.
6I was angry with my people and
desecrated my inheritance; I gave them
into your hand, and you showed them
no mercy. Even on the aged you laid a
very heavy yoke.
7You said, 'I will continue forever- the
eternal queen!' But you did not consider
these things or reflect on what might
happen.
8"Now then, listen, you wanton creature,
lounging in your security and saying to
yourself, 'I am, and there is none
besides me. I will never be a widow or
suffer the loss of children.'
9Both of these will overtake you in a
moment, on a single day: loss of
children and widowhood. They will come
upon you in full measure, in spite of your
many sorceries and all your potent
spells.
10You have trusted in your wickedness
and have said, 'No one sees me.' Your
wisdom and knowledge mislead you
when you say to yourself, 'I am, and
there is none besides me.'
11Disaster will come upon you, and you
will not know how to conjure it away. A
calamity will fall upon you that you
cannot ward off with a ransom; a
catastrophe you cannot foresee will
suddenly come upon you.
12"Keep on, then, with your magic spells
and with your many sorceries, which
you have labored at since childhood.
Perhaps you will succeed, perhaps you
will cause terror.
13All the counsel you have received has
only worn you out! Let your astrologers
come forward, those stargazers who
make predictions month by month, let
them save you from what is coming
upon you.
14Surely they are like stubble; the fire
will burn them up. They cannot even
save themselves from the power of the
flame. Here are no coals to warm
anyone; here is no fire to sit by.
15That is all they can do for you- these
you have labored with and trafficked
with since childhood. Each of them goes
on in his error; there is not one that can
save you.
48"Listen to this, O house of Jacob,
you who are called by the name of Israel
and come from the line of Judah, you
who take oaths in the name of the Lord
and invoke the God of Israel- but not in
truth or righteousness-
2you who call yourselves citizens of the
holy city and rely on the God of Israelthe
Lord Almighty is his name:
3I foretold the former things long ago,
my mouth announced them and I made
them known; then suddenly I acted, and
they came to pass.
4For I knew how stubborn you were; the
sinews of your neck were iron, your
forehead was bronze.
5Therefore I told you these things long
ago; before they happened I announced
them to you so that you could not say,
'My idols did them; my wooden image
and metal god ordained them.'
6You have heard these things; look at
them all. Will you not admit them? "From
now on I will tell you of new things, of
hidden things unknown to you.
7They are created now, and not long
ago; you have not heard of them before
today. So you cannot say, 'Yes, I knew
of them.'
8You have neither heard nor
understood; from of old your ear has not
been open. Well do I know how
treacherous you are; you were called a
rebel from birth.
9For my own name's sake I delay my
wrath; for the sake of my praise I hold it
back from you, so as not to cut you off.
10See, I have refined you, though not as
silver; I have tested you in the furnace of
affliction.
11For my own sake, for my own sake, I
do this. How can I let myself be
defamed? I will not yield my glory to
another.
12"Listen to me, O Jacob, Israel, whom I
have called: I am he; I am the first and I
am the last.
13My own hand laid the foundations of
the earth, and my right hand spread out
the heavens; when I summon them,
they all stand up together.
14"Come together, all of you, and listen:
Which of the idols has foretold these
things? The Lord 's chosen ally will carry
out his purpose against Babylon; his
arm will be against the Babylonians.
15I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have
called him. I will bring him, and he will
succeed in his mission.
16"Come near me and listen to this:
"From the first announcement I have not
spoken in secret; at the time it happens,
I am there." And now the Sovereign
Lord has sent me, with his Spirit.
17This is what the Lord says- your
Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: "I am
the Lord your God, who teaches you
what is best for you, who directs you in
the way you should go.
18If only you had paid attention to my
commands, your peace would have
been like a river, your righteousness like
the waves of the sea.
19Your descendants would have been
like the sand, your children like its
numberless grains; their name would
never be cut off nor destroyed from
before me."
20Leave Babylon, flee from the
Babylonians! Announce this with shouts
of joy and proclaim it. Send it out to the
ends of the earth; say, "The Lord has
redeemed his servant Jacob."
21They did not thirst when he led them
through the deserts; he made water flow
for them from the rock; he split the rock
and water gushed out.
22"There is no peace," says the Lord ,
"for the wicked."
49Listen to me, you islands; hear
this, you distant nations: Before I was
born the Lord called me; from my birth
he has made mention of my name.
2He made my mouth like a sharpened
sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid
me; he made me into a polished arrow
and concealed me in his quiver.
3He said to me, "You are my servant,
Israel, in whom I will display my
splendor."
4But I said, "I have labored to no
purpose; I have spent my strength in
vain and for nothing. Yet what is due me
is in the Lord 's hand, and my reward is
with my God."
5And now the Lord says- he who formed
me in the womb to be his servant to
bring Jacob back to him and gather
Israel to himself, for I am honored in the
eyes of the Lord and my God has been
my strength-
6he says: "It is too small a thing for you
to be my servant to restore the tribes of
Jacob and bring back those of Israel I
have kept. I will also make you a light for
the Gentiles, that you may bring my
salvation to the ends of the earth."
7This is what the Lord says- the
Redeemer and Holy One of Israel- to
him who was despised and abhorred by
the nation, to the servant of rulers:
"Kings will see you and rise up, princes
will see and bow down, because of the
Lord , who is faithful, the Holy One of
Israel, who has chosen you."
Restoration of Israel
8This is what the Lord says: "In the time
of my favor I will answer you, and in the
day of salvation I will help you; I will
keep you and will make you to be a
covenant for the people, to restore the
land and to reassign its desolate
inheritances,
9to say to the captives, 'Come out,' and
to those in darkness, 'Be free!' "They will
feed beside the roads and find pasture
on every barren hill.
10They will neither hunger nor thirst, nor
will the desert heat or the sun beat upon
them. He who has compassion on them
will guide them and lead them beside
springs of water.
11I will turn all my mountains into roads,
and my highways will be raised up.
12See, they will come from afar- some
from the north, some from the west,
some from the region of Aswan. "
13Shout for joy, O heavens; rejoice, O
earth; burst into song, O mountains! For
the Lord comforts his people and will
have compassion on his afflicted ones.
14But Zion said, "The Lord has forsaken
me, the Lord has forgotten me."
15"Can a mother forget the baby at her
breast and have no compassion on the
child she has borne? Though she may
forget, I will not forget you!
16See, I have engraved you on the
palms of my hands; your walls are ever
before me.
17Your sons hasten back, and those who
laid you waste depart from you.
18Lift up your eyes and look around; all
your sons gather and come to you. As
surely as I live," declares the Lord , "you
will wear them all as ornaments; you will
put them on, like a bride.
19"Though you were ruined and made
desolate and your land laid waste, now
you will be too small for your people,
and those who devoured you will be far
away.
20The children born during your
bereavement will yet say in your hearing,
'This place is too small for us; give us
more space to live in.'
21Then you will say in your heart, 'Who
bore me these? I was bereaved and
barren; I was exiled and rejected. Who
brought these up? I was left all alone,
but these-where have they come from?'
"
22This is what the Sovereign Lord says:
"See, I will beckon to the Gentiles, I will
lift up my banner to the peoples; they
will bring your sons in their arms and
carry your daughters on their shoulders.
23Kings will be your foster fathers, and
their queens your nursing mothers. They
will bow down before you with their
faces to the ground; they will lick the
dust at your feet. Then you will know
that I am the Lord ; those who hope in
me will not be disappointed."
24Can plunder be taken from warriors, or
captives rescued from the fierce ?
25But this is what the Lord says: "Yes,
captives will be taken from warriors, and
plunder retrieved from the fierce; I will
contend with those who contend with
you, and your children I will save.
26I will make your oppressors eat their
own flesh; they will be drunk on their
own blood, as with wine. Then all
mankind will know that I, the Lord , am
your Savior, your Redeemer, the Mighty
One of Jacob."
50This is what the Lord says:
"Where is your mother's certificate of
divorce with which I sent her away? Or
to which of my creditors did I sell you?
Because of your sins you were sold;
because of your transgressions your
mother was sent away.
2When I came, why was there no one?
When I called, why was there no one to
answer? Was my arm too short to
ransom you? Do I lack the strength to
rescue you? By a mere rebuke I dry up
the sea, I turn rivers into a desert; their
fish rot for lack of water and die of thirst.
3I clothe the sky with darkness and
make sackcloth its covering."
4The Sovereign Lord has given me an
instructed tongue, to know the word that
sustains the weary. He wakens me
morning by morning, wakens my ear to
listen like one being taught.
5The Sovereign Lord has opened my
ears, and I have not been rebellious; I
have not drawn back.
6I offered my back to those who beat me,
my cheeks to those who pulled out my
beard; I did not hide my face from
mocking and spitting.
7Because the Sovereign Lord helps me,
I will not be disgraced. Therefore have I
set my face like flint, and I know I will
not be put to shame.
8He who vindicates me is near. Who
then will bring charges against me? Let
us face each other! Who is my accuser?
Let him confront me!
9It is the Sovereign Lord who helps me.
Who is he that will condemn me? They
will all wear out like a garment; the
moths will eat them up.
10Who among you fears the Lord and
obeys the word of his servant? Let him
who walks in the dark, who has no light,
trust in the name of the Lord and rely on
his God.
11But now, all you who light fires and
provide yourselves with flaming torches,
go, walk in the light of your fires and of
the torches you have set ablaze. This is
what you shall receive from my hand:
You will lie down in torment.
51"Listen to me, you who pursue
righteousness and who seek the Lord :
Look to the rock from which you were
cut and to the quarry from which you
were hewn;
2look to Abraham, your father, and to
Sarah, who gave you birth. When I
called him he was but one, and I
blessed him and made him many.
3The Lord will surely comfort Zion and
will look with compassion on all her
ruins; he will make her deserts like Eden,
her wastelands like the garden of the
Lord . Joy and gladness will be found in
her, thanksgiving and the sound of
singing.
4"Listen to me, my people; hear me, my
nation: The law will go out from me; my
justice will become a light to the nations.
5My righteousness draws near speedily,
my salvation is on the way, and my arm
will bring justice to the nations. The
islands will look to me and wait in hope
for my arm.
6Lift up your eyes to the heavens, look
at the earth beneath; the heavens will
vanish like smoke, the earth will wear
out like a garment and its inhabitants die
like flies. But my salvation will last
forever, my righteousness will never fail.
7"Hear me, you who know what is right,
you people who have my law in your
hearts: Do not fear the reproach of men
or be terrified by their insults.
8For the moth will eat them up like a
garment; the worm will devour them like
wool. But my righteousness will last
forever, my salvation through all
generations."
9Awake, awake! Clothe yourself with
strength, O arm of the Lord ; awake, as
in days gone by, as in generations of old.
Was it not you who cut Rahab to pieces,
who pierced that monster through?
10Was it not you who dried up the sea,
the waters of the great deep, who made
a road in the depths of the sea so that
the redeemed might cross over?
11The ransomed of the Lord will return.
They will enter Zion with singing;
everlasting joy will crown their heads.
Gladness and joy will overtake them,
and sorrow and sighing will flee away.
12"I, even I, am he who comforts you.
Who are you that you fear mortal men,
the sons of men, who are but grass,
13that you forget the Lord your Maker,
who stretched out the heavens and laid
the foundations of the earth, that you
live in constant terror every day because
of the wrath of the oppressor, who is
bent on destruction? For where is the
wrath of the oppressor?
14The cowering prisoners will soon be
set free; they will not die in their
dungeon, nor will they lack bread.
15For I am the Lord your God, who
churns up the sea so that its waves
roar- the Lord Almighty is his name.
16I have put my words in your mouth and
covered you with the shadow of my
hand- I who set the heavens in place,
who laid the foundations of the earth,
and who say to Zion, 'You are my
people.' "
17Awake, awake! Rise up, O Jerusalem,
you who have drunk from the hand of
the Lord the cup of his wrath, you who
have drained to its dregs the goblet that
makes men stagger.
18Of all the sons she bore there was
none to guide her; of all the sons she
reared there was none to take her by
the hand.
19These double calamities have come
upon you- who can comfort you?- ruin
and destruction, famine and sword- who
can console you?
20Your sons have fainted; they lie at the
head of every street, like antelope
caught in a net. They are filled with the
wrath of the Lord and the rebuke of your
God.
21Therefore hear this, you afflicted one,
made drunk, but not with wine.
22This is what your Sovereign Lord says,
your God, who defends his people: "See,
I have taken out of your hand the cup
that made you stagger; from that cup,
the goblet of my wrath, you will never
drink again.
23I will put it into the hands of your
tormentors, who said to you, 'Fall
prostrate that we may walk over you.'
And you made your back like the ground,
like a street to be walked over."
52Awake, awake, O Zion, clothe
yourself with strength. Put on your
garments of splendor, O Jerusalem, the
holy city. The uncircumcised and defiled
will not enter you again.
2Shake off your dust; rise up, sit
enthroned, O Jerusalem. Free yourself
from the chains on your neck, O captive
Daughter of Zion.
3For this is what the Lord says: "You
were sold for nothing, and without
money you will be redeemed."
4For this is what the Sovereign Lord
says: "At first my people went down to
Egypt to live; lately, Assyria has
oppressed them.
5"And now what do I have here?"
declares the Lord . "For my people have
been taken away for nothing, and those
who rule them mock, " declares the
Lord . "And all day long my name is
constantly blasphemed.
6Therefore my people will know my
name; therefore in that day they will
know that it is I who foretold it. Yes, it is
I."
7How beautiful on the mountains are the
feet of those who bring good news, who
proclaim peace, who bring good tidings,
who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion,
"Your God reigns!"
8Listen! Your watchmen lift up their
voices; together they shout for joy.
When the Lord returns to Zion, they will
see it with their own eyes.
9Burst into songs of joy together, you
ruins of Jerusalem, for the Lord has
comforted his people, he has redeemed
Jerusalem.
10The Lord will lay bare his holy arm in
the sight of all the nations, and all the
ends of the earth will see the salvation
of our God.
11Depart, depart, go out from there!
Touch no unclean thing! Come out from
it and be pure, you who carry the
vessels of the Lord .
12But you will not leave in haste or go in
flight; for the Lord will go before you, the
God of Israel will be your rear guard.
13See, my servant will act wisely ; he will
be raised and lifted up and highly
exalted.
14Just as there were many who were
appalled at him - his appearance was so
disfigured beyond that of any man and
his form marred beyond human
likeness-
15so will he sprinkle many nations, and
kings will shut their mouths because of
him. For what they were not told, they
will see, and what they have not heard,
they will understand.
53Who has believed our message
and to whom has the arm of the Lord
been revealed?
2He grew up before him like a tender
shoot, and like a root out of dry ground.
He had no beauty or majesty to attract
us to him, nothing in his appearance
that we should desire him.
3He was despised and rejected by men,
a man of sorrows, and familiar with
suffering. Like one from whom men hide
their faces he was despised, and we
esteemed him not.
4Surely he took up our infirmities and
carried our sorrows, yet we considered
him stricken by God, smitten by him,
and afflicted.
5But he was pierced for our
transgressions, he was crushed for our
iniquities; the punishment that brought
us peace was upon him, and by his
wounds we are healed.
6We all, like sheep, have gone astray,
each of us has turned to his own way;
and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity
of us all.
7He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he
did not open his mouth; he was led like
a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep
before her shearers is silent, so he did
not open his mouth.
8By oppression and judgment he was
taken away. And who can speak of his
descendants? For he was cut off from
the land of the living; for the
transgression of my people he was
stricken.
9He was assigned a grave with the
wicked, and with the rich in his death,
though he had done no violence, nor
was any deceit in his mouth.
10Yet it was the Lord 's will to crush him
and cause him to suffer, and though the
Lord makes his life a guilt offering, he
will see his offspring and prolong his
days, and the will of the Lord will
prosper in his hand.
11After the suffering of his soul, he will
see the light of life and be satisfied ; by
his knowledge my righteous servant will
justify many, and he will bear their
iniquities.
12Therefore I will give him a portion
among the great, and he will divide the
spoils with the strong, because he
poured out his life unto death, and was
numbered with the transgressors. For
he bore the sin of many, and made
intercession for the transgressors.
54"Sing, O barren woman, you who
never bore a child; burst into song,
shout for joy, you who were never in
labor; because more are the children of
the desolate woman than of her who
has a husband," says the Lord .
2"Enlarge the place of your tent, stretch
your tent curtains wide, do not hold
back; lengthen your cords, strengthen
your stakes.
3For you will spread out to the right and
to the left; your descendants will
dispossess nations and settle in their
desolate cities.
4"Do not be afraid; you will not suffer
shame. Do not fear disgrace; you will
not be humiliated. You will forget the
shame of your youth and remember no
more the reproach of your widowhood.
5For your Maker is your husband- the
Lord Almighty is his name- the Holy One
of Israel is your Redeemer; he is called
the God of all the earth.
6The Lord will call you back as if you
were a wife deserted and distressed in
spirit- a wife who married young, only to
be rejected," says your God.
7"For a brief moment I abandoned you,
but with deep compassion I will bring
you back.
8In a surge of anger I hid my face from
you for a moment, but with everlasting
kindness I will have compassion on
you," says the Lord your Redeemer.
9"To me this is like the days of Noah,
when I swore that the waters of Noah
would never again cover the earth. So
now I have sworn not to be angry with
you, never to rebuke you again.
10Though the mountains be shaken and
the hills be removed, yet my unfailing
love for you will not be shaken nor my
covenant of peace be removed," says
the Lord , who has compassion on you.
11"O afflicted city, lashed by storms and
not comforted, I will build you with
stones of turquoise, your foundations
with sapphires.
12I will make your battlements of rubies,
your gates of sparkling jewels, and all
your walls of precious stones.
13All your sons will be taught by the
Lord , and great will be your children's
peace.
14In righteousness you will be
established: Tyranny will be far from
you; you will have nothing to fear. Terror
will be far removed; it will not come near
you.
15If anyone does attack you, it will not be
my doing; whoever attacks you will
surrender to you.
16"See, it is I who created the blacksmith
who fans the coals into flame and forges
a weapon fit for its work. And it is I who
have created the destroyer to work
havoc;
17no weapon forged against you will
prevail, and you will refute every tongue
that accuses you. This is the heritage of
the servants of the Lord , and this is
their vindication from me," declares the
Lord .
55"Come, all you who are thirsty,
come to the waters; and you who have
no money, come, buy and eat! Come,
buy wine and milk without money and
without cost.
2Why spend money on what is not bread,
and your labor on what does not satisfy?
Listen, listen to me, and eat what is
good, and your soul will delight in the
richest of fare.
3Give ear and come to me; hear me,
that your soul may live. I will make an
everlasting covenant with you, my
faithful love promised to David.
4See, I have made him a witness to the
peoples, a leader and commander of the
peoples.
5Surely you will summon nations you
know not, and nations that do not know
you will hasten to you, because of the
Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel,
for he has endowed you with splendor."
6Seek the Lord while he may be found;
call on him while he is near.
7Let the wicked forsake his way and the
evil man his thoughts. Let him turn to
the Lord , and he will have mercy on him,
and to our God, for he will freely pardon.
8"For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
neither are your ways my ways,"
declares the Lord .
9"As the heavens are higher than the
earth, so are my ways higher than your
ways and my thoughts than your
thoughts.
10As the rain and the snow come down
from heaven, and do not return to it
without watering the earth and making it
bud and flourish, so that it yields seed
for the sower and bread for the eater,
11so is my word that goes out from my
mouth: It will not return to me empty, but
will accomplish what I desire and
achieve the purpose for which I sent it.
12You will go out in joy and be led forth
in peace; the mountains and hills will
burst into song before you, and all the
trees of the field will clap their hands.
13Instead of the thornbush will grow the
pine tree, and instead of briers the
myrtle will grow. This will be for the Lord
's renown, for an everlasting sign, which
will not be destroyed."
56This is what the Lord says:
"Maintain justice and do what is right, for
my salvation is close at hand and my
righteousness will soon be revealed.
2Blessed is the man who does this, the
man who holds it fast, who keeps the
Sabbath without desecrating it, and
keeps his hand from doing any evil."
3Let no foreigner who has bound himself
to the Lord say, "The Lord will surely
exclude me from his people." And let not
any eunuch complain, "I am only a dry
tree."
4For this is what the Lord says: "To the
eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, who
choose what pleases me and hold fast
to my covenant-
5to them I will give within my temple and
its walls a memorial and a name better
than sons and daughters; I will give
them an everlasting name that will not
be cut off.
6And foreigners who bind themselves to
the Lord to serve him, to love the name
of the Lord , and to worship him, all who
keep the Sabbath without desecrating it
and who hold fast to my covenant-
7these I will bring to my holy mountain
and give them joy in my house of prayer.
Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will
be accepted on my altar; for my house
will be called a house of prayer for all
nations."
8The Sovereign Lord declares- he who
gathers the exiles of Israel: "I will gather
still others to them besides those
already gathered."
9Come, all you beasts of the field, come
and devour, all you beasts of the forest!
10Israel's watchmen are blind, they all
lack knowledge; they are all mute dogs,
they cannot bark; they lie around and
dream, they love to sleep.
11They are dogs with mighty appetites;
they never have enough. They are
shepherds who lack understanding; they
all turn to their own way, each seeks his
own gain.
12"Come," each one cries, "let me get
wine! Let us drink our fill of beer! And
tomorrow will be like today, or even far
better."
57The righteous perish, and no one
ponders it in his heart; devout men are
taken away, and no one understands
that the righteous are taken away to be
spared from evil.
2Those who walk uprightly enter into
peace; they find rest as they lie in death.
3"But you-come here, you sons of a
sorceress, you offspring of adulterers
and prostitutes!
4Whom are you mocking? At whom do
you sneer and stick out your tongue?
Are you not a brood of rebels, the
offspring of liars?
5You burn with lust among the oaks and
under every spreading tree; you
sacrifice your children in the ravines and
under the overhanging crags.
6The idols among the smooth stones of
the ravines are your portion; they, they
are your lot. Yes, to them you have
poured out drink offerings and offered
grain offerings. In the light of these
things, should I relent?
7You have made your bed on a high and
lofty hill; there you went up to offer your
sacrifices.
8Behind your doors and your doorposts
you have put your pagan symbols.
Forsaking me, you uncovered your bed,
you climbed into it and opened it wide;
you made a pact with those whose beds
you love, and you looked on their
nakedness.
9You went to Molech with olive oil and
increased your perfumes. You sent your
ambassadors far away; you descended
to the grave itself!
10You were wearied by all your ways,
but you would not say, 'It is hopeless.'
You found renewal of your strength, and
so you did not faint.
11"Whom have you so dreaded and
feared that you have been false to me,
and have neither remembered me nor
pondered this in your hearts? Is it not
because I have long been silent that you
do not fear me?
12I will expose your righteousness and
your works, and they will not benefit you.
13When you cry out for help, let your
collection of idols save you! The wind
will carry all of them off, a mere breath
will blow them away. But the man who
makes me his refuge will inherit the land
and possess my holy mountain."
14And it will be said: "Build up, build up,
prepare the road! Remove the obstacles
out of the way of my people."
15For this is what the high and lofty One
says- he who lives forever, whose name
is holy: "I live in a high and holy place,
but also with him who is contrite and
lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the
lowly and to revive the heart of the
contrite.
16I will not accuse forever, nor will I
always be angry, for then the spirit of
man would grow faint before me- the
breath of man that I have created.
17I was enraged by his sinful greed; I
punished him, and hid my face in anger,
yet he kept on in his willful ways.
18I have seen his ways, but I will heal
him; I will guide him and restore comfort
to him,
19creating praise on the lips of the
mourners in Israel. Peace, peace, to
those far and near," says the Lord . "And
I will heal them."
20But the wicked are like the tossing sea,
which cannot rest, whose waves cast up
mire and mud.
21"There is no peace," says my God, "for
the wicked."
58"Shout it aloud, do not hold back.
Raise your voice like a trumpet. Declare
to my people their rebellion and to the
house of Jacob their sins.
2For day after day they seek me out;
they seem eager to know my ways, as if
they were a nation that does what is
right and has not forsaken the
commands of its God. They ask me for
just decisions and seem eager for God
to come near them.
3'Why have we fasted,' they say, 'and
you have not seen it? Why have we
humbled ourselves, and you have not
noticed?' "Yet on the day of your fasting,
you do as you please and exploit all
your workers.
4Your fasting ends in quarreling and
strife, and in striking each other with
wicked fists. You cannot fast as you do
today and expect your voice to be heard
on high.
5Is this the kind of fast I have chosen,
only a day for a man to humble himself?
Is it only for bowing one's head like a
reed and for lying on sackcloth and
ashes? Is that what you call a fast, a
day acceptable to the Lord ?
6"Is not this the kind of fasting I have
chosen: to loose the chains of injustice
and untie the cords of the yoke, to set
the oppressed free and break every
yoke?
7Is it not to share your food with the
hungry and to provide the poor
wanderer with shelter- when you see the
naked, to clothe him, and not to turn
away from your own flesh and blood?
8Then your light will break forth like the
dawn, and your healing will quickly
appear; then your righteousness will go
before you, and the glory of the Lord will
be your rear guard.
9Then you will call, and the Lord will
answer; you will cry for help, and he will
say: Here am I. "If you do away with the
yoke of oppression, with the pointing
finger and malicious talk,
10and if you spend yourselves in behalf
of the hungry and satisfy the needs of
the oppressed, then your light will rise in
the darkness, and your night will
become like the noonday.
11The Lord will guide you always; he will
satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched
land and will strengthen your frame. You
will be like a well-watered garden, like a
spring whose waters never fail.
12Your people will rebuild the ancient
ruins and will raise up the age-old
foundations; you will be called Repairer
of Broken Walls, Restorer of Streets
with Dwellings.
13"If you keep your feet from breaking
the Sabbath and from doing as you
please on my holy day, if you call the
Sabbath a delight and the Lord 's holy
day honorable, and if you honor it by not
going your own way and not doing as
you please or speaking idle words,
14then you will find your joy in the Lord ,
and I will cause you to ride on the
heights of the land and to feast on the
inheritance of your father Jacob." The
mouth of the Lord has spoken.
59Surely the arm of the Lord is not
too short to save, nor his ear too dull to
hear.
2But your iniquities have separated you
from your God; your sins have hidden
his face from you, so that he will not
hear.
3For your hands are stained with blood,
your fingers with guilt. Your lips have
spoken lies, and your tongue mutters
wicked things.
4No one calls for justice; no one pleads
his case with integrity. They rely on
empty arguments and speak lies; they
conceive trouble and give birth to evil.
5They hatch the eggs of vipers and spin
a spider's web. Whoever eats their eggs
will die, and when one is broken, an
adder is hatched.
6Their cobwebs are useless for clothing;
they cannot cover themselves with what
they make. Their deeds are evil deeds,
and acts of violence are in their hands.
7Their feet rush into sin; they are swift to
shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are
evil thoughts; ruin and destruction mark
their ways.
8The way of peace they do not know;
there is no justice in their paths. They
have turned them into crooked roads; no
one who walks in them will know peace.
9So justice is far from us, and
righteousness does not reach us. We
look for light, but all is darkness; for
brightness, but we walk in deep
shadows.
10Like the blind we grope along the wall,
feeling our way like men without eyes.
At midday we stumble as if it were
twilight; among the strong, we are like
the dead.
11We all growl like bears; we moan
mournfully like doves. We look for
justice, but find none; for deliverance,
but it is far away.
12For our offenses are many in your
sight, and our sins testify against us.
Our offenses are ever with us, and we
acknowledge our iniquities:
13rebellion and treachery against the
Lord , turning our backs on our God,
fomenting oppression and revolt,
uttering lies our hearts have conceived.
14So justice is driven back, and
righteousness stands at a distance; truth
has stumbled in the streets, honesty
cannot enter.
15Truth is nowhere to be found, and
whoever shuns evil becomes a prey.
The Lord looked and was displeased
that there was no justice.
16He saw that there was no one, he was
appalled that there was no one to
intervene; so his own arm worked
salvation for him, and his own
righteousness sustained him.
17He put on righteousness as his
breastplate, and the helmet of salvation
on his head; he put on the garments of
vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal
as in a cloak.
18According to what they have done, so
will he repay wrath to his enemies and
retribution to his foes; he will repay the
islands their due.
19From the west, men will fear the name
of the Lord , and from the rising of the
sun, they will revere his glory. For he will
come like a pent-up flood that the breath
of the Lord drives along.
20"The Redeemer will come to Zion, to
those in Jacob who repent of their sins,"
declares the Lord .
21"As for me, this is my covenant with
them," says the Lord . "My Spirit, who is
on you, and my words that I have put in
your mouth will not depart from your
mouth, or from the mouths of your
children, or from the mouths of their
descendants from this time on and
forever," says the Lord .
60"Arise, shine, for your light has
come, and the glory of the Lord rises
upon you.
2See, darkness covers the earth and
thick darkness is over the peoples, but
the Lord rises upon you and his glory
appears over you.
3Nations will come to your light, and
kings to the brightness of your dawn.
4"Lift up your eyes and look about you:
All assemble and come to you; your
sons come from afar, and your
daughters are carried on the arm.
5Then you will look and be radiant, your
heart will throb and swell with joy; the
wealth on the seas will be brought to
you, to you the riches of the nations will
come.
6Herds of camels will cover your land,
young camels of Midian and Ephah. And
all from Sheba will come, bearing gold
and incense and proclaiming the praise
of the Lord .
7All Kedar's flocks will be gathered to
you, the rams of Nebaioth will serve
you; they will be accepted as offerings
on my altar, and I will adorn my glorious
temple.
8"Who are these that fly along like
clouds, like doves to their nests?
9Surely the islands look to me; in the
lead are the ships of Tarshish, bringing
your sons from afar, with their silver and
gold, to the honor of the Lord your God,
the Holy One of Israel, for he has
endowed you with splendor.
10"Foreigners will rebuild your walls, and
their kings will serve you. Though in
anger I struck you, in favor I will show
you compassion.
11Your gates will always stand open,
they will never be shut, day or night, so
that men may bring you the wealth of
the nations- their kings led in triumphal
procession.
12For the nation or kingdom that will not
serve you will perish; it will be utterly
ruined.
13"The glory of Lebanon will come to you,
the pine, the fir and the cypress together,
to adorn the place of my sanctuary; and
I will glorify the place of my feet.
14The sons of your oppressors will come
bowing before you; all who despise you
will bow down at your feet and will call
you the City of the Lord , Zion of the
Holy One of Israel.
15"Although you have been forsaken and
hated, with no one traveling through, I
will make you the everlasting pride and
the joy of all generations.
16You will drink the milk of nations and
be nursed at royal breasts. Then you will
know that I, the Lord , am your Savior,
your Redeemer, the Mighty One of
Jacob.
17Instead of bronze I will bring you gold,
and silver in place of iron. Instead of
wood I will bring you bronze, and iron in
place of stones. I will make peace your
governor and righteousness your ruler.
18No longer will violence be heard in
your land, nor ruin or destruction within
your borders, but you will call your walls
Salvation and your gates Praise.
19The sun will no more be your light by
day, nor will the brightness of the moon
shine on you, for the Lord will be your
everlasting light, and your God will be
your glory.
20Your sun will never set again, and your
moon will wane no more; the Lord will
be your everlasting light, and your days
of sorrow will end.
21Then will all your people be righteous
and they will possess the land forever.
They are the shoot I have planted, the
work of my hands, for the display of my
splendor.
22The least of you will become a
thousand, the smallest a mighty nation. I
am the Lord ; in its time I will do this
swiftly."
61The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is
on me, because the Lord has anointed
me to preach good news to the poor. He
has sent me to bind up the
brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for
the captives and release from darkness
for the prisoners,
2to proclaim the year of the Lord 's favor
and the day of vengeance of our God, to
comfort all who mourn,
3and provide for those who grieve in
Zion- to bestow on them a crown of
beauty instead of ashes, the oil of
gladness instead of mourning, and a
garment of praise instead of a spirit of
despair. They will be called oaks of
righteousness, a planting of the Lord for
the display of his splendor.
4They will rebuild the ancient ruins and
restore the places long devastated; they
will renew the ruined cities that have
been devastated for generations.
5Aliens will shepherd your flocks;
foreigners will work your fields and
vineyards.
6And you will be called priests of the
Lord , you will be named ministers of our
God. You will feed on the wealth of
nations, and in their riches you will boast.
7Instead of their shame my people will
receive a double portion, and instead of
disgrace they will rejoice in their
inheritance; and so they will inherit a
double portion in their land, and
everlasting joy will be theirs.
8"For I, the Lord , love justice; I hate
robbery and iniquity. In my faithfulness I
will reward them and make an
everlasting covenant with them.
9Their descendants will be known
among the nations and their offspring
among the peoples. All who see them
will acknowledge that they are a people
the Lord has blessed."
10I delight greatly in the Lord ; my soul
rejoices in my God. For he has clothed
me with garments of salvation and
arrayed me in a robe of righteousness,
as a bridegroom adorns his head like a
priest, and as a bride adorns herself
with her jewels.
11For as the soil makes the sprout come
up and a garden causes seeds to grow,
so the Sovereign Lord will make
righteousness and praise spring up
before all nations.
62For Zion's sake I will not keep
silent, for Jerusalem's sake I will not
remain quiet, till her righteousness
shines out like the dawn, her salvation
like a blazing torch.
2The nations will see your righteousness,
and all kings your glory; you will be
called by a new name that the mouth of
the Lord will bestow.
3You will be a crown of splendor in the
Lord 's hand, a royal diadem in the hand
of your God.
4No longer will they call you Deserted, or
name your land Desolate. But you will
be called Hephzibah, and your land
Beulah ; for the Lord will take delight in
you, and your land will be married.
5As a young man marries a maiden, so
will your sons marry you; as a
bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so
will your God rejoice over you.
6I have posted watchmen on your walls,
O Jerusalem; they will never be silent
day or night. You who call on the Lord ,
give yourselves no rest,
7and give him no rest till he establishes
Jerusalem and makes her the praise of
the earth.
8The Lord has sworn by his right hand
and by his mighty arm: "Never again will
I give your grain as food for your
enemies, and never again will foreigners
drink the new wine for which you have
toiled;
9but those who harvest it will eat it and
praise the Lord , and those who gather
the grapes will drink it in the courts of
my sanctuary."
10Pass through, pass through the gates!
Prepare the way for the people. Build up,
build up the highway! Remove the
stones. Raise a banner for the nations.
11The Lord has made proclamation to
the ends of the earth: "Say to the
Daughter of Zion, 'See, your Savior
comes! See, his reward is with him, and
his recompense accompanies him.' "
12They will be called the Holy People,
the Redeemed of the Lord ; and you will
be called Sought After, the City No
Longer Deserted.
63Who is this coming from Edom,
from Bozrah, with his garments stained
crimson? Who is this, robed in splendor,
striding forward in the greatness of his
strength? "It is I, speaking in
righteousness, mighty to save."
2Why are your garments red, like those
of one treading the winepress?
3"I have trodden the winepress alone;
from the nations no one was with me. I
trampled them in my anger and trod
them down in my wrath; their blood
spattered my garments, and I stained all
my clothing.
4For the day of vengeance was in my
heart, and the year of my redemption
has come.
5I looked, but there was no one to help, I
was appalled that no one gave support;
so my own arm worked salvation for me,
and my own wrath sustained me.
6I trampled the nations in my anger; in
my wrath I made them drunk and
poured their blood on the ground."
7I will tell of the kindnesses of the Lord ,
the deeds for which he is to be praised,
according to all the Lord has done for
us- yes, the many good things he has
done for the house of Israel, according
to his compassion and many kindnesses.
8He said, "Surely they are my people,
sons who will not be false to me"; and
so he became their Savior.
9In all their distress he too was
distressed, and the angel of his
presence saved them. In his love and
mercy he redeemed them; he lifted them
up and carried them all the days of old.
10Yet they rebelled and grieved his Holy
Spirit. So he turned and became their
enemy and he himself fought against
them.
11Then his people recalled the days of
old, the days of Moses and his peoplewhere
is he who brought them through
the sea, with the shepherd of his flock?
Where is he who set his Holy Spirit
among them,
12who sent his glorious arm of power to
be at Moses' right hand, who divided the
waters before them, to gain for himself
everlasting renown,
13who led them through the depths? Like
a horse in open country, they did not
stumble;
14like cattle that go down to the plain,
they were given rest by the Spirit of the
Lord . This is how you guided your
people to make for yourself a glorious
name.
15Look down from heaven and see from
your lofty throne, holy and glorious.
Where are your zeal and your might?
Your tenderness and compassion are
withheld from us.
16But you are our Father, though
Abraham does not know us or Israel
acknowledge us; you, O Lord , are our
Father, our Redeemer from of old is
your name.
17Why, O Lord , do you make us wander
from your ways and harden our hearts
so we do not revere you? Return for the
sake of your servants, the tribes that are
your inheritance.
18For a little while your people
possessed your holy place, but now our
enemies have trampled down your
sanctuary.
19We are yours from of old; but you have
not ruled over them, they have not been
called by your name.
64Oh, that you would rend the
heavens and come down, that the
mountains would tremble before you!
2As when fire sets twigs ablaze and
causes water to boil, come down to
make your name known to your
enemies and cause the nations to quake
before you!
3For when you did awesome things that
we did not expect, you came down, and
the mountains trembled before you.
4Since ancient times no one has heard,
no ear has perceived, no eye has seen
any God besides you, who acts on
behalf of those who wait for him.
5You come to the help of those who
gladly do right, who remember your
ways. But when we continued to sin
against them, you were angry. How then
can we be saved?
6All of us have become like one who is
unclean, and all our righteous acts are
like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a
leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us
away.
7No one calls on your name or strives to
lay hold of you; for you have hidden
your face from us and made us waste
away because of our sins.
8Yet, O Lord , you are our Father. We
are the clay, you are the potter; we are
all the work of your hand.
9Do not be angry beyond measure, O
Lord ; do not remember our sins forever.
Oh, look upon us, we pray, for we are all
your people.
10Your sacred cities have become a
desert; even Zion is a desert, Jerusalem
a desolation.
11Our holy and glorious temple, where
our fathers praised you, has been
burned with fire, and all that we
treasured lies in ruins.
12After all this, O Lord , will you hold
yourself back? Will you keep silent and
punish us beyond measure?
65"I revealed myself to those who
did not ask for me; I was found by those
who did not seek me. To a nation that
did not call on my name, I said, 'Here
am I, here am I.'
2All day long I have held out my hands
to an obstinate people, who walk in
ways not good, pursuing their own
imaginations-
3a people who continually provoke me to
my very face, offering sacrifices in
gardens and burning incense on altars
of brick;
4who sit among the graves and spend
their nights keeping secret vigil; who eat
the flesh of pigs, and whose pots hold
broth of unclean meat;
5who say, 'Keep away; don't come near
me, for I am too sacred for you!' Such
people are smoke in my nostrils, a fire
that keeps burning all day.
6"See, it stands written before me: I will
not keep silent but will pay back in full; I
will pay it back into their laps-
7both your sins and the sins of your
fathers," says the Lord . "Because they
burned sacrifices on the mountains and
defied me on the hills, I will measure
into their laps the full payment for their
former deeds."
8This is what the Lord says: "As when
juice is still found in a cluster of grapes
and men say, 'Don't destroy it, there is
yet some good in it,' so will I do in behalf
of my servants; I will not destroy them
all.
9I will bring forth descendants from
Jacob, and from Judah those who will
possess my mountains; my chosen
people will inherit them, and there will
my servants live.
10Sharon will become a pasture for
flocks, and the Valley of Achor a resting
place for herds, for my people who seek
me.
11"But as for you who forsake the Lord
and forget my holy mountain, who
spread a table for Fortune and fill bowls
of mixed wine for Destiny,
12I will destine you for the sword, and
you will all bend down for the slaughter;
for I called but you did not answer, I
spoke but you did not listen. You did evil
in my sight and chose what displeases
me."
13Therefore this is what the Sovereign
Lord says: "My servants will eat, but you
will go hungry; my servants will drink,
but you will go thirsty; my servants will
rejoice, but you will be put to shame.
14My servants will sing out of the joy of
their hearts, but you will cry out from
anguish of heart and wail in brokenness
of spirit.
15You will leave your name to my
chosen ones as a curse; the Sovereign
Lord will put you to death, but to his
servants he will give another name.
16Whoever invokes a blessing in the
land will do so by the God of truth; he
who takes an oath in the land will swear
by the God of truth. For the past
troubles will be forgotten and hidden
from my eyes.
17"Behold, I will create new heavens and
a new earth. The former things will not
be remembered, nor will they come to
mind.
18But be glad and rejoice forever in what
I will create, for I will create Jerusalem
to be a delight and its people a joy.
19I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take
delight in my people; the sound of
weeping and of crying will be heard in it
no more.
20"Never again will there be in it an
infant who lives but a few days, or an
old man who does not live out his years;
he who dies at a hundred will be thought
a mere youth; he who fails to reach a
hundred will be considered accursed.
21They will build houses and dwell in
them; they will plant vineyards and eat
their fruit.
22No longer will they build houses and
others live in them, or plant and others
eat. For as the days of a tree, so will be
the days of my people; my chosen ones
will long enjoy the works of their hands.
23They will not toil in vain or bear
children doomed to misfortune; for they
will be a people blessed by the Lord ,
they and their descendants with them.
24Before they call I will answer; while
they are still speaking I will hear.
25The wolf and the lamb will feed
together, and the lion will eat straw like
the ox, but dust will be the serpent's
food. They will neither harm nor destroy
on all my holy mountain," says the Lord .
66This is what the Lord says:
"Heaven is my throne, and the earth is
my footstool. Where is the house you
will build for me? Where will my resting
place be?
2Has not my hand made all these things,
and so they came into being?" declares
the Lord . "This is the one I esteem: he
who is humble and contrite in spirit, and
trembles at my word.
3But whoever sacrifices a bull is like one
who kills a man, and whoever offers a
lamb, like one who breaks a dog's neck;
whoever makes a grain offering is like
one who presents pig's blood, and
whoever burns memorial incense, like
one who worships an idol. They have
chosen their own ways, and their souls
delight in their abominations;
4so I also will choose harsh treatment for
them and will bring upon them what they
dread. For when I called, no one
answered, when I spoke, no one
listened. They did evil in my sight and
chose what displeases me."
5Hear the word of the Lord , you who
tremble at his word: "Your brothers who
hate you, and exclude you because of
my name, have said, 'Let the Lord be
glorified, that we may see your joy!' Yet
they will be put to shame.
6Hear that uproar from the city, hear that
noise from the temple! It is the sound of
the Lord repaying his enemies all they
deserve.
7"Before she goes into labor, she gives
birth; before the pains come upon her,
she delivers a son.
8Who has ever heard of such a thing?
Who has ever seen such things? Can a
country be born in a day or a nation be
brought forth in a moment? Yet no
sooner is Zion in labor than she gives
birth to her children.
9Do I bring to the moment of birth and
not give delivery?" says the Lord . "Do I
close up the womb when I bring to
delivery?" says your God.
10"Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad
for her, all you who love her; rejoice
greatly with her, all you who mourn over
her.
11For you will nurse and be satisfied at
her comforting breasts; you will drink
deeply and delight in her overflowing
abundance."
12For this is what the Lord says: "I will
extend peace to her like a river, and the
wealth of nations like a flooding stream;
you will nurse and be carried on her arm
and dandled on her knees.
13As a mother comforts her child, so will
I comfort you; and you will be comforted
over Jerusalem."
14When you see this, your heart will
rejoice and you will flourish like grass;
the hand of the Lord will be made known
to his servants, but his fury will be
shown to his foes.
15See, the Lord is coming with fire, and
his chariots are like a whirlwind; he will
bring down his anger with fury, and his
rebuke with flames of fire.
16For with fire and with his sword the
Lord will execute judgment upon all men,
and many will be those slain by the
Lord .
17"Those who consecrate and purify
themselves to go into the gardens,
following the one in the midst of those
who eat the flesh of pigs and rats and
other abominable things-they will meet
their end together," declares the Lord .
18"And I, because of their actions and
their imaginations, am about to come
and gather all nations and tongues, and
they will come and see my glory.
19"I will set a sign among them, and I will
send some of those who survive to the
nations-to Tarshish, to the Libyans and
Lydians (famous as archers), to Tubal
and Greece, and to the distant islands
that have not heard of my fame or seen
my glory. They will proclaim my glory
among the nations.
20And they will bring all your brothers,
from all the nations, to my holy mountain
in Jerusalem as an offering to the Lord -
on horses, in chariots and wagons, and
on mules and camels," says the Lord .
"They will bring them, as the Israelites
bring their grain offerings, to the temple
of the Lord in ceremonially clean
vessels.
21And I will select some of them also to
be priests and Levites," says the Lord .
22"As the new heavens and the new
earth that I make will endure before me,"
declares the Lord , "so will your name
and descendants endure.
23From one New Moon to another and
from one Sabbath to another, all
mankind will come and bow down
before me," says the Lord .
24"And they will go out and look upon the
dead bodies of those who rebelled
against me; their worm will not die, nor
will their fire be quenched, and they will
be loathsome to all mankind."
Jeremiah
1The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah,
one of the priests at Anathoth in the
territory of Benjamin.
2The word of the Lord came to him in
the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah
son of Amon king of Judah,
3and through the reign of Jehoiakim son
of Josiah king of Judah, down to the fifth
month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah
son of Josiah king of Judah, when the
people of Jerusalem went into exile.
4The word of the Lord came to me,
saying,
5"Before I formed you in the womb I
knew you, before you were born I set
you apart; I appointed you as a prophet
to the nations."
6"Ah, Sovereign Lord ," I said, "I do not
know how to speak; I am only a child."
7But the Lord said to me, "Do not say, 'I
am only a child.' You must go to
everyone I send you to and say
whatever I command you.
8Do not be afraid of them, for I am with
you and will rescue you," declares the
Lord .
9Then the Lord reached out his hand
and touched my mouth and said to me,
"Now, I have put my words in your
mouth.
10See, today I appoint you over nations
and kingdoms to uproot and tear down,
to destroy and overthrow, to build and to
plant."
11The word of the Lord came to me:
"What do you see, Jeremiah?" "I see the
branch of an almond tree," I replied.
12The Lord said to me, "You have seen
correctly, for I am watching to see that
my word is fulfilled."
13The word of the Lord came to me
again: "What do you see?" "I see a
boiling pot, tilting away from the north," I
answered.
14The Lord said to me, "From the north
disaster will be poured out on all who
live in the land.
15I am about to summon all the peoples
of the northern kingdoms," declares the
Lord . "Their kings will come and set up
their thrones in the entrance of the gates
of Jerusalem; they will come against all
her surrounding walls and against all the
towns of Judah.
16I will pronounce my judgments on my
people because of their wickedness in
forsaking me, in burning incense to
other gods and in worshiping what their
hands have made.
17"Get yourself ready! Stand up and say
to them whatever I command you. Do
not be terrified by them, or I will terrify
you before them.
18Today I have made you a fortified city,
an iron pillar and a bronze wall to stand
against the whole land-against the kings
of Judah, its officials, its priests and the
people of the land.
19They will fight against you but will not
overcome you, for I am with you and will
rescue you," declares the Lord .
2The word of the Lord came to me:
2"Go and proclaim in the hearing of
Jerusalem: " 'I remember the devotion of
your youth, how as a bride you loved me
and followed me through the desert,
through a land not sown.
3Israel was holy to the Lord , the
firstfruits of his harvest; all who
devoured her were held guilty, and
disaster overtook them,' " declares the
Lord .
4Hear the word of the Lord , O house of
Jacob, all you clans of the house of
Israel.
5This is what the Lord says: "What fault
did your fathers find in me, that they
strayed so far from me? They followed
worthless idols and became worthless
themselves.
6They did not ask, 'Where is the Lord ,
who brought us up out of Egypt and led
us through the barren wilderness,
through a land of deserts and rifts, a
land of drought and darkness, a land
where no one travels and no one lives?'
7I brought you into a fertile land to eat its
fruit and rich produce. But you came
and defiled my land and made my
inheritance detestable.
8The priests did not ask, 'Where is the
Lord ?' Those who deal with the law did
not know me; the leaders rebelled
against me. The prophets prophesied by
Baal, following worthless idols.
9"Therefore I bring charges against you
again," declares the Lord . "And I will
bring charges against your children's
children.
10Cross over to the coasts of Kittim and
look, send to Kedar and observe
closely; see if there has ever been
anything like this:
11Has a nation ever changed its gods?
(Yet they are not gods at all.) But my
people have exchanged their Glory for
worthless idols.
12Be appalled at this, O heavens, and
shudder with great horror," declares the
Lord .
13"My people have committed two sins:
They have forsaken me, the spring of
living water, and have dug their own
cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot
hold water.
14Is Israel a servant, a slave by birth?
Why then has he become plunder?
15Lions have roared; they have growled
at him. They have laid waste his land;
his towns are burned and deserted.
16Also, the men of Memphis and
Tahpanhes have shaved the crown of
your head.
17Have you not brought this on
yourselves by forsaking the Lord your
God when he led you in the way?
18Now why go to Egypt to drink water
from the Shihor ? And why go to Assyria
to drink water from the River ?
19Your wickedness will punish you; your
backsliding will rebuke you. Consider
then and realize how evil and bitter it is
for you when you forsake the Lord your
God and have no awe of me," declares
the Lord, the Lord Almighty.
20"Long ago you broke off your yoke and
tore off your bonds; you said, 'I will not
serve you!' Indeed, on every high hill
and under every spreading tree you lay
down as a prostitute.
21I had planted you like a choice vine of
sound and reliable stock. How then did
you turn against me into a corrupt, wild
vine?
22Although you wash yourself with soda
and use an abundance of soap, the
stain of your guilt is still before me,"
declares the Sovereign Lord .
23"How can you say, 'I am not defiled; I
have not run after the Baals'? See how
you behaved in the valley; consider
what you have done. You are a swift
she-camel running here and there,
24a wild donkey accustomed to the
desert, sniffing the wind in her cravingin
her heat who can restrain her? Any
males that pursue her need not tire
themselves; at mating time they will find
her.
25Do not run until your feet are bare and
your throat is dry. But you said, 'It's no
use! I love foreign gods, and I must go
after them.'
26"As a thief is disgraced when he is
caught, so the house of Israel is
disgraced- they, their kings and their
officials, their priests and their prophets.
27They say to wood, 'You are my father,'
and to stone, 'You gave me birth.' They
have turned their backs to me and not
their faces; yet when they are in trouble,
they say, 'Come and save us!'
28Where then are the gods you made for
yourselves? Let them come if they can
save you when you are in trouble! For
you have as many gods as you have
towns, O Judah.
29"Why do you bring charges against
me? You have all rebelled against me,"
declares the Lord .
30"In vain I punished your people; they
did not respond to correction. Your
sword has devoured your prophets like
a ravening lion.
31"You of this generation, consider the
word of the Lord : "Have I been a desert
to Israel or a land of great darkness?
Why do my people say, 'We are free to
roam; we will come to you no more'?
32Does a maiden forget her jewelry, a
bride her wedding ornaments? Yet my
people have forgotten me, days without
number.
33How skilled you are at pursuing love!
Even the worst of women can learn from
your ways.
34On your clothes men find the lifeblood
of the innocent poor, though you did not
catch them breaking in. Yet in spite of all
this
35you say, 'I am innocent; he is not
angry with me.' But I will pass judgment
on you because you say, 'I have not
sinned.'
36Why do you go about so much,
changing your ways? You will be
disappointed by Egypt as you were by
Assyria.
37You will also leave that place with your
hands on your head, for the Lord has
rejected those you trust; you will not be
helped by them.
3"If a man divorces his wife and she
leaves him and marries another man,
should he return to her again? Would
not the land be completely defiled? But
you have lived as a prostitute with many
lovers- would you now return to me?"
declares the Lord .
2"Look up to the barren heights and see.
Is there any place where you have not
been ravished? By the roadside you sat
waiting for lovers, sat like a nomad in
the desert. You have defiled the land
with your prostitution and wickedness.
3Therefore the showers have been
withheld, and no spring rains have fallen.
Yet you have the brazen look of a
prostitute; you refuse to blush with
shame.
4Have you not just called to me: 'My
Father, my friend from my youth,
5will you always be angry? Will your
wrath continue forever?' This is how you
talk, but you do all the evil you can."
6During the reign of King Josiah, the
Lord said to me, "Have you seen what
faithless Israel has done? She has gone
up on every high hill and under every
spreading tree and has committed
adultery there.
7I thought that after she had done all this
she would return to me but she did not,
and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it.
8I gave faithless Israel her certificate of
divorce and sent her away because of
all her adulteries. Yet I saw that her
unfaithful sister Judah had no fear; she
also went out and committed adultery.
9Because Israel's immorality mattered
so little to her, she defiled the land and
committed adultery with stone and wood.
10In spite of all this, her unfaithful sister
Judah did not return to me with all her
heart, but only in pretense," declares the
Lord .
11The Lord said to me, "Faithless Israel
is more righteous than unfaithful Judah.
12Go, proclaim this message toward the
north: " 'Return, faithless Israel,'
declares the Lord , 'I will frown on you
no longer, for I am merciful,' declares
the Lord , 'I will not be angry forever.
13Only acknowledge your guilt- you have
rebelled against the Lord your God, you
have scattered your favors to foreign
gods under every spreading tree, and
have not obeyed me,' " declares the
Lord .
14"Return, faithless people," declares the
Lord , "for I am your husband. I will
choose you-one from a town and two
from a clan-and bring you to Zion.
15Then I will give you shepherds after
my own heart, who will lead you with
knowledge and understanding.
16In those days, when your numbers
have increased greatly in the land,"
declares the Lord , "men will no longer
say, 'The ark of the covenant of the
Lord .' It will never enter their minds or
be remembered; it will not be missed,
nor will another one be made.
17At that time they will call Jerusalem
The Throne of the Lord , and all nations
will gather in Jerusalem to honor the
name of the Lord . No longer will they
follow the stubbornness of their evil
hearts.
18In those days the house of Judah will
join the house of Israel, and together
they will come from a northern land to
the land I gave your forefathers as an
inheritance.
19"I myself said, " 'How gladly would I
treat you like sons and give you a
desirable land, the most beautiful
inheritance of any nation.' I thought you
would call me 'Father' and not turn away
from following me.
20But like a woman unfaithful to her
husband, so you have been unfaithful to
me, O house of Israel," declares the
Lord .
21A cry is heard on the barren heights,
the weeping and pleading of the people
of Israel, because they have perverted
their ways and have forgotten the Lord
their God.
22"Return, faithless people; I will cure
you of backsliding." "Yes, we will come
to you, for you are the Lord our God.
23Surely the idolatrous commotion on
the hills and mountains is a deception;
surely in the Lord our God is the
salvation of Israel.
24From our youth shameful gods have
consumed the fruits of our fathers' labortheir
flocks and herds, their sons and
daughters.
25Let us lie down in our shame, and let
our disgrace cover us. We have sinned
against the Lord our God, both we and
our fathers; from our youth till this day
we have not obeyed the Lord our God."
4"If you will return, O Israel, return to
me," declares the Lord . "If you put your
detestable idols out of my sight and no
longer go astray,
2and if in a truthful, just and righteous
way you swear, 'As surely as the Lord
lives,' then the nations will be blessed by
him and in him they will glory."
3This is what the Lord says to the men
of Judah and to Jerusalem: "Break up
your unplowed ground and do not sow
among thorns.
4Circumcise yourselves to the Lord ,
circumcise your hearts, you men of
Judah and people of Jerusalem, or my
wrath will break out and burn like fire
because of the evil you have done- burn
with no one to quench it.
5"Announce in Judah and proclaim in
Jerusalem and say: 'Sound the trumpet
throughout the land!' Cry aloud and say:
'Gather together! Let us flee to the
fortified cities!'
6Raise the signal to go to Zion! Flee for
safety without delay! For I am bringing
disaster from the north, even terrible
destruction."
7A lion has come out of his lair; a
destroyer of nations has set out. He has
left his place to lay waste your land.
Your towns will lie in ruins without
inhabitant.
8So put on sackcloth, lament and wail,
for the fierce anger of the Lord has not
turned away from us.
9"In that day," declares the Lord , "the
king and the officials will lose heart, the
priests will be horrified, and the prophets
will be appalled."
10Then I said, "Ah, Sovereign Lord , how
completely you have deceived this
people and Jerusalem by saying, 'You
will have peace,' when the sword is at
our throats."
11At that time this people and Jerusalem
will be told, "A scorching wind from the
barren heights in the desert blows
toward my people, but not to winnow or
cleanse;
12a wind too strong for that comes from
me. Now I pronounce my judgments
against them."
13Look! He advances like the clouds, his
chariots come like a whirlwind, his
horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to
us! We are ruined!
14O Jerusalem, wash the evil from your
heart and be saved. How long will you
harbor wicked thoughts?
15A voice is announcing from Dan,
proclaiming disaster from the hills of
Ephraim.
16"Tell this to the nations, proclaim it to
Jerusalem: 'A besieging army is coming
from a distant land, raising a war cry
against the cities of Judah.
17They surround her like men guarding a
field, because she has rebelled against
me,' " declares the Lord .
18"Your own conduct and actions have
brought this upon you. This is your
punishment. How bitter it is! How it
pierces to the heart!"
19Oh, my anguish, my anguish! I writhe
in pain. Oh, the agony of my heart! My
heart pounds within me, I cannot keep
silent. For I have heard the sound of the
trumpet; I have heard the battle cry.
20Disaster follows disaster; the whole
land lies in ruins. In an instant my tents
are destroyed, my shelter in a moment.
21How long must I see the battle
standard and hear the sound of the
trumpet?
22"My people are fools; they do not know
me. They are senseless children; they
have no understanding. They are skilled
in doing evil; they know not how to do
good."
23I looked at the earth, and it was
formless and empty; and at the heavens,
and their light was gone.
24I looked at the mountains, and they
were quaking; all the hills were swaying.
25I looked, and there were no people;
every bird in the sky had flown away.
26I looked, and the fruitful land was a
desert; all its towns lay in ruins before
the Lord , before his fierce anger.
27This is what the Lord says: "The whole
land will be ruined, though I will not
destroy it completely.
28Therefore the earth will mourn and the
heavens above grow dark, because I
have spoken and will not relent, I have
decided and will not turn back."
29At the sound of horsemen and archers
every town takes to flight. Some go into
the thickets; some climb up among the
rocks. All the towns are deserted; no
one lives in them.
30What are you doing, O devastated
one? Why dress yourself in scarlet and
put on jewels of gold? Why shade your
eyes with paint? You adorn yourself in
vain. Your lovers despise you; they seek
your life.
31I hear a cry as of a woman in labor, a
groan as of one bearing her first childthe
cry of the Daughter of Zion gasping
for breath, stretching out her hands and
saying, "Alas! I am fainting; my life is
given over to murderers."
5"Go up and down the streets of
Jerusalem, look around and consider,
search through her squares. If you can
find but one person who deals honestly
and seeks the truth, I will forgive this city.
2Although they say, 'As surely as the
Lord lives,' still they are swearing
falsely."
3O Lord , do not your eyes look for
truth? You struck them, but they felt no
pain; you crushed them, but they
refused correction. They made their
faces harder than stone and refused to
repent.
4I thought, "These are only the poor;
they are foolish, for they do not know
the way of the Lord , the requirements of
their God.
5So I will go to the leaders and speak to
them; surely they know the way of the
Lord , the requirements of their God."
But with one accord they too had broken
off the yoke and torn off the bonds.
6Therefore a lion from the forest will
attack them, a wolf from the desert will
ravage them, a leopard will lie in wait
near their towns to tear to pieces any
who venture out, for their rebellion is
great and their backslidings many.
7"Why should I forgive you? Your
children have forsaken me and sworn by
gods that are not gods. I supplied all
their needs, yet they committed adultery
and thronged to the houses of
prostitutes.
8They are well-fed, lusty stallions, each
neighing for another man's wife.
9Should I not punish them for this?"
declares the Lord . "Should I not avenge
myself on such a nation as this?
10"Go through her vineyards and ravage
them, but do not destroy them
completely. Strip off her branches, for
these people do not belong to the Lord .
11The house of Israel and the house of
Judah have been utterly unfaithful to
me," declares the Lord .
12They have lied about the Lord ; they
said, "He will do nothing! No harm will
come to us; we will never see sword or
famine.
13The prophets are but wind and the
word is not in them; so let what they say
be done to them."
14Therefore this is what the Lord God
Almighty says: "Because the people
have spoken these words, I will make
my words in your mouth a fire and these
people the wood it consumes.
15O house of Israel," declares the Lord ,
"I am bringing a distant nation against
you- an ancient and enduring nation, a
people whose language you do not
know, whose speech you do not
understand.
16Their quivers are like an open grave;
all of them are mighty warriors.
17They will devour your harvests and
food, devour your sons and daughters;
they will devour your flocks and herds,
devour your vines and fig trees. With the
sword they will destroy the fortified cities
in which you trust.
18"Yet even in those days," declares the
Lord , "I will not destroy you completely.
19And when the people ask, 'Why has
the Lord our God done all this to us?'
you will tell them, 'As you have forsaken
me and served foreign gods in your own
land, so now you will serve foreigners in
a land not your own.'
20"Announce this to the house of Jacob
and proclaim it in Judah:
21Hear this, you foolish and senseless
people, who have eyes but do not see,
who have ears but do not hear:
22Should you not fear me?" declares the
Lord . "Should you not tremble in my
presence? I made the sand a boundary
for the sea, an everlasting barrier it
cannot cross. The waves may roll, but
they cannot prevail; they may roar, but
they cannot cross it.
23But these people have stubborn and
rebellious hearts; they have turned
aside and gone away.
24They do not say to themselves, 'Let us
fear the Lord our God, who gives
autumn and spring rains in season, who
assures us of the regular weeks of
harvest.'
25Your wrongdoings have kept these
away; your sins have deprived you of
good.
26"Among my people are wicked men
who lie in wait like men who snare birds
and like those who set traps to catch
men.
27Like cages full of birds, their houses
are full of deceit; they have become rich
and powerful
28and have grown fat and sleek. Their
evil deeds have no limit; they do not
plead the case of the fatherless to win it,
they do not defend the rights of the poor.
29Should I not punish them for this?"
declares the Lord . "Should I not avenge
myself on such a nation as this?
30"A horrible and shocking thing has
happened in the land:
31The prophets prophesy lies, the priests
rule by their own authority, and my
people love it this way. But what will you
do in the end?
6"Flee for safety, people of Benjamin!
Flee from Jerusalem! Sound the trumpet
in Tekoa! Raise the signal over Beth
Hakkerem! For disaster looms out of the
north, even terrible destruction.
2I will destroy the Daughter of Zion, so
beautiful and delicate.
3Shepherds with their flocks will come
against her; they will pitch their tents
around her, each tending his own
portion."
4"Prepare for battle against her! Arise,
let us attack at noon! But, alas, the
daylight is fading, and the shadows of
evening grow long.
5So arise, let us attack at night and
destroy her fortresses!"
6This is what the Lord Almighty says:
"Cut down the trees and build siege
ramps against Jerusalem. This city must
be punished; it is filled with oppression.
7As a well pours out its water, so she
pours out her wickedness. Violence and
destruction resound in her; her sickness
and wounds are ever before me.
8Take warning, O Jerusalem, or I will
turn away from you and make your land
desolate so no one can live in it."
9This is what the Lord Almighty says:
"Let them glean the remnant of Israel as
thoroughly as a vine; pass your hand
over the branches again, like one
gathering grapes."
10To whom can I speak and give
warning? Who will listen to me? Their
ears are closed so they cannot hear.
The word of the Lord is offensive to
them; they find no pleasure in it.
11But I am full of the wrath of the Lord ,
and I cannot hold it in. "Pour it out on
the children in the street and on the
young men gathered together; both
husband and wife will be caught in it,
and the old, those weighed down with
years.
12Their houses will be turned over to
others, together with their fields and
their wives, when I stretch out my hand
against those who live in the land,"
declares the Lord .
13"From the least to the greatest, all are
greedy for gain; prophets and priests
alike, all practice deceit.
14They dress the wound of my people as
though it were not serious. 'Peace,
peace,' they say, when there is no
peace.
15Are they ashamed of their loathsome
conduct? No, they have no shame at all;
they do not even know how to blush. So
they will fall among the fallen; they will
be brought down when I punish them,"
says the Lord .
16This is what the Lord says: "Stand at
the crossroads and look; ask for the
ancient paths, ask where the good way
is, and walk in it, and you will find rest
for your souls. But you said, 'We will not
walk in it.'
17I appointed watchmen over you and
said, 'Listen to the sound of the trumpet!'
But you said, 'We will not listen.'
18Therefore hear, O nations; observe, O
witnesses, what will happen to them.
19Hear, O earth: I am bringing disaster
on this people, the fruit of their schemes,
because they have not listened to my
words and have rejected my law.
20What do I care about incense from
Sheba or sweet calamus from a distant
land? Your burnt offerings are not
acceptable; your sacrifices do not
please me."
21Therefore this is what the Lord says: "I
will put obstacles before this people.
Fathers and sons alike will stumble over
them; neighbors and friends will perish."
22This is what the Lord says: "Look, an
army is coming from the land of the
north; a great nation is being stirred up
from the ends of the earth.
23They are armed with bow and spear;
they are cruel and show no mercy. They
sound like the roaring sea as they ride
on their horses; they come like men in
battle formation to attack you, O
Daughter of Zion."
24We have heard reports about them,
and our hands hang limp. Anguish has
gripped us, pain like that of a woman in
labor.
25Do not go out to the fields or walk on
the roads, for the enemy has a sword,
and there is terror on every side.
26O my people, put on sackcloth and roll
in ashes; mourn with bitter wailing as for
an only son, for suddenly the destroyer
will come upon us.
27"I have made you a tester of metals
and my people the ore, that you may
observe and test their ways.
28They are all hardened rebels, going
about to slander. They are bronze and
iron; they all act corruptly.
29The bellows blow fiercely to burn away
the lead with fire, but the refining goes
on in vain; the wicked are not purged
out.
30They are called rejected silver,
because the Lord has rejected them."
7This is the word that came to
Jeremiah from the Lord :
2"Stand at the gate of the Lord 's house
and there proclaim this message: " 'Hear
the word of the Lord , all you people of
Judah who come through these gates to
worship the Lord .
3This is what the Lord Almighty, the God
of Israel, says: Reform your ways and
your actions, and I will let you live in this
place.
4Do not trust in deceptive words and say,
"This is the temple of the Lord , the
temple of the Lord , the temple of the
Lord !"
5If you really change your ways and your
actions and deal with each other justly,
6if you do not oppress the alien, the
fatherless or the widow and do not shed
innocent blood in this place, and if you
do not follow other gods to your own
harm,
7then I will let you live in this place, in
the land I gave your forefathers for ever
and ever.
8But look, you are trusting in deceptive
words that are worthless.
9" 'Will you steal and murder, commit
adultery and perjury, burn incense to
Baal and follow other gods you have not
known,
10and then come and stand before me in
this house, which bears my Name, and
say, "We are safe"-safe to do all these
detestable things?
11Has this house, which bears my Name,
become a den of robbers to you? But I
have been watching! declares the Lord .
12" 'Go now to the place in Shiloh where
I first made a dwelling for my Name, and
see what I did to it because of the
wickedness of my people Israel.
13While you were doing all these things,
declares the Lord , I spoke to you again
and again, but you did not listen; I called
you, but you did not answer.
14Therefore, what I did to Shiloh I will
now do to the house that bears my
Name, the temple you trust in, the place
I gave to you and your fathers.
15I will thrust you from my presence, just
as I did all your brothers, the people of
Ephraim.'
16"So do not pray for this people nor
offer any plea or petition for them; do
not plead with me, for I will not listen to
you.
17Do you not see what they are doing in
the towns of Judah and in the streets of
Jerusalem?
18The children gather wood, the fathers
light the fire, and the women knead the
dough and make cakes of bread for the
Queen of Heaven. They pour out drink
offerings to other gods to provoke me to
anger.
19But am I the one they are provoking?
declares the Lord . Are they not rather
harming themselves, to their own
shame?
20" 'Therefore this is what the Sovereign
Lord says: My anger and my wrath will
be poured out on this place, on man and
beast, on the trees of the field and on
the fruit of the ground, and it will burn
and not be quenched.
21" 'This is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: Go ahead, add your
burnt offerings to your other sacrifices
and eat the meat yourselves!
22For when I brought your forefathers
out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not
just give them commands about burnt
offerings and sacrifices,
23but I gave them this command: Obey
me, and I will be your God and you will
be my people. Walk in all the ways I
command you, that it may go well with
you.
24But they did not listen or pay attention;
instead, they followed the stubborn
inclinations of their evil hearts. They
went backward and not forward.
25From the time your forefathers left
Egypt until now, day after day, again
and again I sent you my servants the
prophets.
26But they did not listen to me or pay
attention. They were stiff-necked and
did more evil than their forefathers.'
27"When you tell them all this, they will
not listen to you; when you call to them,
they will not answer.
28Therefore say to them, 'This is the
nation that has not obeyed the Lord its
God or responded to correction. Truth
has perished; it has vanished from their
lips.
29Cut off your hair and throw it away;
take up a lament on the barren heights,
for the Lord has rejected and
abandoned this generation that is under
his wrath.
30" 'The people of Judah have done evil
in my eyes, declares the Lord . They
have set up their detestable idols in the
house that bears my Name and have
defiled it.
31They have built the high places of
Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to
burn their sons and daughters in the
fire-something I did not command, nor
did it enter my mind.
32So beware, the days are coming,
declares the Lord , when people will no
longer call it Topheth or the Valley of
Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter,
for they will bury the dead in Topheth
until there is no more room.
33Then the carcasses of this people will
become food for the birds of the air and
the beasts of the earth, and there will be
no one to frighten them away.
34I will bring an end to the sounds of joy
and gladness and to the voices of bride
and bridegroom in the towns of Judah
and the streets of Jerusalem, for the
land will become desolate.
8" 'At that time, declares the Lord , the
bones of the kings and officials of Judah,
the bones of the priests and prophets,
and the bones of the people of
Jerusalem will be removed from their
graves.
2They will be exposed to the sun and the
moon and all the stars of the heavens,
which they have loved and served and
which they have followed and consulted
and worshiped. They will not be
gathered up or buried, but will be like
refuse lying on the ground.
3Wherever I banish them, all the
survivors of this evil nation will prefer
death to life, declares the Lord
Almighty.'
4"Say to them, 'This is what the Lord
says: " 'When men fall down, do they not
get up? When a man turns away, does
he not return?
5Why then have these people turned
away? Why does Jerusalem always turn
away? They cling to deceit; they refuse
to return.
6I have listened attentively, but they do
not say what is right. No one repents of
his wickedness, saying, "What have I
done?" Each pursues his own course
like a horse charging into battle.
7Even the stork in the sky knows her
appointed seasons, and the dove, the
swift and the thrush observe the time of
their migration. But my people do not
know the requirements of the Lord .
8" 'How can you say, "We are wise, for
we have the law of the Lord ," when
actually the lying pen of the scribes has
handled it falsely?
9The wise will be put to shame; they will
be dismayed and trapped. Since they
have rejected the word of the Lord ,
what kind of wisdom do they have?
10Therefore I will give their wives to
other men and their fields to new
owners. From the least to the greatest,
all are greedy for gain; prophets and
priests alike, all practice deceit.
11They dress the wound of my people as
though it were not serious. "Peace,
peace," they say, when there is no
peace.
12Are they ashamed of their loathsome
conduct? No, they have no shame at all;
they do not even know how to blush. So
they will fall among the fallen; they will
be brought down when they are
punished, says the Lord .
13" 'I will take away their harvest,
declares the Lord . There will be no
grapes on the vine. There will be no figs
on the tree, and their leaves will wither.
What I have given them will be taken
from them. ' "
14"Why are we sitting here? Gather
together! Let us flee to the fortified cities
and perish there! For the Lord our God
has doomed us to perish and given us
poisoned water to drink, because we
have sinned against him.
15We hoped for peace but no good has
come, for a time of healing but there
was only terror.
16The snorting of the enemy's horses is
heard from Dan; at the neighing of their
stallions the whole land trembles. They
have come to devour the land and
everything in it, the city and all who live
there."
17"See, I will send venomous snakes
among you, vipers that cannot be
charmed, and they will bite you,"
declares the Lord .
18O my Comforter in sorrow, my heart is
faint within me.
19Listen to the cry of my people from a
land far away: "Is the Lord not in Zion?
Is her King no longer there?" "Why have
they provoked me to anger with their
images, with their worthless foreign
idols?"
20"The harvest is past, the summer has
ended, and we are not saved."
21Since my people are crushed, I am
crushed; I mourn, and horror grips me.
22Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no
physician there? Why then is there no
healing for the wound of my people?
9Oh, that my head were a spring of
water and my eyes a fountain of tears! I
would weep day and night for the slain
of my people.
2Oh, that I had in the desert a lodging
place for travelers, so that I might leave
my people and go away from them; for
they are all adulterers, a crowd of
unfaithful people.
3"They make ready their tongue like a
bow, to shoot lies; it is not by truth that
they triumph in the land. They go from
one sin to another; they do not
acknowledge me," declares the Lord .
4"Beware of your friends; do not trust
your brothers. For every brother is a
deceiver, and every friend a slanderer.
5Friend deceives friend, and no one
speaks the truth. They have taught their
tongues to lie; they weary themselves
with sinning.
6You live in the midst of deception; in
their deceit they refuse to acknowledge
me," declares the Lord .
7Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty
says: "See, I will refine and test them,
for what else can I do because of the sin
of my people?
8Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it
speaks with deceit. With his mouth each
speaks cordially to his neighbor, but in
his heart he sets a trap for him.
9Should I not punish them for this?"
declares the Lord . "Should I not avenge
myself on such a nation as this?"
10I will weep and wail for the mountains
and take up a lament concerning the
desert pastures. They are desolate and
untraveled, and the lowing of cattle is
not heard. The birds of the air have fled
and the animals are gone.
11"I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins,
a haunt of jackals; and I will lay waste
the towns of Judah so no one can live
there."
12What man is wise enough to
understand this? Who has been
instructed by the Lord and can explain
it? Why has the land been ruined and
laid waste like a desert that no one can
cross?
13The Lord said, "It is because they have
forsaken my law, which I set before
them; they have not obeyed me or
followed my law.
14Instead, they have followed the
stubbornness of their hearts; they have
followed the Baals, as their fathers
taught them."
15Therefore, this is what the Lord
Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "See, I
will make this people eat bitter food and
drink poisoned water.
16I will scatter them among nations that
neither they nor their fathers have
known, and I will pursue them with the
sword until I have destroyed them."
17This is what the Lord Almighty says:
"Consider now! Call for the wailing
women to come; send for the most
skillful of them.
18Let them come quickly and wail over
us till our eyes overflow with tears and
water streams from our eyelids.
19The sound of wailing is heard from
Zion: 'How ruined we are! How great is
our shame! We must leave our land
because our houses are in ruins.' "
20Now, O women, hear the word of the
Lord ; open your ears to the words of his
mouth. Teach your daughters how to
wail; teach one another a lament.
21Death has climbed in through our
windows and has entered our
fortresses; it has cut off the children
from the streets and the young men
from the public squares.
22Say, "This is what the Lord declares: "
'The dead bodies of men will lie like
refuse on the open field, like cut grain
behind the reaper, with no one to gather
them.' "
23This is what the Lord says: "Let not the
wise man boast of his wisdom or the
strong man boast of his strength or the
rich man boast of his riches,
24but let him who boasts boast about
this: that he understands and knows me,
that I am the Lord , who exercises
kindness, justice and righteousness on
earth, for in these I delight," declares the
Lord .
25"The days are coming," declares the
Lord , "when I will punish all who are
circumcised only in the flesh-
26Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab
and all who live in the desert in distant
places. For all these nations are really
uncircumcised, and even the whole
house of Israel is uncircumcised in
heart."
10Hear what the Lord says to you, O
house of Israel.
2This is what the Lord says: "Do not
learn the ways of the nations or be
terrified by signs in the sky, though the
nations are terrified by them.
3For the customs of the peoples are
worthless; they cut a tree out of the
forest, and a craftsman shapes it with
his chisel.
4They adorn it with silver and gold; they
fasten it with hammer and nails so it will
not totter.
5Like a scarecrow in a melon patch, their
idols cannot speak; they must be carried
because they cannot walk. Do not fear
them; they can do no harm nor can they
do any good."
6No one is like you, O Lord ; you are
great, and your name is mighty in power.
7Who should not revere you, O King of
the nations? This is your due. Among all
the wise men of the nations and in all
their kingdoms, there is no one like you.
8They are all senseless and foolish; they
are taught by worthless wooden idols.
9Hammered silver is brought from
Tarshish and gold from Uphaz. What the
craftsman and goldsmith have made is
then dressed in blue and purple- all
made by skilled workers.
10But the Lord is the true God; he is the
living God, the eternal King. When he is
angry, the earth trembles; the nations
cannot endure his wrath.
11"Tell them this: 'These gods, who did
not make the heavens and the earth, will
perish from the earth and from under the
heavens.' "
12But God made the earth by his power;
he founded the world by his wisdom and
stretched out the heavens by his
understanding.
13When he thunders, the waters in the
heavens roar; he makes clouds rise
from the ends of the earth. He sends
lightning with the rain and brings out the
wind from his storehouses.
14Everyone is senseless and without
knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed
by his idols. His images are a fraud;
they have no breath in them.
15They are worthless, the objects of
mockery; when their judgment comes,
they will perish.
16He who is the Portion of Jacob is not
like these, for he is the Maker of all
things, including Israel, the tribe of his
inheritance- the Lord Almighty is his
name.
17Gather up your belongings to leave the
land, you who live under siege.
18For this is what the Lord says: "At this
time I will hurl out those who live in this
land; I will bring distress on them so that
they may be captured."
19Woe to me because of my injury! My
wound is incurable! Yet I said to myself,
"This is my sickness, and I must endure
it."
20My tent is destroyed; all its ropes are
snapped. My sons are gone from me
and are no more; no one is left now to
pitch my tent or to set up my shelter.
21The shepherds are senseless and do
not inquire of the Lord ; so they do not
prosper and all their flock is scattered.
22Listen! The report is coming- a great
commotion from the land of the north! It
will make the towns of Judah desolate, a
haunt of jackals.
23I know, O Lord , that a man's life is not
his own; it is not for man to direct his
steps.
24Correct me, Lord , but only with
justice- not in your anger, lest you
reduce me to nothing.
25Pour out your wrath on the nations that
do not acknowledge you, on the peoples
who do not call on your name. For they
have devoured Jacob; they have
devoured him completely and destroyed
his homeland.
11This is the word that came to
Jeremiah from the Lord :
2"Listen to the terms of this covenant
and tell them to the people of Judah and
to those who live in Jerusalem.
3Tell them that this is what the Lord , the
God of Israel, says: 'Cursed is the man
who does not obey the terms of this
covenant4the
terms I commanded your
forefathers when I brought them out of
Egypt, out of the iron-smelting furnace.' I
said, 'Obey me and do everything I
command you, and you will be my
people, and I will be your God.
5Then I will fulfill the oath I swore to your
forefathers, to give them a land flowing
with milk and honey'-the land you
possess today." I answered, "Amen,
Lord ."
6The Lord said to me, "Proclaim all
these words in the towns of Judah and
in the streets of Jerusalem: 'Listen to the
terms of this covenant and follow them.
7From the time I brought your
forefathers up from Egypt until today, I
warned them again and again, saying,
"Obey me."
8But they did not listen or pay attention;
instead, they followed the stubbornness
of their evil hearts. So I brought on them
all the curses of the covenant I had
commanded them to follow but that they
did not keep.' "
9Then the Lord said to me, "There is a
conspiracy among the people of Judah
and those who live in Jerusalem.
10They have returned to the sins of their
forefathers, who refused to listen to my
words. They have followed other gods to
serve them. Both the house of Israel
and the house of Judah have broken the
covenant I made with their forefathers.
11Therefore this is what the Lord says: 'I
will bring on them a disaster they cannot
escape. Although they cry out to me, I
will not listen to them.
12The towns of Judah and the people of
Jerusalem will go and cry out to the
gods to whom they burn incense, but
they will not help them at all when
disaster strikes.
13You have as many gods as you have
towns, O Judah; and the altars you have
set up to burn incense to that shameful
god Baal are as many as the streets of
Jerusalem.'
14"Do not pray for this people nor offer
any plea or petition for them, because I
will not listen when they call to me in the
time of their distress.
15"What is my beloved doing in my
temple as she works out her evil
schemes with many? Can consecrated
meat avert your punishment ? When
you engage in your wickedness, then
you rejoice. "
16The Lord called you a thriving olive
tree with fruit beautiful in form. But with
the roar of a mighty storm he will set it
on fire, and its branches will be broken.
17The Lord Almighty, who planted you,
has decreed disaster for you, because
the house of Israel and the house of
Judah have done evil and provoked me
to anger by burning incense to Baal.
18Because the Lord revealed their plot to
me, I knew it, for at that time he showed
me what they were doing.
19I had been like a gentle lamb led to the
slaughter; I did not realize that they had
plotted against me, saying, "Let us
destroy the tree and its fruit; let us cut
him off from the land of the living, that
his name be remembered no more."
20But, O Lord Almighty, you who judge
righteously and test the heart and mind,
let me see your vengeance upon them,
for to you I have committed my cause.
21"Therefore this is what the Lord says
about the men of Anathoth who are
seeking your life and saying, 'Do not
prophesy in the name of the Lord or you
will die by our hands'-
22therefore this is what the Lord
Almighty says: 'I will punish them. Their
young men will die by the sword, their
sons and daughters by famine.
23Not even a remnant will be left to them,
because I will bring disaster on the men
of Anathoth in the year of their
punishment.' "
12You are always righteous, O Lord ,
when I bring a case before you. Yet I
would speak with you about your justice:
Why does the way of the wicked
prosper? Why do all the faithless live at
ease?
2You have planted them, and they have
taken root; they grow and bear fruit. You
are always on their lips but far from their
hearts.
3Yet you know me, O Lord ; you see me
and test my thoughts about you. Drag
them off like sheep to be butchered! Set
them apart for the day of slaughter!
4How long will the land lie parched and
the grass in every field be withered?
Because those who live in it are wicked,
the animals and birds have perished.
Moreover, the people are saying, "He
will not see what happens to us."
5"If you have raced with men on foot and
they have worn you out, how can you
compete with horses? If you stumble in
safe country, how will you manage in
the thickets by the Jordan?
6Your brothers, your own family- even
they have betrayed you; they have
raised a loud cry against you. Do not
trust them, though they speak well of
you.
7"I will forsake my house, abandon my
inheritance; I will give the one I love into
the hands of her enemies.
8My inheritance has become to me like a
lion in the forest. She roars at me;
therefore I hate her.
9Has not my inheritance become to me
like a speckled bird of prey that other
birds of prey surround and attack? Go
and gather all the wild beasts; bring
them to devour.
10Many shepherds will ruin my vineyard
and trample down my field; they will turn
my pleasant field into a desolate
wasteland.
11It will be made a wasteland, parched
and desolate before me; the whole land
will be laid waste because there is no
one who cares.
12Over all the barren heights in the
desert destroyers will swarm, for the
sword of the Lord will devour from one
end of the land to the other; no one will
be safe.
13They will sow wheat but reap thorns;
they will wear themselves out but gain
nothing. So bear the shame of your
harvest because of the Lord 's fierce
anger."
14This is what the Lord says: "As for all
my wicked neighbors who seize the
inheritance I gave my people Israel, I
will uproot them from their lands and I
will uproot the house of Judah from
among them.
15But after I uproot them, I will again
have compassion and will bring each of
them back to his own inheritance and
his own country.
16And if they learn well the ways of my
people and swear by my name, saying,
'As surely as the Lord lives'-even as
they once taught my people to swear by
Baal-then they will be established
among my people.
17But if any nation does not listen, I will
completely uproot and destroy it,"
declares the Lord .
13This is what the Lord said to me:
"Go and buy a linen belt and put it
around your waist, but do not let it touch
water."
2So I bought a belt, as the Lord directed,
and put it around my waist.
3Then the word of the Lord came to me
a second time:
4"Take the belt you bought and are
wearing around your waist, and go now
to Perath and hide it there in a crevice in
the rocks."
5So I went and hid it at Perath, as the
Lord told me.
6Many days later the Lord said to me,
"Go now to Perath and get the belt I told
you to hide there."
7So I went to Perath and dug up the belt
and took it from the place where I had
hidden it, but now it was ruined and
completely useless.
8Then the word of the Lord came to me:
9"This is what the Lord says: 'In the
same way I will ruin the pride of Judah
and the great pride of Jerusalem.
10These wicked people, who refuse to
listen to my words, who follow the
stubbornness of their hearts and go
after other gods to serve and worship
them, will be like this belt-completely
useless!
11For as a belt is bound around a man's
waist, so I bound the whole house of
Israel and the whole house of Judah to
me,' declares the Lord , 'to be my
people for my renown and praise and
honor. But they have not listened.'
12"Say to them: 'This is what the Lord ,
the God of Israel, says: Every wineskin
should be filled with wine.' And if they
say to you, 'Don't we know that every
wineskin should be filled with wine?'
13then tell them, 'This is what the Lord
says: I am going to fill with drunkenness
all who live in this land, including the
kings who sit on David's throne, the
priests, the prophets and all those living
in Jerusalem.
14I will smash them one against the
other, fathers and sons alike, declares
the Lord . I will allow no pity or mercy or
compassion to keep me from destroying
them.' "
15Hear and pay attention, do not be
arrogant, for the Lord has spoken.
16Give glory to the Lord your God before
he brings the darkness, before your feet
stumble on the darkening hills. You
hope for light, but he will turn it to thick
darkness and change it to deep gloom.
17But if you do not listen, I will weep in
secret because of your pride; my eyes
will weep bitterly, overflowing with tears,
because the Lord 's flock will be taken
captive.
18Say to the king and to the queen
mother, "Come down from your thrones,
for your glorious crowns will fall from
your heads."
19The cities in the Negev will be shut up,
and there will be no one to open them.
All Judah will be carried into exile,
carried completely away.
20Lift up your eyes and see those who
are coming from the north. Where is the
flock that was entrusted to you, the
sheep of which you boasted?
21What will you say when the Lord sets
over you those you cultivated as your
special allies? Will not pain grip you like
that of a woman in labor?
22And if you ask yourself, "Why has this
happened to me?"- it is because of your
many sins that your skirts have been
torn off and your body mistreated.
23Can the Ethiopian change his skin or
the leopard its spots? Neither can you
do good who are accustomed to doing
evil.
24"I will scatter you like chaff driven by
the desert wind.
25This is your lot, the portion I have
decreed for you," declares the Lord ,
"because you have forgotten me and
trusted in false gods.
26I will pull up your skirts over your face
that your shame may be seen-
27your adulteries and lustful neighings,
your shameless prostitution! I have seen
your detestable acts on the hills and in
the fields. Woe to you, O Jerusalem!
How long will you be unclean?"
14This is the word of the Lord to
Jeremiah concerning the drought:
2"Judah mourns, her cities languish;
they wail for the land, and a cry goes up
from Jerusalem.
3The nobles send their servants for
water; they go to the cisterns but find no
water. They return with their jars
unfilled; dismayed and despairing, they
cover their heads.
4The ground is cracked because there is
no rain in the land; the farmers are
dismayed and cover their heads.
5Even the doe in the field deserts her
newborn fawn because there is no grass.
6Wild donkeys stand on the barren
heights and pant like jackals; their
eyesight fails for lack of pasture."
7Although our sins testify against us, O
Lord , do something for the sake of your
name. For our backsliding is great; we
have sinned against you.
8O Hope of Israel, its Savior in times of
distress, why are you like a stranger in
the land, like a traveler who stays only a
night?
9Why are you like a man taken by
surprise, like a warrior powerless to
save? You are among us, O Lord , and
we bear your name; do not forsake us!
10This is what the Lord says about this
people: "They greatly love to wander;
they do not restrain their feet. So the
Lord does not accept them; he will now
remember their wickedness and punish
them for their sins."
11Then the Lord said to me, "Do not pray
for the well-being of this people.
12Although they fast, I will not listen to
their cry; though they offer burnt
offerings and grain offerings, I will not
accept them. Instead, I will destroy them
with the sword, famine and plague."
13But I said, "Ah, Sovereign Lord , the
prophets keep telling them, 'You will not
see the sword or suffer famine. Indeed, I
will give you lasting peace in this place.'
"
14Then the Lord said to me, "The
prophets are prophesying lies in my
name. I have not sent them or appointed
them or spoken to them. They are
prophesying to you false visions,
divinations, idolatries and the delusions
of their own minds.
15Therefore, this is what the Lord says
about the prophets who are prophesying
in my name: I did not send them, yet
they are saying, 'No sword or famine will
touch this land.' Those same prophets
will perish by sword and famine.
16And the people they are prophesying
to will be thrown out into the streets of
Jerusalem because of the famine and
sword. There will be no one to bury
them or their wives, their sons or their
daughters. I will pour out on them the
calamity they deserve.
17"Speak this word to them: " 'Let my
eyes overflow with tears night and day
without ceasing; for my virgin daughtermy
people- has suffered a grievous
wound, a crushing blow.
18If I go into the country, I see those
slain by the sword; if I go into the city, I
see the ravages of famine. Both prophet
and priest have gone to a land they
know not.' "
19Have you rejected Judah completely?
Do you despise Zion? Why have you
afflicted us so that we cannot be
healed? We hoped for peace but no
good has come, for a time of healing but
there is only terror.
20O Lord , we acknowledge our
wickedness and the guilt of our fathers;
we have indeed sinned against you.
21For the sake of your name do not
despise us; do not dishonor your
glorious throne. Remember your
covenant with us and do not break it.
22Do any of the worthless idols of the
nations bring rain? Do the skies
themselves send down showers? No, it
is you, O Lord our God. Therefore our
hope is in you, for you are the one who
does all this.
15Then the Lord said to me: "Even if
Moses and Samuel were to stand before
me, my heart would not go out to this
people. Send them away from my
presence! Let them go!
2And if they ask you, 'Where shall we
go?' tell them, 'This is what the Lord
says: " 'Those destined for death, to
death; those for the sword, to the sword;
those for starvation, to starvation; those
for captivity, to captivity.'
3"I will send four kinds of destroyers
against them," declares the Lord , "the
sword to kill and the dogs to drag away
and the birds of the air and the beasts of
the earth to devour and destroy.
4I will make them abhorrent to all the
kingdoms of the earth because of what
Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of
Judah did in Jerusalem.
5"Who will have pity on you, O
Jerusalem? Who will mourn for you?
Who will stop to ask how you are?
6You have rejected me," declares the
Lord . "You keep on backsliding. So I
will lay hands on you and destroy you; I
can no longer show compassion.
7I will winnow them with a winnowing
fork at the city gates of the land. I will
bring bereavement and destruction on
my people, for they have not changed
their ways.
8I will make their widows more
numerous than the sand of the sea. At
midday I will bring a destroyer against
the mothers of their young men;
suddenly I will bring down on them
anguish and terror.
9The mother of seven will grow faint and
breathe her last. Her sun will set while it
is still day; she will be disgraced and
humiliated. I will put the survivors to the
sword before their enemies," declares
the Lord .
10Alas, my mother, that you gave me
birth, a man with whom the whole land
strives and contends! I have neither lent
nor borrowed, yet everyone curses me.
11The Lord said, "Surely I will deliver you
for a good purpose; surely I will make
your enemies plead with you in times of
disaster and times of distress.
12"Can a man break iron- iron from the
north-or bronze?
13Your wealth and your treasures I will
give as plunder, without charge,
because of all your sins throughout your
country.
14I will enslave you to your enemies in a
land you do not know, for my anger will
kindle a fire that will burn against you."
15You understand, O Lord ; remember
me and care for me. Avenge me on my
persecutors. You are long-suffering-do
not take me away; think of how I suffer
reproach for your sake.
16When your words came, I ate them;
they were my joy and my heart's delight,
for I bear your name, O Lord God
Almighty.
17I never sat in the company of revelers,
never made merry with them; I sat alone
because your hand was on me and you
had filled me with indignation.
18Why is my pain unending and my
wound grievous and incurable? Will you
be to me like a deceptive brook, like a
spring that fails?
19Therefore this is what the Lord says:
"If you repent, I will restore you that you
may serve me; if you utter worthy, not
worthless, words, you will be my
spokesman. Let this people turn to you,
but you must not turn to them.
20I will make you a wall to this people, a
fortified wall of bronze; they will fight
against you but will not overcome you,
for I am with you to rescue and save
you," declares the Lord .
21"I will save you from the hands of the
wicked and redeem you from the grasp
of the cruel."
16Then the word of the Lord came to
me:
2"You must not marry and have sons or
daughters in this place."
3For this is what the Lord says about the
sons and daughters born in this land
and about the women who are their
mothers and the men who are their
fathers:
4"They will die of deadly diseases. They
will not be mourned or buried but will be
like refuse lying on the ground. They will
perish by sword and famine, and their
dead bodies will become food for the
birds of the air and the beasts of the
earth."
5For this is what the Lord says: "Do not
enter a house where there is a funeral
meal; do not go to mourn or show
sympathy, because I have withdrawn
my blessing, my love and my pity from
this people," declares the Lord .
6"Both high and low will die in this land.
They will not be buried or mourned, and
no one will cut himself or shave his head
for them.
7No one will offer food to comfort those
who mourn for the dead-not even for a
father or a mother-nor will anyone give
them a drink to console them.
8"And do not enter a house where there
is feasting and sit down to eat and drink.
9For this is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: Before your eyes
and in your days I will bring an end to
the sounds of joy and gladness and to
the voices of bride and bridegroom in
this place.
10"When you tell these people all this
and they ask you, 'Why has the Lord
decreed such a great disaster against
us? What wrong have we done? What
sin have we committed against the Lord
our God?'
11then say to them, 'It is because your
fathers forsook me,' declares the Lord ,
'and followed other gods and served and
worshiped them. They forsook me and
did not keep my law.
12But you have behaved more wickedly
than your fathers. See how each of you
is following the stubbornness of his evil
heart instead of obeying me.
13So I will throw you out of this land into
a land neither you nor your fathers have
known, and there you will serve other
gods day and night, for I will show you
no favor.'
14"However, the days are coming,"
declares the Lord , "when men will no
longer say, 'As surely as the Lord lives,
who brought the Israelites up out of
Egypt,'
15but they will say, 'As surely as the Lord
lives, who brought the Israelites up out
of the land of the north and out of all the
countries where he had banished them.'
For I will restore them to the land I gave
their forefathers.
16"But now I will send for many
fishermen," declares the Lord , "and
they will catch them. After that I will
send for many hunters, and they will
hunt them down on every mountain and
hill and from the crevices of the rocks.
17My eyes are on all their ways; they are
not hidden from me, nor is their sin
concealed from my eyes.
18I will repay them double for their
wickedness and their sin, because they
have defiled my land with the lifeless
forms of their vile images and have filled
my inheritance with their detestable
idols."
19O Lord , my strength and my fortress,
my refuge in time of distress, to you the
nations will come from the ends of the
earth and say, "Our fathers possessed
nothing but false gods, worthless idols
that did them no good.
20Do men make their own gods? Yes,
but they are not gods!"
21"Therefore I will teach them- this time I
will teach them my power and might.
Then they will know that my name is the
Lord .
17"Judah's sin is engraved with an
iron tool, inscribed with a flint point, on
the tablets of their hearts and on the
horns of their altars.
2Even their children remember their
altars and Asherah poles beside the
spreading trees and on the high hills.
3My mountain in the land and your
wealth and all your treasures I will give
away as plunder, together with your high
places, because of sin throughout your
country.
4Through your own fault you will lose the
inheritance I gave you. I will enslave you
to your enemies in a land you do not
know, for you have kindled my anger,
and it will burn forever."
5This is what the Lord says: "Cursed is
the one who trusts in man, who depends
on flesh for his strength and whose
heart turns away from the Lord .
6He will be like a bush in the
wastelands; he will not see prosperity
when it comes. He will dwell in the
parched places of the desert, in a salt
land where no one lives.
7"But blessed is the man who trusts in
the Lord , whose confidence is in him.
8He will be like a tree planted by the
water that sends out its roots by the
stream. It does not fear when heat
comes; its leaves are always green. It
has no worries in a year of drought and
never fails to bear fruit."
9The heart is deceitful above all things
and beyond cure. Who can understand
it?
10"I the Lord search the heart and
examine the mind, to reward a man
according to his conduct, according to
what his deeds deserve."
11Like a partridge that hatches eggs it
did not lay is the man who gains riches
by unjust means. When his life is half
gone, they will desert him, and in the
end he will prove to be a fool.
12A glorious throne, exalted from the
beginning, is the place of our sanctuary.
13O Lord , the hope of Israel, all who
forsake you will be put to shame. Those
who turn away from you will be written in
the dust because they have forsaken
the Lord , the spring of living water.
14Heal me, O Lord , and I will be healed;
save me and I will be saved, for you are
the one I praise.
15They keep saying to me, "Where is the
word of the Lord ? Let it now be
fulfilled!"
16I have not run away from being your
shepherd; you know I have not desired
the day of despair. What passes my lips
is open before you.
17Do not be a terror to me; you are my
refuge in the day of disaster.
18Let my persecutors be put to shame,
but keep me from shame; let them be
terrified, but keep me from terror. Bring
on them the day of disaster; destroy
them with double destruction.
19This is what the Lord said to me: "Go
and stand at the gate of the people,
through which the kings of Judah go in
and out; stand also at all the other gates
of Jerusalem.
20Say to them, 'Hear the word of the
Lord , O kings of Judah and all people of
Judah and everyone living in Jerusalem
who come through these gates.
21This is what the Lord says: Be careful
not to carry a load on the Sabbath day
or bring it through the gates of
Jerusalem.
22Do not bring a load out of your houses
or do any work on the Sabbath, but
keep the Sabbath day holy, as I
commanded your forefathers.
23Yet they did not listen or pay attention;
they were stiff-necked and would not
listen or respond to discipline.
24But if you are careful to obey me,
declares the Lord , and bring no load
through the gates of this city on the
Sabbath, but keep the Sabbath day holy
by not doing any work on it,
25then kings who sit on David's throne
will come through the gates of this city
with their officials. They and their
officials will come riding in chariots and
on horses, accompanied by the men of
Judah and those living in Jerusalem,
and this city will be inhabited forever.
26People will come from the towns of
Judah and the villages around
Jerusalem, from the territory of
Benjamin and the western foothills, from
the hill country and the Negev, bringing
burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain
offerings, incense and thank offerings to
the house of the Lord .
27But if you do not obey me to keep the
Sabbath day holy by not carrying any
load as you come through the gates of
Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I
will kindle an unquenchable fire in the
gates of Jerusalem that will consume
her fortresses.' "
18This is the word that came to
Jeremiah from the Lord :
2"Go down to the potter's house, and
there I will give you my message."
3So I went down to the potter's house,
and I saw him working at the wheel.
4But the pot he was shaping from the
clay was marred in his hands; so the
potter formed it into another pot,
shaping it as seemed best to him.
5Then the word of the Lord came to me:
6"O house of Israel, can I not do with
you as this potter does?" declares the
Lord . "Like clay in the hand of the potter,
so are you in my hand, O house of
Israel.
7If at any time I announce that a nation
or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down
and destroyed,
8and if that nation I warned repents of its
evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it
the disaster I had planned.
9And if at another time I announce that a
nation or kingdom is to be built up and
planted,
10and if it does evil in my sight and does
not obey me, then I will reconsider the
good I had intended to do for it.
11"Now therefore say to the people of
Judah and those living in Jerusalem,
'This is what the Lord says: Look! I am
preparing a disaster for you and
devising a plan against you. So turn
from your evil ways, each one of you,
and reform your ways and your actions.'
12But they will reply, 'It's no use. We will
continue with our own plans; each of us
will follow the stubbornness of his evil
heart.' "
13Therefore this is what the Lord says:
"Inquire among the nations: Who has
ever heard anything like this? A most
horrible thing has been done by Virgin
Israel.
14Does the snow of Lebanon ever
vanish from its rocky slopes? Do its cool
waters from distant sources ever cease
to flow?
15Yet my people have forgotten me; they
burn incense to worthless idols, which
made them stumble in their ways and in
the ancient paths. They made them walk
in bypaths and on roads not built up.
16Their land will be laid waste, an object
of lasting scorn; all who pass by will be
appalled and will shake their heads.
17Like a wind from the east, I will scatter
them before their enemies; I will show
them my back and not my face in the
day of their disaster."
18They said, "Come, let's make plans
against Jeremiah; for the teaching of the
law by the priest will not be lost, nor will
counsel from the wise, nor the word
from the prophets. So come, let's attack
him with our tongues and pay no
attention to anything he says."
19Listen to me, O Lord ; hear what my
accusers are saying!
20Should good be repaid with evil? Yet
they have dug a pit for me. Remember
that I stood before you and spoke in
their behalf to turn your wrath away from
them.
21So give their children over to famine;
hand them over to the power of the
sword. Let their wives be made childless
and widows; let their men be put to
death, their young men slain by the
sword in battle.
22Let a cry be heard from their houses
when you suddenly bring invaders
against them, for they have dug a pit to
capture me and have hidden snares for
my feet.
23But you know, O Lord , all their plots to
kill me. Do not forgive their crimes or
blot out their sins from your sight. Let
them be overthrown before you; deal
with them in the time of your anger.
19This is what the Lord says: "Go
and buy a clay jar from a potter. Take
along some of the elders of the people
and of the priests
2and go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom,
near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate.
There proclaim the words I tell you,
3and say, 'Hear the word of the Lord , O
kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem.
This is what the Lord Almighty, the God
of Israel, says: Listen! I am going to
bring a disaster on this place that will
make the ears of everyone who hears of
it tingle.
4For they have forsaken me and made
this a place of foreign gods; they have
burned sacrifices in it to gods that
neither they nor their fathers nor the
kings of Judah ever knew, and they
have filled this place with the blood of
the innocent.
5They have built the high places of Baal
to burn their sons in the fire as offerings
to Baal-something I did not command or
mention, nor did it enter my mind.
6So beware, the days are coming,
declares the Lord , when people will no
longer call this place Topheth or the
Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of
Slaughter.
7" 'In this place I will ruin the plans of
Judah and Jerusalem. I will make them
fall by the sword before their enemies,
at the hands of those who seek their
lives, and I will give their carcasses as
food to the birds of the air and the
beasts of the earth.
8I will devastate this city and make it an
object of scorn; all who pass by will be
appalled and will scoff because of all its
wounds.
9I will make them eat the flesh of their
sons and daughters, and they will eat
one another's flesh during the stress of
the siege imposed on them by the
enemies who seek their lives.'
10"Then break the jar while those who go
with you are watching,
11and say to them, 'This is what the Lord
Almighty says: I will smash this nation
and this city just as this potter's jar is
smashed and cannot be repaired. They
will bury the dead in Topheth until there
is no more room.
12This is what I will do to this place and
to those who live here, declares the
Lord . I will make this city like Topheth.
13The houses in Jerusalem and those of
the kings of Judah will be defiled like
this place, Topheth-all the houses where
they burned incense on the roofs to all
the starry hosts and poured out drink
offerings to other gods.' "
14Jeremiah then returned from Topheth,
where the Lord had sent him to
prophesy, and stood in the court of the
Lord 's temple and said to all the people,
15"This is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: 'Listen! I am going
to bring on this city and the villages
around it every disaster I pronounced
against them, because they were stiffnecked
and would not listen to my
words.' "
20When the priest Pashhur son of
Immer, the chief officer in the temple of
the Lord , heard Jeremiah prophesying
these things,
2he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten
and put in the stocks at the Upper Gate
of Benjamin at the Lord 's temple.
3The next day, when Pashhur released
him from the stocks, Jeremiah said to
him, "The Lord 's name for you is not
Pashhur, but Magor-Missabib.
4For this is what the Lord says: 'I will
make you a terror to yourself and to all
your friends; with your own eyes you will
see them fall by the sword of their
enemies. I will hand all Judah over to
the king of Babylon, who will carry them
away to Babylon or put them to the
sword.
5I will hand over to their enemies all the
wealth of this city-all its products, all its
valuables and all the treasures of the
kings of Judah. They will take it away as
plunder and carry it off to Babylon.
6And you, Pashhur, and all who live in
your house will go into exile to Babylon.
There you will die and be buried, you
and all your friends to whom you have
prophesied lies.' "
7O Lord , you deceived me, and I was
deceived ; you overpowered me and
prevailed. I am ridiculed all day long;
everyone mocks me.
8Whenever I speak, I cry out proclaiming
violence and destruction. So the word of
the Lord has brought me insult and
reproach all day long.
9But if I say, "I will not mention him or
speak any more in his name," his word
is in my heart like a fire, a fire shut up in
my bones. I am weary of holding it in;
indeed, I cannot.
10I hear many whispering, "Terror on
every side! Report him! Let's report
him!" All my friends are waiting for me to
slip, saying, "Perhaps he will be
deceived; then we will prevail over him
and take our revenge on him."
11But the Lord is with me like a mighty
warrior; so my persecutors will stumble
and not prevail. They will fail and be
thoroughly disgraced; their dishonor will
never be forgotten.
12O Lord Almighty, you who examine the
righteous and probe the heart and mind,
let me see your vengeance upon them,
for to you I have committed my cause.
13Sing to the Lord ! Give praise to the
Lord ! He rescues the life of the needy
from the hands of the wicked.
14Cursed be the day I was born! May the
day my mother bore me not be blessed!
15Cursed be the man who brought my
father the news, who made him very
glad, saying, "A child is born to you-a
son!"
16May that man be like the towns the
Lord overthrew without pity. May he
hear wailing in the morning, a battle cry
at noon.
17For he did not kill me in the womb,
with my mother as my grave, her womb
enlarged forever.
18Why did I ever come out of the womb
to see trouble and sorrow and to end my
days in shame?
21The word came to Jeremiah from
the Lord when King Zedekiah sent to
him Pashhur son of Malkijah and the
priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. They
said:
2"Inquire now of the Lord for us because
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is
attacking us. Perhaps the Lord will
perform wonders for us as in times past
so that he will withdraw from us."
3But Jeremiah answered them, "Tell
Zedekiah,
4'This is what the Lord , the God of
Israel, says: I am about to turn against
you the weapons of war that are in your
hands, which you are using to fight the
king of Babylon and the Babylonians
who are outside the wall besieging you.
And I will gather them inside this city.
5I myself will fight against you with an
outstretched hand and a mighty arm in
anger and fury and great wrath.
6I will strike down those who live in this
city-both men and animals-and they will
die of a terrible plague.
7After that, declares the Lord , I will hand
over Zedekiah king of Judah, his
officials and the people in this city who
survive the plague, sword and famine, to
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to
their enemies who seek their lives. He
will put them to the sword; he will show
them no mercy or pity or compassion.'
8"Furthermore, tell the people, 'This is
what the Lord says: See, I am setting
before you the way of life and the way of
death.
9Whoever stays in this city will die by the
sword, famine or plague. But whoever
goes out and surrenders to the
Babylonians who are besieging you will
live; he will escape with his life.
10I have determined to do this city harm
and not good, declares the Lord . It will
be given into the hands of the king of
Babylon, and he will destroy it with fire.'
11"Moreover, say to the royal house of
Judah, 'Hear the word of the Lord ;
12O house of David, this is what the Lord
says: " 'Administer justice every
morning; rescue from the hand of his
oppressor the one who has been robbed,
or my wrath will break out and burn like
fire because of the evil you have doneburn
with no one to quench it.
13I am against you, Jerusalem, you who
live above this valley on the rocky
plateau, declares the Lord - you who
say, "Who can come against us? Who
can enter our refuge?"
14I will punish you as your deeds
deserve, declares the Lord . I will kindle
a fire in your forests that will consume
everything around you.' "
22This is what the Lord says: "Go
down to the palace of the king of Judah
and proclaim this message there:
2'Hear the word of the Lord , O king of
Judah, you who sit on David's throneyou,
your officials and your people who
come through these gates.
3This is what the Lord says: Do what is
just and right. Rescue from the hand of
his oppressor the one who has been
robbed. Do no wrong or violence to the
alien, the fatherless or the widow, and
do not shed innocent blood in this place.
4For if you are careful to carry out these
commands, then kings who sit on
David's throne will come through the
gates of this palace, riding in chariots
and on horses, accompanied by their
officials and their people.
5But if you do not obey these commands,
declares the Lord , I swear by myself
that this palace will become a ruin.' "
6For this is what the Lord says about the
palace of the king of Judah: "Though
you are like Gilead to me, like the
summit of Lebanon, I will surely make
you like a desert, like towns not
inhabited.
7I will send destroyers against you, each
man with his weapons, and they will cut
up your fine cedar beams and throw
them into the fire.
8"People from many nations will pass by
this city and will ask one another, 'Why
has the Lord done such a thing to this
great city?'
9And the answer will be: 'Because they
have forsaken the covenant of the Lord
their God and have worshiped and
served other gods.' "
10Do not weep for the dead king or
mourn his loss; rather, weep bitterly for
him who is exiled, because he will never
return nor see his native land again.
11For this is what the Lord says about
Shallum son of Josiah, who succeeded
his father as king of Judah but has gone
from this place: "He will never return.
12He will die in the place where they
have led him captive; he will not see this
land again."
13"Woe to him who builds his palace by
unrighteousness, his upper rooms by
injustice, making his countrymen work
for nothing, not paying them for their
labor.
14He says, 'I will build myself a great
palace with spacious upper rooms.' So
he makes large windows in it, panels it
with cedar and decorates it in red.
15"Does it make you a king to have more
and more cedar? Did not your father
have food and drink? He did what was
right and just, so all went well with him.
16He defended the cause of the poor
and needy, and so all went well. Is that
not what it means to know me?"
declares the Lord .
17"But your eyes and your heart are set
only on dishonest gain, on shedding
innocent blood and on oppression and
extortion."
18Therefore this is what the Lord says
about Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of
Judah: "They will not mourn for him:
'Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!' They
will not mourn for him: 'Alas, my master!
Alas, his splendor!'
19He will have the burial of a donkeydragged
away and thrown outside the
gates of Jerusalem."
20"Go up to Lebanon and cry out, let
your voice be heard in Bashan, cry out
from Abarim, for all your allies are
crushed.
21I warned you when you felt secure, but
you said, 'I will not listen!' This has been
your way from your youth; you have not
obeyed me.
22The wind will drive all your shepherds
away, and your allies will go into exile.
Then you will be ashamed and
disgraced because of all your
wickedness.
23You who live in 'Lebanon, ' who are
nestled in cedar buildings, how you will
groan when pangs come upon you, pain
like that of a woman in labor!
24"As surely as I live," declares the Lord ,
"even if you, Jehoiachin son of
Jehoiakim king of Judah, were a signet
ring on my right hand, I would still pull
you off.
25I will hand you over to those who seek
your life, those you fear-to
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to
the Babylonians.
26I will hurl you and the mother who
gave you birth into another country,
where neither of you was born, and
there you both will die.
27You will never come back to the land
you long to return to."
28Is this man Jehoiachin a despised,
broken pot, an object no one wants?
Why will he and his children be hurled
out, cast into a land they do not know?
29O land, land, land, hear the word of
the Lord !
30This is what the Lord says: "Record
this man as if childless, a man who will
not prosper in his lifetime, for none of
his offspring will prosper, none will sit on
the throne of David or rule anymore in
Judah."
23"Woe to the shepherds who are
destroying and scattering the sheep of
my pasture!" declares the Lord .
2Therefore this is what the Lord , the
God of Israel, says to the shepherds
who tend my people: "Because you
have scattered my flock and driven them
away and have not bestowed care on
them, I will bestow punishment on you
for the evil you have done," declares the
Lord .
3"I myself will gather the remnant of my
flock out of all the countries where I
have driven them and will bring them
back to their pasture, where they will be
fruitful and increase in number.
4I will place shepherds over them who
will tend them, and they will no longer
be afraid or terrified, nor will any be
missing," declares the Lord .
5"The days are coming," declares the
Lord , "when I will raise up to David a
righteous Branch, a King who will reign
wisely and do what is just and right in
the land.
6In his days Judah will be saved and
Israel will live in safety. This is the name
by which he will be called: The Lord Our
Righteousness.
7"So then, the days are coming,"
declares the Lord , "when people will no
longer say, 'As surely as the Lord lives,
who brought the Israelites up out of
Egypt,'
8but they will say, 'As surely as the Lord
lives, who brought the descendants of
Israel up out of the land of the north and
out of all the countries where he had
banished them.' Then they will live in
their own land."
9Concerning the prophets: My heart is
broken within me; all my bones tremble.
I am like a drunken man, like a man
overcome by wine, because of the Lord
and his holy words.
10The land is full of adulterers; because
of the curse the land lies parched and
the pastures in the desert are withered.
The prophets follow an evil course and
use their power unjustly.
11"Both prophet and priest are godless;
even in my temple I find their
wickedness," declares the Lord .
12"Therefore their path will become
slippery; they will be banished to
darkness and there they will fall. I will
bring disaster on them in the year they
are punished," declares the Lord .
13"Among the prophets of Samaria I saw
this repulsive thing: They prophesied by
Baal and led my people Israel astray.
14And among the prophets of Jerusalem
I have seen something horrible: They
commit adultery and live a lie. They
strengthen the hands of evildoers, so
that no one turns from his wickedness.
They are all like Sodom to me; the
people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah."
15Therefore, this is what the Lord
Almighty says concerning the prophets:
"I will make them eat bitter food and
drink poisoned water, because from the
prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has
spread throughout the land."
16This is what the Lord Almighty says:
"Do not listen to what the prophets are
prophesying to you; they fill you with
false hopes. They speak visions from
their own minds, not from the mouth of
the Lord .
17They keep saying to those who
despise me, 'The Lord says: You will
have peace.' And to all who follow the
stubbornness of their hearts they say,
'No harm will come to you.'
18But which of them has stood in the
council of the Lord to see or to hear his
word? Who has listened and heard his
word?
19See, the storm of the Lord will burst
out in wrath, a whirlwind swirling down
on the heads of the wicked.
20The anger of the Lord will not turn
back until he fully accomplishes the
purposes of his heart. In days to come
you will understand it clearly.
21I did not send these prophets, yet they
have run with their message; I did not
speak to them, yet they have
prophesied.
22But if they had stood in my council,
they would have proclaimed my words
to my people and would have turned
them from their evil ways and from their
evil deeds.
23"Am I only a God nearby," declares the
Lord , "and not a God far away?
24Can anyone hide in secret places so
that I cannot see him?" declares the
Lord . "Do not I fill heaven and earth?"
declares the Lord .
25"I have heard what the prophets say
who prophesy lies in my name. They
say, 'I had a dream! I had a dream!'
26How long will this continue in the
hearts of these lying prophets, who
prophesy the delusions of their own
minds?
27They think the dreams they tell one
another will make my people forget my
name, just as their fathers forgot my
name through Baal worship.
28Let the prophet who has a dream tell
his dream, but let the one who has my
word speak it faithfully. For what has
straw to do with grain?" declares the
Lord .
29"Is not my word like fire," declares the
Lord , "and like a hammer that breaks a
rock in pieces?
30"Therefore," declares the Lord , "I am
against the prophets who steal from one
another words supposedly from me.
31Yes," declares the Lord , "I am against
the prophets who wag their own tongues
and yet declare, 'The Lord declares.'
32Indeed, I am against those who
prophesy false dreams," declares the
Lord . "They tell them and lead my
people astray with their reckless lies, yet
I did not send or appoint them. They do
not benefit these people in the least,"
declares the Lord .
33"When these people, or a prophet or a
priest, ask you, 'What is the oracle of the
Lord ?' say to them, 'What oracle? I will
forsake you, declares the Lord .'
34If a prophet or a priest or anyone else
claims, 'This is the oracle of the Lord ,' I
will punish that man and his household.
35This is what each of you keeps on
saying to his friend or relative: 'What is
the Lord 's answer?' or 'What has the
Lord spoken?'
36But you must not mention 'the oracle
of the Lord ' again, because every man's
own word becomes his oracle and so
you distort the words of the living God,
the Lord Almighty, our God.
37This is what you keep saying to a
prophet: 'What is the Lord 's answer to
you?' or 'What has the Lord spoken?'
38Although you claim, 'This is the oracle
of the Lord ,' this is what the Lord says:
You used the words, 'This is the oracle
of the Lord ,' even though I told you that
you must not claim, 'This is the oracle of
the Lord .'
39Therefore, I will surely forget you and
cast you out of my presence along with
the city I gave to you and your fathers.
40I will bring upon you everlasting
disgrace-everlasting shame that will not
be forgotten."
24After Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim
king of Judah and the officials, the
craftsmen and the artisans of Judah
were carried into exile from Jerusalem
to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon, the Lord showed me two
baskets of figs placed in front of the
temple of the Lord .
2One basket had very good figs, like
those that ripen early; the other basket
had very poor figs, so bad they could
not be eaten.
3Then the Lord asked me, "What do you
see, Jeremiah?" "Figs," I answered.
"The good ones are very good, but the
poor ones are so bad they cannot be
eaten."
4Then the word of the Lord came to me:
5"This is what the Lord , the God of
Israel, says: 'Like these good figs, I
regard as good the exiles from Judah,
whom I sent away from this place to the
land of the Babylonians.
6My eyes will watch over them for their
good, and I will bring them back to this
land. I will build them up and not tear
them down; I will plant them and not
uproot them.
7I will give them a heart to know me, that
I am the Lord . They will be my people,
and I will be their God, for they will
return to me with all their heart.
8" 'But like the poor figs, which are so
bad they cannot be eaten,' says the
Lord , 'so will I deal with Zedekiah king
of Judah, his officials and the survivors
from Jerusalem, whether they remain in
this land or live in Egypt.
9I will make them abhorrent and an
offense to all the kingdoms of the earth,
a reproach and a byword, an object of
ridicule and cursing, wherever I banish
them.
10I will send the sword, famine and
plague against them until they are
destroyed from the land I gave to them
and their fathers.' "
25The word came to Jeremiah
concerning all the people of Judah in the
fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah
king of Judah, which was the first year
of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
2So Jeremiah the prophet said to all the
people of Judah and to all those living in
Jerusalem:
3For twenty-three years-from the
thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon
king of Judah until this very day-the
word of the Lord has come to me and I
have spoken to you again and again,
but you have not listened.
4And though the Lord has sent all his
servants the prophets to you again and
again, you have not listened or paid any
attention.
5They said, "Turn now, each of you,
from your evil ways and your evil
practices, and you can stay in the land
the Lord gave to you and your fathers
for ever and ever.
6Do not follow other gods to serve and
worship them; do not provoke me to
anger with what your hands have made.
Then I will not harm you."
7"But you did not listen to me," declares
the Lord , "and you have provoked me
with what your hands have made, and
you have brought harm to yourselves."
8Therefore the Lord Almighty says this:
"Because you have not listened to my
words,
9I will summon all the peoples of the
north and my servant Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon," declares the Lord ,
"and I will bring them against this land
and its inhabitants and against all the
surrounding nations. I will completely
destroy them and make them an object
of horror and scorn, and an everlasting
ruin.
10I will banish from them the sounds of
joy and gladness, the voices of bride
and bridegroom, the sound of millstones
and the light of the lamp.
11This whole country will become a
desolate wasteland, and these nations
will serve the king of Babylon seventy
years.
12"But when the seventy years are
fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon
and his nation, the land of the
Babylonians, for their guilt," declares the
Lord , "and will make it desolate forever.
13I will bring upon that land all the things
I have spoken against it, all that are
written in this book and prophesied by
Jeremiah against all the nations.
14They themselves will be enslaved by
many nations and great kings; I will
repay them according to their deeds and
the work of their hands."
15This is what the Lord , the God of
Israel, said to me: "Take from my hand
this cup filled with the wine of my wrath
and make all the nations to whom I send
you drink it.
16When they drink it, they will stagger
and go mad because of the sword I will
send among them."
17So I took the cup from the Lord 's hand
and made all the nations to whom he
sent me drink it:
18Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, its
kings and officials, to make them a ruin
and an object of horror and scorn and
cursing, as they are today;
19Pharaoh king of Egypt, his attendants,
his officials and all his people,
20and all the foreign people there; all the
kings of Uz; all the kings of the
Philistines (those of Ashkelon, Gaza,
Ekron, and the people left at Ashdod);
21Edom, Moab and Ammon;
22all the kings of Tyre and Sidon; the
kings of the coastlands across the sea;
23Dedan, Tema, Buz and all who are in
distant places ;
24all the kings of Arabia and all the kings
of the foreign people who live in the
desert;
25all the kings of Zimri, Elam and Media;
26and all the kings of the north, near and
far, one after the other-all the kingdoms
on the face of the earth. And after all of
them, the king of Sheshach will drink it
too.
27"Then tell them, 'This is what the Lord
Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Drink,
get drunk and vomit, and fall to rise no
more because of the sword I will send
among you.'
28But if they refuse to take the cup from
your hand and drink, tell them, 'This is
what the Lord Almighty says: You must
drink it!
29See, I am beginning to bring disaster
on the city that bears my Name, and will
you indeed go unpunished? You will not
go unpunished, for I am calling down a
sword upon all who live on the earth,
declares the Lord Almighty.'
30"Now prophesy all these words against
them and say to them: " 'The Lord will
roar from on high; he will thunder from
his holy dwelling and roar mightily
against his land. He will shout like those
who tread the grapes, shout against all
who live on the earth.
31The tumult will resound to the ends of
the earth, for the Lord will bring charges
against the nations; he will bring
judgment on all mankind and put the
wicked to the sword,' " declares the
Lord .
32This is what the Lord Almighty says:
"Look! Disaster is spreading from nation
to nation; a mighty storm is rising from
the ends of the earth."
33At that time those slain by the Lord will
be everywhere-from one end of the
earth to the other. They will not be
mourned or gathered up or buried, but
will be like refuse lying on the ground.
34Weep and wail, you shepherds; roll in
the dust, you leaders of the flock. For
your time to be slaughtered has come;
you will fall and be shattered like fine
pottery.
35The shepherds will have nowhere to
flee, the leaders of the flock no place to
escape.
36Hear the cry of the shepherds, the
wailing of the leaders of the flock, for the
Lord is destroying their pasture.
37The peaceful meadows will be laid
waste because of the fierce anger of the
Lord .
38Like a lion he will leave his lair, and
their land will become desolate because
of the sword of the oppressor and
because of the Lord 's fierce anger.
26Early in the reign of Jehoiakim son
of Josiah king of Judah, this word came
from the Lord :
2"This is what the Lord says: Stand in
the courtyard of the Lord 's house and
speak to all the people of the towns of
Judah who come to worship in the
house of the Lord . Tell them everything
I command you; do not omit a word.
3Perhaps they will listen and each will
turn from his evil way. Then I will relent
and not bring on them the disaster I was
planning because of the evil they have
done.
4Say to them, 'This is what the Lord
says: If you do not listen to me and
follow my law, which I have set before
you,
5and if you do not listen to the words of
my servants the prophets, whom I have
sent to you again and again (though you
have not listened),
6then I will make this house like Shiloh
and this city an object of cursing among
all the nations of the earth.' "
7The priests, the prophets and all the
people heard Jeremiah speak these
words in the house of the Lord .
8But as soon as Jeremiah finished telling
all the people everything the Lord had
commanded him to say, the priests, the
prophets and all the people seized him
and said, "You must die!
9Why do you prophesy in the Lord 's
name that this house will be like Shiloh
and this city will be desolate and
deserted?" And all the people crowded
around Jeremiah in the house of the
Lord .
10When the officials of Judah heard
about these things, they went up from
the royal palace to the house of the Lord
and took their places at the entrance of
the New Gate of the Lord 's house.
11Then the priests and the prophets said
to the officials and all the people, "This
man should be sentenced to death
because he has prophesied against this
city. You have heard it with your own
ears!"
12Then Jeremiah said to all the officials
and all the people: "The Lord sent me to
prophesy against this house and this
city all the things you have heard.
13Now reform your ways and your
actions and obey the Lord your God.
Then the Lord will relent and not bring
the disaster he has pronounced against
you.
14As for me, I am in your hands; do with
me whatever you think is good and right.
15Be assured, however, that if you put
me to death, you will bring the guilt of
innocent blood on yourselves and on
this city and on those who live in it, for in
truth the Lord has sent me to you to
speak all these words in your hearing."
16Then the officials and all the people
said to the priests and the prophets,
"This man should not be sentenced to
death! He has spoken to us in the name
of the Lord our God."
17Some of the elders of the land stepped
forward and said to the entire assembly
of people,
18"Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the
days of Hezekiah king of Judah. He told
all the people of Judah, 'This is what the
Lord Almighty says: " 'Zion will be
plowed like a field, Jerusalem will
become a heap of rubble, the temple hill
a mound overgrown with thickets.'
19"Did Hezekiah king of Judah or anyone
else in Judah put him to death? Did not
Hezekiah fear the Lord and seek his
favor? And did not the Lord relent, so
that he did not bring the disaster he
pronounced against them? We are
about to bring a terrible disaster on
ourselves!"
20(Now Uriah son of Shemaiah from
Kiriath Jearim was another man who
prophesied in the name of the Lord ; he
prophesied the same things against this
city and this land as Jeremiah did.
21When King Jehoiakim and all his
officers and officials heard his words,
the king sought to put him to death. But
Uriah heard of it and fled in fear to Egypt.
22King Jehoiakim, however, sent
Elnathan son of Acbor to Egypt, along
with some other men.
23They brought Uriah out of Egypt and
took him to King Jehoiakim, who had
him struck down with a sword and his
body thrown into the burial place of the
common people.)
24Furthermore, Ahikam son of Shaphan
supported Jeremiah, and so he was not
handed over to the people to be put to
death.
27Early in the reign of Zedekiah son
of Josiah king of Judah, this word came
to Jeremiah from the Lord :
2This is what the Lord said to me: "Make
a yoke out of straps and crossbars and
put it on your neck.
3Then send word to the kings of Edom,
Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon through
the envoys who have come to
Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.
4Give them a message for their masters
and say, 'This is what the Lord Almighty,
the God of Israel, says: "Tell this to your
masters:
5With my great power and outstretched
arm I made the earth and its people and
the animals that are on it, and I give it to
anyone I please.
6Now I will hand all your countries over
to my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon; I will make even the wild
animals subject to him.
7All nations will serve him and his son
and his grandson until the time for his
land comes; then many nations and
great kings will subjugate him.
8" ' "If, however, any nation or kingdom
will not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon or bow its neck under his yoke,
I will punish that nation with the sword,
famine and plague, declares the Lord ,
until I destroy it by his hand.
9So do not listen to your prophets, your
diviners, your interpreters of dreams,
your mediums or your sorcerers who tell
you, 'You will not serve the king of
Babylon.'
10They prophesy lies to you that will only
serve to remove you far from your lands;
I will banish you and you will perish.
11But if any nation will bow its neck
under the yoke of the king of Babylon
and serve him, I will let that nation
remain in its own land to till it and to live
there, declares the Lord ." ' "
12I gave the same message to Zedekiah
king of Judah. I said, "Bow your neck
under the yoke of the king of Babylon;
serve him and his people, and you will
live.
13Why will you and your people die by
the sword, famine and plague with
which the Lord has threatened any
nation that will not serve the king of
Babylon?
14Do not listen to the words of the
prophets who say to you, 'You will not
serve the king of Babylon,' for they are
prophesying lies to you.
15'I have not sent them,' declares the
Lord . 'They are prophesying lies in my
name. Therefore, I will banish you and
you will perish, both you and the
prophets who prophesy to you.' "
16Then I said to the priests and all these
people, "This is what the Lord says: Do
not listen to the prophets who say, 'Very
soon now the articles from the Lord 's
house will be brought back from
Babylon.' They are prophesying lies to
you.
17Do not listen to them. Serve the king of
Babylon, and you will live. Why should
this city become a ruin?
18If they are prophets and have the word
of the Lord , let them plead with the Lord
Almighty that the furnishings remaining
in the house of the Lord and in the
palace of the king of Judah and in
Jerusalem not be taken to Babylon.
19For this is what the Lord Almighty says
about the pillars, the Sea, the movable
stands and the other furnishings that are
left in this city,
20which Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon did not take away when he
carried Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim
king of Judah into exile from Jerusalem
to Babylon, along with all the nobles of
Judah and Jerusalem-
21yes, this is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says about the things that
are left in the house of the Lord and in
the palace of the king of Judah and in
Jerusalem:
22'They will be taken to Babylon and
there they will remain until the day I
come for them,' declares the Lord .
'Then I will bring them back and restore
them to this place.' "
28In the fifth month of that same
year, the fourth year, early in the reign
of Zedekiah king of Judah, the prophet
Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from
Gibeon, said to me in the house of the
Lord in the presence of the priests and
all the people:
2"This is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: 'I will break the yoke
of the king of Babylon.
3Within two years I will bring back to this
place all the articles of the Lord 's house
that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
removed from here and took to Babylon.
4I will also bring back to this place
Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of
Judah and all the other exiles from
Judah who went to Babylon,' declares
the Lord , 'for I will break the yoke of the
king of Babylon.' "
5Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to
the prophet Hananiah before the priests
and all the people who were standing in
the house of the Lord .
6He said, "Amen! May the Lord do so!
May the Lord fulfill the words you have
prophesied by bringing the articles of
the Lord 's house and all the exiles back
to this place from Babylon.
7Nevertheless, listen to what I have to
say in your hearing and in the hearing of
all the people:
8From early times the prophets who
preceded you and me have prophesied
war, disaster and plague against many
countries and great kingdoms.
9But the prophet who prophesies peace
will be recognized as one truly sent by
the Lord only if his prediction comes
true."
10Then the prophet Hananiah took the
yoke off the neck of the prophet
Jeremiah and broke it,
11and he said before all the people,
"This is what the Lord says: 'In the same
way will I break the yoke of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the
neck of all the nations within two years.'
" At this, the prophet Jeremiah went on
his way.
12Shortly after the prophet Hananiah had
broken the yoke off the neck of the
prophet Jeremiah, the word of the Lord
came to Jeremiah:
13"Go and tell Hananiah, 'This is what
the Lord says: You have broken a
wooden yoke, but in its place you will
get a yoke of iron.
14This is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: I will put an iron
yoke on the necks of all these nations to
make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon, and they will serve him. I will
even give him control over the wild
animals.' "
15Then the prophet Jeremiah said to
Hananiah the prophet, "Listen,
Hananiah! The Lord has not sent you,
yet you have persuaded this nation to
trust in lies.
16Therefore, this is what the Lord says: 'I
am about to remove you from the face
of the earth. This very year you are
going to die, because you have
preached rebellion against the Lord .' "
17In the seventh month of that same
year, Hananiah the prophet died.
29This is the text of the letter that
the prophet Jeremiah sent from
Jerusalem to the surviving elders among
the exiles and to the priests, the
prophets and all the other people
Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile
from Jerusalem to Babylon.
2(This was after King Jehoiachin and the
queen mother, the court officials and the
leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the
craftsmen and the artisans had gone
into exile from Jerusalem.)
3He entrusted the letter to Elasah son of
Shaphan and to Gemariah son of
Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah
sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in
Babylon. It said:
4This is what the Lord Almighty, the God
of Israel, says to all those I carried into
exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:
5"Build houses and settle down; plant
gardens and eat what they produce.
6Marry and have sons and daughters;
find wives for your sons and give your
daughters in marriage, so that they too
may have sons and daughters. Increase
in number there; do not decrease.
7Also, seek the peace and prosperity of
the city to which I have carried you into
exile. Pray to the Lord for it, because if it
prospers, you too will prosper."
8Yes, this is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: "Do not let the
prophets and diviners among you
deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams
you encourage them to have.
9They are prophesying lies to you in my
name. I have not sent them," declares
the Lord .
10This is what the Lord says: "When
seventy years are completed for
Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my
gracious promise to bring you back to
this place.
11For I know the plans I have for you,"
declares the Lord , "plans to prosper you
and not to harm you, plans to give you
hope and a future.
12Then you will call upon me and come
and pray to me, and I will listen to you.
13You will seek me and find me when
you seek me with all your heart.
14I will be found by you," declares the
Lord , "and will bring you back from
captivity. I will gather you from all the
nations and places where I have
banished you," declares the Lord , "and
will bring you back to the place from
which I carried you into exile."
15You may say, "The Lord has raised up
prophets for us in Babylon,"
16but this is what the Lord says about
the king who sits on David's throne and
all the people who remain in this city,
your countrymen who did not go with
you into exile-
17yes, this is what the Lord Almighty
says: "I will send the sword, famine and
plague against them and I will make
them like poor figs that are so bad they
cannot be eaten.
18I will pursue them with the sword,
famine and plague and will make them
abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the
earth and an object of cursing and
horror, of scorn and reproach, among all
the nations where I drive them.
19For they have not listened to my
words," declares the Lord , "words that I
sent to them again and again by my
servants the prophets. And you exiles
have not listened either," declares the
Lord .
20Therefore, hear the word of the Lord ,
all you exiles whom I have sent away
from Jerusalem to Babylon.
21This is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says about Ahab son of
Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah,
who are prophesying lies to you in my
name: "I will hand them over to
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and
he will put them to death before your
very eyes.
22Because of them, all the exiles from
Judah who are in Babylon will use this
curse: 'The Lord treat you like Zedekiah
and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon
burned in the fire.'
23For they have done outrageous things
in Israel; they have committed adultery
with their neighbors' wives and in my
name have spoken lies, which I did not
tell them to do. I know it and am a
witness to it," declares the Lord .
24Tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite,
25"This is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: You sent letters in
your own name to all the people in
Jerusalem, to Zephaniah son of
Maaseiah the priest, and to all the other
priests. You said to Zephaniah,
26'The Lord has appointed you priest in
place of Jehoiada to be in charge of the
house of the Lord ; you should put any
madman who acts like a prophet into the
stocks and neck-irons.
27So why have you not reprimanded
Jeremiah from Anathoth, who poses as
a prophet among you?
28He has sent this message to us in
Babylon: It will be a long time. Therefore
build houses and settle down; plant
gardens and eat what they produce.' "
29Zephaniah the priest, however, read
the letter to Jeremiah the prophet.
30Then the word of the Lord came to
Jeremiah:
31"Send this message to all the exiles:
'This is what the Lord says about
Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because
Shemaiah has prophesied to you, even
though I did not send him, and has led
you to believe a lie,
32this is what the Lord says: I will surely
punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and
his descendants. He will have no one
left among this people, nor will he see
the good things I will do for my people,
declares the Lord , because he has
preached rebellion against me.' "
30This is the word that came to
Jeremiah from the Lord :
2"This is what the Lord , the God of
Israel, says: 'Write in a book all the
words I have spoken to you.
3The days are coming,' declares the
Lord , 'when I will bring my people Israel
and Judah back from captivity and
restore them to the land I gave their
forefathers to possess,' says the Lord ."
4These are the words the Lord spoke
concerning Israel and Judah:
5"This is what the Lord says: " 'Cries of
fear are heard- terror, not peace.
6Ask and see: Can a man bear children?
Then why do I see every strong man
with his hands on his stomach like a
woman in labor, every face turned
deathly pale?
7How awful that day will be! None will be
like it. It will be a time of trouble for
Jacob, but he will be saved out of it.
8" 'In that day,' declares the Lord
Almighty, 'I will break the yoke off their
necks and will tear off their bonds; no
longer will foreigners enslave them.
9Instead, they will serve the Lord their
God and David their king, whom I will
raise up for them.
10" 'So do not fear, O Jacob my servant;
do not be dismayed, O Israel,' declares
the Lord . 'I will surely save you out of a
distant place, your descendants from
the land of their exile. Jacob will again
have peace and security, and no one
will make him afraid.
11I am with you and will save you,'
declares the Lord . 'Though I completely
destroy all the nations among which I
scatter you, I will not completely destroy
you. I will discipline you but only with
justice; I will not let you go entirely
unpunished.'
12"This is what the Lord says: " 'Your
wound is incurable, your injury beyond
healing.
13There is no one to plead your cause,
no remedy for your sore, no healing for
you.
14All your allies have forgotten you; they
care nothing for you. I have struck you
as an enemy would and punished you
as would the cruel, because your guilt is
so great and your sins so many.
15Why do you cry out over your wound,
your pain that has no cure? Because of
your great guilt and many sins I have
done these things to you.
16" 'But all who devour you will be
devoured; all your enemies will go into
exile. Those who plunder you will be
plundered; all who make spoil of you I
will despoil.
17But I will restore you to health and heal
your wounds,' declares the Lord ,
'because you are called an outcast, Zion
for whom no one cares.'
18"This is what the Lord says: " 'I will
restore the fortunes of Jacob's tents and
have compassion on his dwellings; the
city will be rebuilt on her ruins, and the
palace will stand in its proper place.
19From them will come songs of
thanksgiving and the sound of rejoicing.
I will add to their numbers, and they will
not be decreased; I will bring them
honor, and they will not be disdained.
20Their children will be as in days of old,
and their community will be established
before me; I will punish all who oppress
them.
21Their leader will be one of their own;
their ruler will arise from among them. I
will bring him near and he will come
close to me, for who is he who will
devote himself to be close to me?'
declares the Lord .
22" 'So you will be my people, and I will
be your God.' "
23See, the storm of the Lord will burst
out in wrath, a driving wind swirling
down on the heads of the wicked.
24The fierce anger of the Lord will not
turn back until he fully accomplishes the
purposes of his heart. In days to come
you will understand this.
31"At that time," declares the Lord ,
"I will be the God of all the clans of
Israel, and they will be my people."
2This is what the Lord says: "The people
who survive the sword will find favor in
the desert; I will come to give rest to
Israel."
3The Lord appeared to us in the past,
saying: "I have loved you with an
everlasting love; I have drawn you with
loving-kindness.
4I will build you up again and you will be
rebuilt, O Virgin Israel. Again you will
take up your tambourines and go out to
dance with the joyful.
5Again you will plant vineyards on the
hills of Samaria; the farmers will plant
them and enjoy their fruit.
6There will be a day when watchmen cry
out on the hills of Ephraim, 'Come, let us
go up to Zion, to the Lord our God.' "
7This is what the Lord says: "Sing with
joy for Jacob; shout for the foremost of
the nations. Make your praises heard,
and say, 'O Lord , save your people, the
remnant of Israel.'
8See, I will bring them from the land of
the north and gather them from the ends
of the earth. Among them will be the
blind and the lame, expectant mothers
and women in labor; a great throng will
return.
9They will come with weeping; they will
pray as I bring them back. I will lead
them beside streams of water on a level
path where they will not stumble,
because I am Israel's father, and
Ephraim is my firstborn son.
10"Hear the word of the Lord , O nations;
proclaim it in distant coastlands: 'He
who scattered Israel will gather them
and will watch over his flock like a
shepherd.'
11For the Lord will ransom Jacob and
redeem them from the hand of those
stronger than they.
12They will come and shout for joy on
the heights of Zion; they will rejoice in
the bounty of the Lord - the grain, the
new wine and the oil, the young of the
flocks and herds. They will be like a
well-watered garden, and they will
sorrow no more.
13Then maidens will dance and be glad,
young men and old as well. I will turn
their mourning into gladness; I will give
them comfort and joy instead of sorrow.
14I will satisfy the priests with abundance,
and my people will be filled with my
bounty," declares the Lord .
15This is what the Lord says: "A voice is
heard in Ramah, mourning and great
weeping, Rachel weeping for her
children and refusing to be comforted,
because her children are no more."
16This is what the Lord says: "Restrain
your voice from weeping and your eyes
from tears, for your work will be
rewarded," declares the Lord . "They will
return from the land of the enemy.
17So there is hope for your future,"
declares the Lord . "Your children will
return to their own land.
18"I have surely heard Ephraim's
moaning: 'You disciplined me like an
unruly calf, and I have been disciplined.
Restore me, and I will return, because
you are the Lord my God.
19After I strayed, I repented; after I came
to understand, I beat my breast. I was
ashamed and humiliated because I bore
the disgrace of my youth.'
20Is not Ephraim my dear son, the child
in whom I delight? Though I often speak
against him, I still remember him.
Therefore my heart yearns for him; I
have great compassion for him,"
declares the Lord .
21"Set up road signs; put up guideposts.
Take note of the highway, the road that
you take. Return, O Virgin Israel, return
to your towns.
22How long will you wander, O unfaithful
daughter? The Lord will create a new
thing on earth- a woman will surround a
man."
23This is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: "When I bring them
back from captivity, the people in the
land of Judah and in its towns will once
again use these words: 'The Lord bless
you, O righteous dwelling, O sacred
mountain.'
24People will live together in Judah and
all its towns-farmers and those who
move about with their flocks.
25I will refresh the weary and satisfy the
faint."
26At this I awoke and looked around. My
sleep had been pleasant to me.
27"The days are coming," declares the
Lord , "when I will plant the house of
Israel and the house of Judah with the
offspring of men and of animals.
28Just as I watched over them to uproot
and tear down, and to overthrow,
destroy and bring disaster, so I will
watch over them to build and to plant,"
declares the Lord .
29"In those days people will no longer
say, 'The fathers have eaten sour
grapes, and the children's teeth are set
on edge.'
30Instead, everyone will die for his own
sin; whoever eats sour grapes-his own
teeth will be set on edge.
31"The time is coming," declares the
Lord , "when I will make a new covenant
with the house of Israel and with the
house of Judah.
32It will not be like the covenant I made
with their forefathers when I took them
by the hand to lead them out of Egypt,
because they broke my covenant,
though I was a husband to them, "
declares the Lord .
33"This is the covenant I will make with
the house of Israel after that time,"
declares the Lord . "I will put my law in
their minds and write it on their hearts. I
will be their God, and they will be my
people.
34No longer will a man teach his
neighbor, or a man his brother, saying,
'Know the Lord ,' because they will all
know me, from the least of them to the
greatest," declares the Lord . "For I will
forgive their wickedness and will
remember their sins no more."
35This is what the Lord says, he who
appoints the sun to shine by day, who
decrees the moon and stars to shine by
night, who stirs up the sea so that its
waves roar- the Lord Almighty is his
name:
36"Only if these decrees vanish from my
sight," declares the Lord , "will the
descendants of Israel ever cease to be
a nation before me."
37This is what the Lord says: "Only if the
heavens above can be measured and
the foundations of the earth below be
searched out will I reject all the
descendants of Israel because of all
they have done," declares the Lord .
38"The days are coming," declares the
Lord , "when this city will be rebuilt for
me from the Tower of Hananel to the
Corner Gate.
39The measuring line will stretch from
there straight to the hill of Gareb and
then turn to Goah.
40The whole valley where dead bodies
and ashes are thrown, and all the
terraces out to the Kidron Valley on the
east as far as the corner of the Horse
Gate, will be holy to the Lord . The city
will never again be uprooted or
demolished."
32This is the word that came to
Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year
of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was
the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
2The army of the king of Babylon was
then besieging Jerusalem, and
Jeremiah the prophet was confined in
the courtyard of the guard in the royal
palace of Judah.
3Now Zedekiah king of Judah had
imprisoned him there, saying, "Why do
you prophesy as you do? You say, 'This
is what the Lord says: I am about to
hand this city over to the king of Babylon,
and he will capture it.
4Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape
out of the hands of the Babylonians but
will certainly be handed over to the king
of Babylon, and will speak with him face
to face and see him with his own eyes.
5He will take Zedekiah to Babylon,
where he will remain until I deal with him,
declares the Lord . If you fight against
the Babylonians, you will not succeed.' "
6Jeremiah said, "The word of the Lord
came to me:
7Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is
going to come to you and say, 'Buy my
field at Anathoth, because as nearest
relative it is your right and duty to buy it.'
8"Then, just as the Lord had said, my
cousin Hanamel came to me in the
courtyard of the guard and said, 'Buy my
field at Anathoth in the territory of
Benjamin. Since it is your right to
redeem it and possess it, buy it for
yourself.' "I knew that this was the word
of the Lord ;
9so I bought the field at Anathoth from
my cousin Hanamel and weighed out for
him seventeen shekels of silver.
10I signed and sealed the deed, had it
witnessed, and weighed out the silver
on the scales.
11I took the deed of purchase-the sealed
copy containing the terms and
conditions, as well as the unsealed
copy-
12and I gave this deed to Baruch son of
Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the
presence of my cousin Hanamel and of
the witnesses who had signed the deed
and of all the Jews sitting in the
courtyard of the guard.
13"In their presence I gave Baruch these
instructions:
14'This is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: Take these
documents, both the sealed and
unsealed copies of the deed of
purchase, and put them in a clay jar so
they will last a long time.
15For this is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: Houses, fields and
vineyards will again be bought in this
land.'
16"After I had given the deed of
purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I
prayed to the Lord :
17"Ah, Sovereign Lord , you have made
the heavens and the earth by your great
power and outstretched arm. Nothing is
too hard for you.
18You show love to thousands but bring
the punishment for the fathers' sins into
the laps of their children after them. O
great and powerful God, whose name is
the Lord Almighty,
19great are your purposes and mighty
are your deeds. Your eyes are open to
all the ways of men; you reward
everyone according to his conduct and
as his deeds deserve.
20You performed miraculous signs and
wonders in Egypt and have continued
them to this day, both in Israel and
among all mankind, and have gained
the renown that is still yours.
21You brought your people Israel out of
Egypt with signs and wonders, by a
mighty hand and an outstretched arm
and with great terror.
22You gave them this land you had
sworn to give their forefathers, a land
flowing with milk and honey.
23They came in and took possession of
it, but they did not obey you or follow
your law; they did not do what you
commanded them to do. So you brought
all this disaster upon them.
24"See how the siege ramps are built up
to take the city. Because of the sword,
famine and plague, the city will be
handed over to the Babylonians who are
attacking it. What you said has
happened, as you now see.
25And though the city will be handed
over to the Babylonians, you, O
Sovereign Lord , say to me, 'Buy the
field with silver and have the transaction
witnessed.' "
26Then the word of the Lord came to
Jeremiah:
27"I am the Lord , the God of all mankind.
Is anything too hard for me?
28Therefore, this is what the Lord says: I
am about to hand this city over to the
Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon, who will capture it.
29The Babylonians who are attacking
this city will come in and set it on fire;
they will burn it down, along with the
houses where the people provoked me
to anger by burning incense on the roofs
to Baal and by pouring out drink
offerings to other gods.
30"The people of Israel and Judah have
done nothing but evil in my sight from
their youth; indeed, the people of Israel
have done nothing but provoke me with
what their hands have made, declares
the Lord .
31From the day it was built until now, this
city has so aroused my anger and wrath
that I must remove it from my sight.
32The people of Israel and Judah have
provoked me by all the evil they have
done-they, their kings and officials, their
priests and prophets, the men of Judah
and the people of Jerusalem.
33They turned their backs to me and not
their faces; though I taught them again
and again, they would not listen or
respond to discipline.
34They set up their abominable idols in
the house that bears my Name and
defiled it.
35They built high places for Baal in the
Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their
sons and daughters to Molech, though I
never commanded, nor did it enter my
mind, that they should do such a
detestable thing and so make Judah sin.
36"You are saying about this city, 'By the
sword, famine and plague it will be
handed over to the king of Babylon'; but
this is what the Lord , the God of Israel,
says:
37I will surely gather them from all the
lands where I banish them in my furious
anger and great wrath; I will bring them
back to this place and let them live in
safety.
38They will be my people, and I will be
their God.
39I will give them singleness of heart and
action, so that they will always fear me
for their own good and the good of their
children after them.
40I will make an everlasting covenant
with them: I will never stop doing good
to them, and I will inspire them to fear
me, so that they will never turn away
from me.
41I will rejoice in doing them good and
will assuredly plant them in this land
with all my heart and soul.
42"This is what the Lord says: As I have
brought all this great calamity on this
people, so I will give them all the
prosperity I have promised them.
43Once more fields will be bought in this
land of which you say, 'It is a desolate
waste, without men or animals, for it has
been handed over to the Babylonians.'
44Fields will be bought for silver, and
deeds will be signed, sealed and
witnessed in the territory of Benjamin, in
the villages around Jerusalem, in the
towns of Judah and in the towns of the
hill country, of the western foothills and
of the Negev, because I will restore their
fortunes, declares the Lord ."
33While Jeremiah was still confined
in the courtyard of the guard, the word
of the Lord came to him a second time:
2"This is what the Lord says, he who
made the earth, the Lord who formed it
and established it-the Lord is his name:
3'Call to me and I will answer you and
tell you great and unsearchable things
you do not know.'
4For this is what the Lord , the God of
Israel, says about the houses in this city
and the royal palaces of Judah that
have been torn down to be used against
the siege ramps and the sword
5in the fight with the Babylonians : 'They
will be filled with the dead bodies of the
men I will slay in my anger and wrath. I
will hide my face from this city because
of all its wickedness.
6" 'Nevertheless, I will bring health and
healing to it; I will heal my people and
will let them enjoy abundant peace and
security.
7I will bring Judah and Israel back from
captivity and will rebuild them as they
were before.
8I will cleanse them from all the sin they
have committed against me and will
forgive all their sins of rebellion against
me.
9Then this city will bring me renown, joy,
praise and honor before all nations on
earth that hear of all the good things I do
for it; and they will be in awe and will
tremble at the abundant prosperity and
peace I provide for it.'
10"This is what the Lord says: 'You say
about this place, "It is a desolate waste,
without men or animals." Yet in the
towns of Judah and the streets of
Jerusalem that are deserted, inhabited
by neither men nor animals, there will be
heard once more
11the sounds of joy and gladness, the
voices of bride and bridegroom, and the
voices of those who bring thank
offerings to the house of the Lord ,
saying, "Give thanks to the Lord
Almighty, for the Lord is good; his love
endures forever." For I will restore the
fortunes of the land as they were
before,' says the Lord .
12"This is what the Lord Almighty says:
'In this place, desolate and without men
or animals-in all its towns there will
again be pastures for shepherds to rest
their flocks.
13In the towns of the hill country, of the
western foothills and of the Negev, in
the territory of Benjamin, in the villages
around Jerusalem and in the towns of
Judah, flocks will again pass under the
hand of the one who counts them,' says
the Lord .
14" 'The days are coming,' declares the
Lord , 'when I will fulfill the gracious
promise I made to the house of Israel
and to the house of Judah.
15" 'In those days and at that time I will
make a righteous Branch sprout from
David's line; he will do what is just and
right in the land.
16In those days Judah will be saved and
Jerusalem will live in safety. This is the
name by which it will be called: The Lord
Our Righteousness.'
17For this is what the Lord says: 'David
will never fail to have a man to sit on the
throne of the house of Israel,
18nor will the priests, who are Levites,
ever fail to have a man to stand before
me continually to offer burnt offerings, to
burn grain offerings and to present
sacrifices.' "
19The word of the Lord came to
Jeremiah:
20"This is what the Lord says: 'If you can
break my covenant with the day and my
covenant with the night, so that day and
night no longer come at their appointed
time,
21then my covenant with David my
servant-and my covenant with the
Levites who are priests ministering
before me-can be broken and David will
no longer have a descendant to reign on
his throne.
22I will make the descendants of David
my servant and the Levites who minister
before me as countless as the stars of
the sky and as measureless as the sand
on the seashore.' "
23The word of the Lord came to
Jeremiah:
24"Have you not noticed that these
people are saying, 'The Lord has
rejected the two kingdoms he chose'?
So they despise my people and no
longer regard them as a nation.
25This is what the Lord says: 'If I have
not established my covenant with day
and night and the fixed laws of heaven
and earth,
26then I will reject the descendants of
Jacob and David my servant and will not
choose one of his sons to rule over the
descendants of Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes
and have compassion on them.' "
34While Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon and all his army and all the
kingdoms and peoples in the empire he
ruled were fighting against Jerusalem
and all its surrounding towns, this word
came to Jeremiah from the Lord :
2"This is what the Lord , the God of
Israel, says: Go to Zedekiah king of
Judah and tell him, 'This is what the
Lord says: I am about to hand this city
over to the king of Babylon, and he will
burn it down.
3You will not escape from his grasp but
will surely be captured and handed over
to him. You will see the king of Babylon
with your own eyes, and he will speak
with you face to face. And you will go to
Babylon.
4" 'Yet hear the promise of the Lord , O
Zedekiah king of Judah. This is what the
Lord says concerning you: You will not
die by the sword;
5you will die peacefully. As people made
a funeral fire in honor of your fathers,
the former kings who preceded you, so
they will make a fire in your honor and
lament, "Alas, O master!" I myself make
this promise, declares the Lord .' "
6Then Jeremiah the prophet told all this
to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,
7while the army of the king of Babylon
was fighting against Jerusalem and the
other cities of Judah that were still
holding out-Lachish and Azekah. These
were the only fortified cities left in Judah.
8The word came to Jeremiah from the
Lord after King Zedekiah had made a
covenant with all the people in
Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the
slaves.
9Everyone was to free his Hebrew
slaves, both male and female; no one
was to hold a fellow Jew in bondage.
10So all the officials and people who
entered into this covenant agreed that
they would free their male and female
slaves and no longer hold them in
bondage. They agreed, and set them
free.
11But afterward they changed their
minds and took back the slaves they
had freed and enslaved them again.
12Then the word of the Lord came to
Jeremiah:
13"This is what the Lord , the God of
Israel, says: I made a covenant with
your forefathers when I brought them
out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I
said,
14'Every seventh year each of you must
free any fellow Hebrew who has sold
himself to you. After he has served you
six years, you must let him go free.'
Your fathers, however, did not listen to
me or pay attention to me.
15Recently you repented and did what is
right in my sight: Each of you
proclaimed freedom to his countrymen.
You even made a covenant before me
in the house that bears my Name.
16But now you have turned around and
profaned my name; each of you has
taken back the male and female slaves
you had set free to go where they
wished. You have forced them to
become your slaves again.
17"Therefore, this is what the Lord says:
You have not obeyed me; you have not
proclaimed freedom for your fellow
countrymen. So I now proclaim
'freedom' for you, declares the Lord -
'freedom' to fall by the sword, plague
and famine. I will make you abhorrent to
all the kingdoms of the earth.
18The men who have violated my
covenant and have not fulfilled the terms
of the covenant they made before me, I
will treat like the calf they cut in two and
then walked between its pieces.
19The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem,
the court officials, the priests and all the
people of the land who walked between
the pieces of the calf,
20I will hand over to their enemies who
seek their lives. Their dead bodies will
become food for the birds of the air and
the beasts of the earth.
21"I will hand Zedekiah king of Judah
and his officials over to their enemies
who seek their lives, to the army of the
king of Babylon, which has withdrawn
from you.
22I am going to give the order, declares
the Lord , and I will bring them back to
this city. They will fight against it, take it
and burn it down. And I will lay waste
the towns of Judah so no one can live
there."
35This is the word that came to
Jeremiah from the Lord during the reign
of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of
Judah:
2"Go to the Recabite family and invite
them to come to one of the side rooms
of the house of the Lord and give them
wine to drink."
3So I went to get Jaazaniah son of
Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and
his brothers and all his sons-the whole
family of the Recabites.
4I brought them into the house of the
Lord , into the room of the sons of
Hanan son of Igdaliah the man of God.
It was next to the room of the officials,
which was over that of Maaseiah son of
Shallum the doorkeeper.
5Then I set bowls full of wine and some
cups before the men of the Recabite
family and said to them, "Drink some
wine."
6But they replied, "We do not drink wine,
because our forefather Jonadab son of
Recab gave us this command: 'Neither
you nor your descendants must ever
drink wine.
7Also you must never build houses, sow
seed or plant vineyards; you must never
have any of these things, but must
always live in tents. Then you will live a
long time in the land where you are
nomads.'
8We have obeyed everything our
forefather Jonadab son of Recab
commanded us. Neither we nor our
wives nor our sons and daughters have
ever drunk wine
9or built houses to live in or had
vineyards, fields or crops.
10We have lived in tents and have fully
obeyed everything our forefather
Jonadab commanded us.
11But when Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon invaded this land, we said,
'Come, we must go to Jerusalem to
escape the Babylonian and Aramean
armies.' So we have remained in
Jerusalem."
12Then the word of the Lord came to
Jeremiah, saying:
13"This is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: Go and tell the men
of Judah and the people of Jerusalem,
'Will you not learn a lesson and obey my
words?' declares the Lord .
14'Jonadab son of Recab ordered his
sons not to drink wine and this
command has been kept. To this day
they do not drink wine, because they
obey their forefather's command. But I
have spoken to you again and again, yet
you have not obeyed me.
15Again and again I sent all my servants
the prophets to you. They said, "Each of
you must turn from your wicked ways
and reform your actions; do not follow
other gods to serve them. Then you will
live in the land I have given to you and
your fathers." But you have not paid
attention or listened to me.
16The descendants of Jonadab son of
Recab have carried out the command
their forefather gave them, but these
people have not obeyed me.'
17"Therefore, this is what the Lord God
Almighty, the God of Israel, says:
'Listen! I am going to bring on Judah
and on everyone living in Jerusalem
every disaster I pronounced against
them. I spoke to them, but they did not
listen; I called to them, but they did not
answer.' "
18Then Jeremiah said to the family of the
Recabites, "This is what the Lord
Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'You
have obeyed the command of your
forefather Jonadab and have followed
all his instructions and have done
everything he ordered.'
19Therefore, this is what the Lord
Almighty, the God of Israel, says:
'Jonadab son of Recab will never fail to
have a man to serve me.' "
36In the fourth year of Jehoiakim
son of Josiah king of Judah, this word
came to Jeremiah from the Lord :
2"Take a scroll and write on it all the
words I have spoken to you concerning
Israel, Judah and all the other nations
from the time I began speaking to you in
the reign of Josiah till now.
3Perhaps when the people of Judah
hear about every disaster I plan to inflict
on them, each of them will turn from his
wicked way; then I will forgive their
wickedness and their sin."
4So Jeremiah called Baruch son of
Neriah, and while Jeremiah dictated all
the words the Lord had spoken to him,
Baruch wrote them on the scroll.
5Then Jeremiah told Baruch, "I am
restricted; I cannot go to the Lord 's
temple.
6So you go to the house of the Lord on a
day of fasting and read to the people
from the scroll the words of the Lord that
you wrote as I dictated. Read them to all
the people of Judah who come in from
their towns.
7Perhaps they will bring their petition
before the Lord , and each will turn from
his wicked ways, for the anger and
wrath pronounced against this people by
the Lord are great."
8Baruch son of Neriah did everything
Jeremiah the prophet told him to do; at
the Lord 's temple he read the words of
the Lord from the scroll.
9In the ninth month of the fifth year of
Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah,
a time of fasting before the Lord was
proclaimed for all the people in
Jerusalem and those who had come
from the towns of Judah.
10From the room of Gemariah son of
Shaphan the secretary, which was in the
upper courtyard at the entrance of the
New Gate of the temple, Baruch read to
all the people at the Lord 's temple the
words of Jeremiah from the scroll.
11When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the
son of Shaphan, heard all the words of
the Lord from the scroll,
12he went down to the secretary's room
in the royal palace, where all the officials
were sitting: Elishama the secretary,
Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son
of Acbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan,
Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the
other officials.
13After Micaiah told them everything he
had heard Baruch read to the people
from the scroll,
14all the officials sent Jehudi son of
Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the
son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, "Bring
the scroll from which you have read to
the people and come." So Baruch son of
Neriah went to them with the scroll in his
hand.
15They said to him, "Sit down, please,
and read it to us." So Baruch read it to
them.
16When they heard all these words, they
looked at each other in fear and said to
Baruch, "We must report all these words
to the king."
17Then they asked Baruch, "Tell us, how
did you come to write all this? Did
Jeremiah dictate it?"
18"Yes," Baruch replied, "he dictated all
these words to me, and I wrote them in
ink on the scroll."
19Then the officials said to Baruch, "You
and Jeremiah, go and hide. Don't let
anyone know where you are."
20After they put the scroll in the room of
Elishama the secretary, they went to the
king in the courtyard and reported
everything to him.
21The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll,
and Jehudi brought it from the room of
Elishama the secretary and read it to the
king and all the officials standing beside
him.
22It was the ninth month and the king
was sitting in the winter apartment, with
a fire burning in the firepot in front of him.
23Whenever Jehudi had read three or
four columns of the scroll, the king cut
them off with a scribe's knife and threw
them into the firepot, until the entire
scroll was burned in the fire.
24The king and all his attendants who
heard all these words showed no fear,
nor did they tear their clothes.
25Even though Elnathan, Delaiah and
Gemariah urged the king not to burn the
scroll, he would not listen to them.
26Instead, the king commanded
Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah
son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of
Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and
Jeremiah the prophet. But the Lord had
hidden them.
27After the king burned the scroll
containing the words that Baruch had
written at Jeremiah's dictation, the word
of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
28"Take another scroll and write on it all
the words that were on the first scroll,
which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned
up.
29Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, 'This
is what the Lord says: You burned that
scroll and said, "Why did you write on it
that the king of Babylon would certainly
come and destroy this land and cut off
both men and animals from it?"
30Therefore, this is what the Lord says
about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will
have no one to sit on the throne of
David; his body will be thrown out and
exposed to the heat by day and the frost
by night.
31I will punish him and his children and
his attendants for their wickedness; I will
bring on them and those living in
Jerusalem and the people of Judah
every disaster I pronounced against
them, because they have not listened.' "
32So Jeremiah took another scroll and
gave it to the scribe Baruch son of
Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated,
Baruch wrote on it all the words of the
scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had
burned in the fire. And many similar
words were added to them.
37Zedekiah son of Josiah was made
king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon; he reigned in place of
Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim.
2Neither he nor his attendants nor the
people of the land paid any attention to
the words the Lord had spoken through
Jeremiah the prophet.
3King Zedekiah, however, sent Jehucal
son of Shelemiah with the priest
Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah
the prophet with this message: "Please
pray to the Lord our God for us."
4Now Jeremiah was free to come and go
among the people, for he had not yet
been put in prison.
5Pharaoh's army had marched out of
Egypt, and when the Babylonians who
were besieging Jerusalem heard the
report about them, they withdrew from
Jerusalem.
6Then the word of the Lord came to
Jeremiah the prophet:
7"This is what the Lord , the God of
Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah, who
sent you to inquire of me, 'Pharaoh's
army, which has marched out to support
you, will go back to its own land, to
Egypt.
8Then the Babylonians will return and
attack this city; they will capture it and
burn it down.'
9"This is what the Lord says: Do not
deceive yourselves, thinking, 'The
Babylonians will surely leave us.' They
will not!
10Even if you were to defeat the entire
Babylonian army that is attacking you
and only wounded men were left in their
tents, they would come out and burn this
city down."
11After the Babylonian army had
withdrawn from Jerusalem because of
Pharaoh's army,
12Jeremiah started to leave the city to go
to the territory of Benjamin to get his
share of the property among the people
there.
13But when he reached the Benjamin
Gate, the captain of the guard, whose
name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the
son of Hananiah, arrested him and said,
"You are deserting to the Babylonians!"
14"That's not true!" Jeremiah said. "I am
not deserting to the Babylonians." But
Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he
arrested Jeremiah and brought him to
the officials.
15They were angry with Jeremiah and
had him beaten and imprisoned in the
house of Jonathan the secretary, which
they had made into a prison.
16Jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in
a dungeon, where he remained a long
time.
17Then King Zedekiah sent for him and
had him brought to the palace, where he
asked him privately, "Is there any word
from the Lord ?" "Yes," Jeremiah replied,
"you will be handed over to the king of
Babylon."
18Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah,
"What crime have I committed against
you or your officials or this people, that
you have put me in prison?
19Where are your prophets who
prophesied to you, 'The king of Babylon
will not attack you or this land'?
20But now, my lord the king, please
listen. Let me bring my petition before
you: Do not send me back to the house
of Jonathan the secretary, or I will die
there."
21King Zedekiah then gave orders for
Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard
of the guard and given bread from the
street of the bakers each day until all the
bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah
remained in the courtyard of the guard.
38Shephatiah son of Mattan,
Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal son
of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of
Malkijah heard what Jeremiah was
telling all the people when he said,
2"This is what the Lord says: 'Whoever
stays in this city will die by the sword,
famine or plague, but whoever goes
over to the Babylonians will live. He will
escape with his life; he will live.'
3And this is what the Lord says: 'This
city will certainly be handed over to the
army of the king of Babylon, who will
capture it.' "
4Then the officials said to the king, "This
man should be put to death. He is
discouraging the soldiers who are left in
this city, as well as all the people, by the
things he is saying to them. This man is
not seeking the good of these people
but their ruin."
5"He is in your hands," King Zedekiah
answered. "The king can do nothing to
oppose you."
6So they took Jeremiah and put him into
the cistern of Malkijah, the king's son,
which was in the courtyard of the guard.
They lowered Jeremiah by ropes into
the cistern; it had no water in it, only
mud, and Jeremiah sank down into the
mud.
7But Ebed-Melech, a Cushite, an official
in the royal palace, heard that they had
put Jeremiah into the cistern. While the
king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate,
8Ebed-Melech went out of the palace
and said to him,
9"My lord the king, these men have
acted wickedly in all they have done to
Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown
him into a cistern, where he will starve
to death when there is no longer any
bread in the city."
10Then the king commanded Ebed-
Melech the Cushite, "Take thirty men
from here with you and lift Jeremiah the
prophet out of the cistern before he
dies."
11So Ebed-Melech took the men with
him and went to a room under the
treasury in the palace. He took some old
rags and worn-out clothes from there
and let them down with ropes to
Jeremiah in the cistern.
12Ebed-Melech the Cushite said to
Jeremiah, "Put these old rags and wornout
clothes under your arms to pad the
ropes." Jeremiah did so,
13and they pulled him up with the ropes
and lifted him out of the cistern. And
Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of
the guard.
14Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah
the prophet and had him brought to the
third entrance to the temple of the Lord .
"I am going to ask you something," the
king said to Jeremiah. "Do not hide
anything from me."
15Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I give
you an answer, will you not kill me?
Even if I did give you counsel, you
would not listen to me."
16But King Zedekiah swore this oath
secretly to Jeremiah: "As surely as the
Lord lives, who has given us breath, I
will neither kill you nor hand you over to
those who are seeking your life."
17Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "This
is what the Lord God Almighty, the God
of Israel, says: 'If you surrender to the
officers of the king of Babylon, your life
will be spared and this city will not be
burned down; you and your family will
live.
18But if you will not surrender to the
officers of the king of Babylon, this city
will be handed over to the Babylonians
and they will burn it down; you yourself
will not escape from their hands.' "
19King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I am
afraid of the Jews who have gone over
to the Babylonians, for the Babylonians
may hand me over to them and they will
mistreat me."
20"They will not hand you over,"
Jeremiah replied. "Obey the Lord by
doing what I tell you. Then it will go well
with you, and your life will be spared.
21But if you refuse to surrender, this is
what the Lord has revealed to me:
22All the women left in the palace of the
king of Judah will be brought out to the
officials of the king of Babylon. Those
women will say to you: " 'They misled
you and overcame you- those trusted
friends of yours. Your feet are sunk in
the mud; your friends have deserted
you.'
23"All your wives and children will be
brought out to the Babylonians. You
yourself will not escape from their hands
but will be captured by the king of
Babylon; and this city will be burned
down."
24Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Do
not let anyone know about this
conversation, or you may die.
25If the officials hear that I talked with
you, and they come to you and say, 'Tell
us what you said to the king and what
the king said to you; do not hide it from
us or we will kill you,'
26then tell them, 'I was pleading with the
king not to send me back to Jonathan's
house to die there.' "
27All the officials did come to Jeremiah
and question him, and he told them
everything the king had ordered him to
say. So they said no more to him, for no
one had heard his conversation with the
king.
28And Jeremiah remained in the
courtyard of the guard until the day
Jerusalem was captured.
39This is how Jerusalem was taken:
In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of
Judah, in the tenth month,
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
marched against Jerusalem with his
whole army and laid siege to it.
2And on the ninth day of the fourth
month of Zedekiah's eleventh year, the
city wall was broken through.
3Then all the officials of the king of
Babylon came and took seats in the
Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer of
Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim a chief officer,
Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all
the other officials of the king of Babylon.
4When Zedekiah king of Judah and all
the soldiers saw them, they fled; they
left the city at night by way of the king's
garden, through the gate between the
two walls, and headed toward the
Arabah.
5But the Babylonian army pursued them
and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of
Jericho. They captured him and took
him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where
he pronounced sentence on him.
6There at Riblah the king of Babylon
slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before
his eyes and also killed all the nobles of
Judah.
7Then he put out Zedekiah's eyes and
bound him with bronze shackles to take
him to Babylon.
8The Babylonians set fire to the royal
palace and the houses of the people
and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
9Nebuzaradan commander of the
imperial guard carried into exile to
Babylon the people who remained in the
city, along with those who had gone
over to him, and the rest of the people.
10But Nebuzaradan the commander of
the guard left behind in the land of
Judah some of the poor people, who
owned nothing; and at that time he gave
them vineyards and fields.
11Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
had given these orders about Jeremiah
through Nebuzaradan commander of
the imperial guard:
12"Take him and look after him; don't
harm him but do for him whatever he
asks."
13So Nebuzaradan the commander of
the guard, Nebushazban a chief officer,
Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all
the other officers of the king of Babylon
14sent and had Jeremiah taken out of
the courtyard of the guard. They turned
him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the
son of Shaphan, to take him back to his
home. So he remained among his own
people.
15While Jeremiah had been confined in
the courtyard of the guard, the word of
the Lord came to him:
16"Go and tell Ebed-Melech the Cushite,
'This is what the Lord Almighty, the God
of Israel, says: I am about to fulfill my
words against this city through disaster,
not prosperity. At that time they will be
fulfilled before your eyes.
17But I will rescue you on that day,
declares the Lord ; you will not be
handed over to those you fear.
18I will save you; you will not fall by the
sword but will escape with your life,
because you trust in me, declares the
Lord .' "
40The word came to Jeremiah from
the Lord after Nebuzaradan commander
of the imperial guard had released him
at Ramah. He had found Jeremiah
bound in chains among all the captives
from Jerusalem and Judah who were
being carried into exile to Babylon.
2When the commander of the guard
found Jeremiah, he said to him, "The
Lord your God decreed this disaster for
this place.
3And now the Lord has brought it about;
he has done just as he said he would.
All this happened because you people
sinned against the Lord and did not
obey him.
4But today I am freeing you from the
chains on your wrists. Come with me to
Babylon, if you like, and I will look after
you; but if you do not want to, then don't
come. Look, the whole country lies
before you; go wherever you please."
5However, before Jeremiah turned to go,
Nebuzaradan added, "Go back to
Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of
Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has
appointed over the towns of Judah, and
live with him among the people, or go
anywhere else you please." Then the
commander gave him provisions and a
present and let him go.
6So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of
Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him
among the people who were left behind
in the land.
7When all the army officers and their
men who were still in the open country
heard that the king of Babylon had
appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as
governor over the land and had put him
in charge of the men, women and
children who were the poorest in the
land and who had not been carried into
exile to Babylon,
8they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah-
Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and
Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah
son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai
the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son
of the Maacathite, and their men.
9Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of
Shaphan, took an oath to reassure them
and their men. "Do not be afraid to serve
the Babylonians, " he said. "Settle down
in the land and serve the king of
Babylon, and it will go well with you.
10I myself will stay at Mizpah to
represent you before the Babylonians
who come to us, but you are to harvest
the wine, summer fruit and oil, and put
them in your storage jars, and live in the
towns you have taken over."
11When all the Jews in Moab, Ammon,
Edom and all the other countries heard
that the king of Babylon had left a
remnant in Judah and had appointed
Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of
Shaphan, as governor over them,
12they all came back to the land of
Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, from all
the countries where they had been
scattered. And they harvested an
abundance of wine and summer fruit.
13Johanan son of Kareah and all the
army officers still in the open country
came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
14and said to him, "Don't you know that
Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent
Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your
life?" But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did
not believe them.
15Then Johanan son of Kareah said
privately to Gedaliah in Mizpah, "Let me
go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah,
and no one will know it. Why should he
take your life and cause all the Jews
who are gathered around you to be
scattered and the remnant of Judah to
perish?"
16But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to
Johanan son of Kareah, "Don't do such
a thing! What you are saying about
Ishmael is not true."
41In the seventh month Ishmael son
of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who
was of royal blood and had been one of
the king's officers, came with ten men to
Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah.
While they were eating together there,
2Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten
men who were with him got up and
struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam,
the son of Shaphan, with the sword,
killing the one whom the king of Babylon
had appointed as governor over the land.
3Ishmael also killed all the Jews who
were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well
as the Babylonian soldiers who were
there.
4The day after Gedaliah's assassination,
before anyone knew about it,
5eighty men who had shaved off their
beards, torn their clothes and cut
themselves came from Shechem, Shiloh
and Samaria, bringing grain offerings
and incense with them to the house of
the Lord .
6Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out
from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as
he went. When he met them, he said,
"Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam."
7When they went into the city, Ishmael
son of Nethaniah and the men who were
with him slaughtered them and threw
them into a cistern.
8But ten of them said to Ishmael, "Don't
kill us! We have wheat and barley, oil
and honey, hidden in a field." So he let
them alone and did not kill them with the
others.
9Now the cistern where he threw all the
bodies of the men he had killed along
with Gedaliah was the one King Asa had
made as part of his defense against
Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of
Nethaniah filled it with the dead.
10Ishmael made captives of all the rest
of the people who were in Mizpah-the
king's daughters along with all the
others who were left there, over whom
Nebuzaradan commander of the
imperial guard had appointed Gedaliah
son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of
Nethaniah took them captive and set out
to cross over to the Ammonites.
11When Johanan son of Kareah and all
the army officers who were with him
heard about all the crimes Ishmael son
of Nethaniah had committed,
12they took all their men and went to
fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They
caught up with him near the great pool
in Gibeon.
13When all the people Ishmael had with
him saw Johanan son of Kareah and the
army officers who were with him, they
were glad.
14All the people Ishmael had taken
captive at Mizpah turned and went over
to Johanan son of Kareah.
15But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and
eight of his men escaped from Johanan
and fled to the Ammonites.
16Then Johanan son of Kareah and all
the army officers who were with him led
away all the survivors from Mizpah
whom he had recovered from Ishmael
son of Nethaniah after he had
assassinated Gedaliah son of Ahikam:
the soldiers, women, children and court
officials he had brought from Gibeon.
17And they went on, stopping at Geruth
Kimham near Bethlehem on their way to
Egypt
18to escape the Babylonians. They were
afraid of them because Ishmael son of
Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of
Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had
appointed as governor over the land.
42Then all the army officers,
including Johanan son of Kareah and
Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the
people from the least to the greatest
approached
2Jeremiah the prophet and said to him,
"Please hear our petition and pray to the
Lord your God for this entire remnant.
For as you now see, though we were
once many, now only a few are left.
3Pray that the Lord your God will tell us
where we should go and what we
should do."
4"I have heard you," replied Jeremiah
the prophet. "I will certainly pray to the
Lord your God as you have requested; I
will tell you everything the Lord says and
will keep nothing back from you."
5Then they said to Jeremiah, "May the
Lord be a true and faithful witness
against us if we do not act in
accordance with everything the Lord
your God sends you to tell us.
6Whether it is favorable or unfavorable,
we will obey the Lord our God, to whom
we are sending you, so that it will go
well with us, for we will obey the Lord
our God."
7Ten days later the word of the Lord
came to Jeremiah.
8So he called together Johanan son of
Kareah and all the army officers who
were with him and all the people from
the least to the greatest.
9He said to them, "This is what the Lord ,
the God of Israel, to whom you sent me
to present your petition, says:
10'If you stay in this land, I will build you
up and not tear you down; I will plant
you and not uproot you, for I am grieved
over the disaster I have inflicted on you.
11Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon,
whom you now fear. Do not be afraid of
him, declares the Lord , for I am with
you and will save you and deliver you
from his hands.
12I will show you compassion so that he
will have compassion on you and
restore you to your land.'
13"However, if you say, 'We will not stay
in this land,' and so disobey the Lord
your God,
14and if you say, 'No, we will go and live
in Egypt, where we will not see war or
hear the trumpet or be hungry for bread,'
15then hear the word of the Lord , O
remnant of Judah. This is what the Lord
Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'If you
are determined to go to Egypt and you
do go to settle there,
16then the sword you fear will overtake
you there, and the famine you dread will
follow you into Egypt, and there you will
die.
17Indeed, all who are determined to go
to Egypt to settle there will die by the
sword, famine and plague; not one of
them will survive or escape the disaster
I will bring on them.'
18This is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: 'As my anger and
wrath have been poured out on those
who lived in Jerusalem, so will my wrath
be poured out on you when you go to
Egypt. You will be an object of cursing
and horror, of condemnation and
reproach; you will never see this place
again.'
19"O remnant of Judah, the Lord has told
you, 'Do not go to Egypt.' Be sure of
this: I warn you today
20that you made a fatal mistake when
you sent me to the Lord your God and
said, 'Pray to the Lord our God for us;
tell us everything he says and we will do
it.'
21I have told you today, but you still have
not obeyed the Lord your God in all he
sent me to tell you.
22So now, be sure of this: You will die by
the sword, famine and plague in the
place where you want to go to settle."
43When Jeremiah finished telling the
people all the words of the Lord their
God-everything the Lord had sent him to
tell them-
2Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan
son of Kareah and all the arrogant men
said to Jeremiah, "You are lying! The
Lord our God has not sent you to say,
'You must not go to Egypt to settle
there.'
3But Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you
against us to hand us over to the
Babylonians, so they may kill us or carry
us into exile to Babylon."
4So Johanan son of Kareah and all the
army officers and all the people
disobeyed the Lord 's command to stay
in the land of Judah.
5Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all
the army officers led away all the
remnant of Judah who had come back
to live in the land of Judah from all the
nations where they had been scattered.
6They also led away all the men, women
and children and the king's daughters
whom Nebuzaradan commander of the
imperial guard had left with Gedaliah
son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and
Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of
Neriah.
7So they entered Egypt in disobedience
to the Lord and went as far as
Tahpanhes.
8In Tahpanhes the word of the Lord
came to Jeremiah:
9"While the Jews are watching, take
some large stones with you and bury
them in clay in the brick pavement at the
entrance to Pharaoh's palace in
Tahpanhes.
10Then say to them, 'This is what the
Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I
will send for my servant
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I
will set his throne over these stones I
have buried here; he will spread his
royal canopy above them.
11He will come and attack Egypt,
bringing death to those destined for
death, captivity to those destined for
captivity, and the sword to those
destined for the sword.
12He will set fire to the temples of the
gods of Egypt; he will burn their temples
and take their gods captive. As a
shepherd wraps his garment around him,
so will he wrap Egypt around himself
and depart from there unscathed.
13There in the temple of the sun in Egypt
he will demolish the sacred pillars and
will burn down the temples of the gods
of Egypt.' "
44This word came to Jeremiah
concerning all the Jews living in Lower
Egypt-in Migdol, Tahpanhes and
Memphis -and in Upper Egypt :
2"This is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: You saw the great
disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on
all the towns of Judah. Today they lie
deserted and in ruins
3because of the evil they have done.
They provoked me to anger by burning
incense and by worshiping other gods
that neither they nor you nor your
fathers ever knew.
4Again and again I sent my servants the
prophets, who said, 'Do not do this
detestable thing that I hate!'
5But they did not listen or pay attention;
they did not turn from their wickedness
or stop burning incense to other gods.
6Therefore, my fierce anger was poured
out; it raged against the towns of Judah
and the streets of Jerusalem and made
them the desolate ruins they are today.
7"Now this is what the Lord God
Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Why
bring such great disaster on yourselves
by cutting off from Judah the men and
women, the children and infants, and so
leave yourselves without a remnant?
8Why provoke me to anger with what
your hands have made, burning incense
to other gods in Egypt, where you have
come to live? You will destroy
yourselves and make yourselves an
object of cursing and reproach among
all the nations on earth.
9Have you forgotten the wickedness
committed by your fathers and by the
kings and queens of Judah and the
wickedness committed by you and your
wives in the land of Judah and the
streets of Jerusalem?
10To this day they have not humbled
themselves or shown reverence, nor
have they followed my law and the
decrees I set before you and your
fathers.
11"Therefore, this is what the Lord
Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am
determined to bring disaster on you and
to destroy all Judah.
12I will take away the remnant of Judah
who were determined to go to Egypt to
settle there. They will all perish in Egypt;
they will fall by the sword or die from
famine. From the least to the greatest,
they will die by sword or famine. They
will become an object of cursing and
horror, of condemnation and reproach.
13I will punish those who live in Egypt
with the sword, famine and plague, as I
punished Jerusalem.
14None of the remnant of Judah who
have gone to live in Egypt will escape or
survive to return to the land of Judah, to
which they long to return and live; none
will return except a few fugitives."
15Then all the men who knew that their
wives were burning incense to other
gods, along with all the women who
were present-a large assembly-and all
the people living in Lower and Upper
Egypt, said to Jeremiah,
16"We will not listen to the message you
have spoken to us in the name of the
Lord !
17We will certainly do everything we said
we would: We will burn incense to the
Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink
offerings to her just as we and our
fathers, our kings and our officials did in
the towns of Judah and in the streets of
Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of
food and were well off and suffered no
harm.
18But ever since we stopped burning
incense to the Queen of Heaven and
pouring out drink offerings to her, we
have had nothing and have been
perishing by sword and famine."
19The women added, "When we burned
incense to the Queen of Heaven and
poured out drink offerings to her, did not
our husbands know that we were
making cakes like her image and
pouring out drink offerings to her?"
20Then Jeremiah said to all the people,
both men and women, who were
answering him,
21"Did not the Lord remember and think
about the incense burned in the towns
of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem
by you and your fathers, your kings and
your officials and the people of the land?
22When the Lord could no longer endure
your wicked actions and the detestable
things you did, your land became an
object of cursing and a desolate waste
without inhabitants, as it is today.
23Because you have burned incense
and have sinned against the Lord and
have not obeyed him or followed his law
or his decrees or his stipulations, this
disaster has come upon you, as you
now see."
24Then Jeremiah said to all the people,
including the women, "Hear the word of
the Lord , all you people of Judah in
Egypt.
25This is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: You and your wives
have shown by your actions what you
promised when you said, 'We will
certainly carry out the vows we made to
burn incense and pour out drink
offerings to the Queen of Heaven.' "Go
ahead then, do what you promised!
Keep your vows!
26But hear the word of the Lord , all
Jews living in Egypt: 'I swear by my
great name,' says the Lord , 'that no one
from Judah living anywhere in Egypt will
ever again invoke my name or swear,
"As surely as the Sovereign Lord lives."
27For I am watching over them for harm,
not for good; the Jews in Egypt will
perish by sword and famine until they
are all destroyed.
28Those who escape the sword and
return to the land of Judah from Egypt
will be very few. Then the whole
remnant of Judah who came to live in
Egypt will know whose word will standmine
or theirs.
29" 'This will be the sign to you that I will
punish you in this place,' declares the
Lord , 'so that you will know that my
threats of harm against you will surely
stand.'
30This is what the Lord says: 'I am going
to hand Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt
over to his enemies who seek his life,
just as I handed Zedekiah king of Judah
over to Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon, the enemy who was seeking
his life.' "
45This is what Jeremiah the prophet
told Baruch son of Neriah in the fourth
year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of
Judah, after Baruch had written on a
scroll the words Jeremiah was then
dictating:
2"This is what the Lord , the God of
Israel, says to you, Baruch:
3You said, 'Woe to me! The Lord has
added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out
with groaning and find no rest.' "
4The Lord said, "Say this to him: 'This is
what the Lord says: I will overthrow what
I have built and uproot what I have
planted, throughout the land.
5Should you then seek great things for
yourself? Seek them not. For I will bring
disaster on all people, declares the
Lord , but wherever you go I will let you
escape with your life.' "
46This is the word of the Lord that
came to Jeremiah the prophet
concerning the nations:
2Concerning Egypt: This is the message
against the army of Pharaoh Neco king
of Egypt, which was defeated at
Carchemish on the Euphrates River by
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the
fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah
king of Judah:
3"Prepare your shields, both large and
small, and march out for battle!
4Harness the horses, mount the steeds!
Take your positions with helmets on!
Polish your spears, put on your armor!
5What do I see? They are terrified, they
are retreating, their warriors are
defeated. They flee in haste without
looking back, and there is terror on
every side," declares the Lord .
6"The swift cannot flee nor the strong
escape. In the north by the River
Euphrates they stumble and fall.
7"Who is this that rises like the Nile, like
rivers of surging waters?
8Egypt rises like the Nile, like rivers of
surging waters. She says, 'I will rise and
cover the earth; I will destroy cities and
their people.'
9Charge, O horses! Drive furiously, O
charioteers! March on, O warriors- men
of Cush and Put who carry shields, men
of Lydia who draw the bow.
10But that day belongs to the Lord, the
Lord Almighty- a day of vengeance, for
vengeance on his foes. The sword will
devour till it is satisfied, till it has
quenched its thirst with blood. For the
Lord, the Lord Almighty, will offer
sacrifice in the land of the north by the
River Euphrates.
11"Go up to Gilead and get balm, O
Virgin Daughter of Egypt. But you
multiply remedies in vain; there is no
healing for you.
12The nations will hear of your shame;
your cries will fill the earth. One warrior
will stumble over another; both will fall
down together."
13This is the message the Lord spoke to
Jeremiah the prophet about the coming
of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to
attack Egypt:
14"Announce this in Egypt, and proclaim
it in Migdol; proclaim it also in Memphis
and Tahpanhes: 'Take your positions
and get ready, for the sword devours
those around you.'
15Why will your warriors be laid low?
They cannot stand, for the Lord will
push them down.
16They will stumble repeatedly; they will
fall over each other. They will say, 'Get
up, let us go back to our own people
and our native lands, away from the
sword of the oppressor.'
17There they will exclaim, 'Pharaoh king
of Egypt is only a loud noise; he has
missed his opportunity.'
18"As surely as I live," declares the King,
whose name is the Lord Almighty, "one
will come who is like Tabor among the
mountains, like Carmel by the sea.
19Pack your belongings for exile, you
who live in Egypt, for Memphis will be
laid waste and lie in ruins without
inhabitant.
20"Egypt is a beautiful heifer, but a
gadfly is coming against her from the
north.
21The mercenaries in her ranks are like
fattened calves. They too will turn and
flee together, they will not stand their
ground, for the day of disaster is coming
upon them, the time for them to be
punished.
22Egypt will hiss like a fleeing serpent as
the enemy advances in force; they will
come against her with axes, like men
who cut down trees.
23They will chop down her forest,"
declares the Lord , "dense though it be.
They are more numerous than locusts,
they cannot be counted.
24The Daughter of Egypt will be put to
shame, handed over to the people of the
north."
25The Lord Almighty, the God of Israel,
says: "I am about to bring punishment
on Amon god of Thebes, on Pharaoh,
on Egypt and her gods and her kings,
and on those who rely on Pharaoh.
26I will hand them over to those who
seek their lives, to Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon and his officers. Later,
however, Egypt will be inhabited as in
times past," declares the Lord .
27"Do not fear, O Jacob my servant; do
not be dismayed, O Israel. I will surely
save you out of a distant place, your
descendants from the land of their exile.
Jacob will again have peace and
security, and no one will make him
afraid.
28Do not fear, O Jacob my servant, for I
am with you," declares the Lord .
"Though I completely destroy all the
nations among which I scatter you, I will
not completely destroy you. I will
discipline you but only with justice; I will
not let you go entirely unpunished."
47This is the word of the Lord that
came to Jeremiah the prophet
concerning the Philistines before
Pharaoh attacked Gaza:
2This is what the Lord says: "See how
the waters are rising in the north; they
will become an overflowing torrent. They
will overflow the land and everything in it,
the towns and those who live in them.
The people will cry out; all who dwell in
the land will wail
3at the sound of the hoofs of galloping
steeds, at the noise of enemy chariots
and the rumble of their wheels. Fathers
will not turn to help their children; their
hands will hang limp.
4For the day has come to destroy all the
Philistines and to cut off all survivors
who could help Tyre and Sidon. The
Lord is about to destroy the Philistines,
the remnant from the coasts of Caphtor.
5Gaza will shave her head in mourning;
Ashkelon will be silenced. O remnant on
the plain, how long will you cut
yourselves?
6" 'Ah, sword of the Lord ,' you cry, 'how
long till you rest? Return to your
scabbard; cease and be still.'
7But how can it rest when the Lord has
commanded it, when he has ordered it
to attack Ashkelon and the coast?"
48Concerning Moab: This is what
the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel,
says: "Woe to Nebo, for it will be ruined.
Kiriathaim will be disgraced and
captured; the stronghold will be
disgraced and shattered.
2Moab will be praised no more; in
Heshbon men will plot her downfall:
'Come, let us put an end to that nation.'
You too, O Madmen, will be silenced;
the sword will pursue you.
3Listen to the cries from Horonaim, cries
of great havoc and destruction.
4Moab will be broken; her little ones will
cry out.
5They go up the way to Luhith, weeping
bitterly as they go; on the road down to
Horonaim anguished cries over the
destruction are heard.
6Flee! Run for your lives; become like a
bush in the desert.
7Since you trust in your deeds and
riches, you too will be taken captive, and
Chemosh will go into exile, together with
his priests and officials.
8The destroyer will come against every
town, and not a town will escape. The
valley will be ruined and the plateau
destroyed, because the Lord has
spoken.
9Put salt on Moab, for she will be laid
waste ; her towns will become desolate,
with no one to live in them.
10"A curse on him who is lax in doing the
Lord 's work! A curse on him who keeps
his sword from bloodshed!
11"Moab has been at rest from youth,
like wine left on its dregs, not poured
from one jar to another- she has not
gone into exile. So she tastes as she did,
and her aroma is unchanged.
12But days are coming," declares the
Lord , "when I will send men who pour
from jars, and they will pour her out;
they will empty her jars and smash her
jugs.
13Then Moab will be ashamed of
Chemosh, as the house of Israel was
ashamed when they trusted in Bethel.
14"How can you say, 'We are warriors,
men valiant in battle'?
15Moab will be destroyed and her towns
invaded; her finest young men will go
down in the slaughter," declares the
King, whose name is the Lord Almighty.
16"The fall of Moab is at hand; her
calamity will come quickly.
17Mourn for her, all who live around her,
all who know her fame; say, 'How
broken is the mighty scepter, how
broken the glorious staff!'
18"Come down from your glory and sit on
the parched ground, O inhabitants of the
Daughter of Dibon, for he who destroys
Moab will come up against you and ruin
your fortified cities.
19Stand by the road and watch, you who
live in Aroer. Ask the man fleeing and
the woman escaping, ask them, 'What
has happened?'
20Moab is disgraced, for she is shattered.
Wail and cry out! Announce by the
Arnon that Moab is destroyed.
21Judgment has come to the plateau- to
Holon, Jahzah and Mephaath,
22to Dibon, Nebo and Beth Diblathaim,
23to Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul and Beth
Meon,
24to Kerioth and Bozrah- to all the towns
of Moab, far and near.
25Moab's horn is cut off; her arm is
broken," declares the Lord .
26"Make her drunk, for she has defied
the Lord . Let Moab wallow in her vomit;
let her be an object of ridicule.
27Was not Israel the object of your
ridicule? Was she caught among thieves,
that you shake your head in scorn
whenever you speak of her?
28Abandon your towns and dwell among
the rocks, you who live in Moab. Be like
a dove that makes its nest at the mouth
of a cave.
29"We have heard of Moab's pride- her
overweening pride and conceit, her
pride and arrogance and the
haughtiness of her heart.
30I know her insolence but it is futile,"
declares the Lord , "and her boasts
accomplish nothing.
31Therefore I wail over Moab, for all
Moab I cry out, I moan for the men of Kir
Hareseth.
32I weep for you, as Jazer weeps, O
vines of Sibmah. Your branches spread
as far as the sea; they reached as far as
the sea of Jazer. The destroyer has
fallen on your ripened fruit and grapes.
33Joy and gladness are gone from the
orchards and fields of Moab. I have
stopped the flow of wine from the
presses; no one treads them with shouts
of joy. Although there are shouts, they
are not shouts of joy.
34"The sound of their cry rises from
Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz, from
Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath
Shelishiyah, for even the waters of
Nimrim are dried up.
35In Moab I will put an end to those who
make offerings on the high places and
burn incense to their gods," declares the
Lord .
36"So my heart laments for Moab like a
flute; it laments like a flute for the men of
Kir Hareseth. The wealth they acquired
is gone.
37Every head is shaved and every beard
cut off; every hand is slashed and every
waist is covered with sackcloth.
38On all the roofs in Moab and in the
public squares there is nothing but
mourning, for I have broken Moab like a
jar that no one wants," declares the
Lord .
39"How shattered she is! How they wail!
How Moab turns her back in shame!
Moab has become an object of ridicule,
an object of horror to all those around
her."
40This is what the Lord says: "Look! An
eagle is swooping down, spreading its
wings over Moab.
41Kerioth will be captured and the
strongholds taken. In that day the hearts
of Moab's warriors will be like the heart
of a woman in labor.
42Moab will be destroyed as a nation
because she defied the Lord .
43Terror and pit and snare await you, O
people of Moab," declares the Lord .
44"Whoever flees from the terror will fall
into a pit, whoever climbs out of the pit
will be caught in a snare; for I will bring
upon Moab the year of her punishment,"
declares the Lord .
45"In the shadow of Heshbon the
fugitives stand helpless, for a fire has
gone out from Heshbon, a blaze from
the midst of Sihon; it burns the
foreheads of Moab, the skulls of the
noisy boasters.
46Woe to you, O Moab! The people of
Chemosh are destroyed; your sons are
taken into exile and your daughters into
captivity.
47"Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab
in days to come," declares the Lord .
Here ends the judgment on Moab.
49Concerning the Ammonites: This
is what the Lord says: "Has Israel no
sons? Has she no heirs? Why then has
Molech taken possession of Gad? Why
do his people live in its towns?
2But the days are coming," declares the
Lord , "when I will sound the battle cry
against Rabbah of the Ammonites; it will
become a mound of ruins, and its
surrounding villages will be set on fire.
Then Israel will drive out those who
drove her out," says the Lord .
3"Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is destroyed!
Cry out, O inhabitants of Rabbah! Put
on sackcloth and mourn; rush here and
there inside the walls, for Molech will go
into exile, together with his priests and
officials.
4Why do you boast of your valleys,
boast of your valleys so fruitful? O
unfaithful daughter, you trust in your
riches and say, 'Who will attack me?'
5I will bring terror on you from all those
around you," declares the Lord, the Lord
Almighty. "Every one of you will be
driven away, and no one will gather the
fugitives.
6"Yet afterward, I will restore the
fortunes of the Ammonites," declares
the Lord .
7Concerning Edom: This is what the
Lord Almighty says: "Is there no longer
wisdom in Teman? Has counsel
perished from the prudent? Has their
wisdom decayed?
8Turn and flee, hide in deep caves, you
who live in Dedan, for I will bring
disaster on Esau at the time I punish
him.
9If grape pickers came to you, would
they not leave a few grapes? If thieves
came during the night, would they not
steal only as much as they wanted?
10But I will strip Esau bare; I will uncover
his hiding places, so that he cannot
conceal himself. His children, relatives
and neighbors will perish, and he will be
no more.
11Leave your orphans; I will protect their
lives. Your widows too can trust in me."
12This is what the Lord says: "If those
who do not deserve to drink the cup
must drink it, why should you go
unpunished? You will not go unpunished,
but must drink it.
13I swear by myself," declares the Lord ,
"that Bozrah will become a ruin and an
object of horror, of reproach and of
cursing; and all its towns will be in ruins
forever."
14I have heard a message from the
Lord : An envoy was sent to the nations
to say, "Assemble yourselves to attack
it! Rise up for battle!"
15"Now I will make you small among the
nations, despised among men.
16The terror you inspire and the pride of
your heart have deceived you, you who
live in the clefts of the rocks, who
occupy the heights of the hill. Though
you build your nest as high as the
eagle's, from there I will bring you
down," declares the Lord .
17"Edom will become an object of horror;
all who pass by will be appalled and will
scoff because of all its wounds.
18As Sodom and Gomorrah were
overthrown, along with their neighboring
towns," says the Lord , "so no one will
live there; no man will dwell in it.
19"Like a lion coming up from Jordan's
thickets to a rich pastureland, I will
chase Edom from its land in an instant.
Who is the chosen one I will appoint for
this? Who is like me and who can
challenge me? And what shepherd can
stand against me?"
20Therefore, hear what the Lord has
planned against Edom, what he has
purposed against those who live in
Teman: The young of the flock will be
dragged away; he will completely
destroy their pasture because of them.
21At the sound of their fall the earth will
tremble; their cry will resound to the Red
Sea.
22Look! An eagle will soar and swoop
down, spreading its wings over Bozrah.
In that day the hearts of Edom's warriors
will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
23Concerning Damascus: "Hamath and
Arpad are dismayed, for they have
heard bad news. They are disheartened,
troubled like the restless sea.
24Damascus has become feeble, she
has turned to flee and panic has gripped
her; anguish and pain have seized her,
pain like that of a woman in labor.
25Why has the city of renown not been
abandoned, the town in which I delight?
26Surely, her young men will fall in the
streets; all her soldiers will be silenced
in that day," declares the Lord Almighty.
27"I will set fire to the walls of Damascus;
it will consume the fortresses of Ben-
Hadad."
28Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms
of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon attacked: This is what the Lord
says: "Arise, and attack Kedar and
destroy the people of the East.
29Their tents and their flocks will be
taken; their shelters will be carried off
with all their goods and camels. Men will
shout to them, 'Terror on every side!'
30"Flee quickly away! Stay in deep caves,
you who live in Hazor," declares the
Lord . "Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
has plotted against you; he has devised
a plan against you.
31"Arise and attack a nation at ease,
which lives in confidence," declares the
Lord , "a nation that has neither gates
nor bars; its people live alone.
32Their camels will become plunder, and
their large herds will be booty. I will
scatter to the winds those who are in
distant places and will bring disaster on
them from every side," declares the
Lord .
33"Hazor will become a haunt of jackals,
a desolate place forever. No one will live
there; no man will dwell in it."
34This is the word of the Lord that came
to Jeremiah the prophet concerning
Elam, early in the reign of Zedekiah king
of Judah:
35This is what the Lord Almighty says:
"See, I will break the bow of Elam, the
mainstay of their might.
36I will bring against Elam the four winds
from the four quarters of the heavens; I
will scatter them to the four winds, and
there will not be a nation where Elam's
exiles do not go.
37I will shatter Elam before their foes,
before those who seek their lives; I will
bring disaster upon them, even my
fierce anger," declares the Lord . "I will
pursue them with the sword until I have
made an end of them.
38I will set my throne in Elam and
destroy her king and officials," declares
the Lord .
39"Yet I will restore the fortunes of Elam
in days to come," declares the Lord .
50This is the word the Lord spoke
through Jeremiah the prophet
concerning Babylon and the land of the
Babylonians :
2"Announce and proclaim among the
nations, lift up a banner and proclaim it;
keep nothing back, but say, 'Babylon will
be captured; Bel will be put to shame,
Marduk filled with terror. Her images will
be put to shame and her idols filled with
terror.'
3A nation from the north will attack her
and lay waste her land. No one will live
in it; both men and animals will flee
away.
4"In those days, at that time," declares
the Lord , "the people of Israel and the
people of Judah together will go in tears
to seek the Lord their God.
5They will ask the way to Zion and turn
their faces toward it. They will come and
bind themselves to the Lord in an
everlasting covenant that will not be
forgotten.
6"My people have been lost sheep; their
shepherds have led them astray and
caused them to roam on the mountains.
They wandered over mountain and hill
and forgot their own resting place.
7Whoever found them devoured them;
their enemies said, 'We are not guilty,
for they sinned against the Lord , their
true pasture, the Lord , the hope of their
fathers.'
8"Flee out of Babylon; leave the land of
the Babylonians, and be like the goats
that lead the flock.
9For I will stir up and bring against
Babylon an alliance of great nations
from the land of the north. They will take
up their positions against her, and from
the north she will be captured. Their
arrows will be like skilled warriors who
do not return empty-handed.
10So Babylonia will be plundered; all
who plunder her will have their fill,"
declares the Lord .
11"Because you rejoice and are glad,
you who pillage my inheritance,
because you frolic like a heifer threshing
grain and neigh like stallions,
12your mother will be greatly ashamed;
she who gave you birth will be disgraced.
She will be the least of the nations- a
wilderness, a dry land, a desert.
13Because of the Lord 's anger she will
not be inhabited but will be completely
desolate. All who pass Babylon will be
horrified and scoff because of all her
wounds.
14"Take up your positions around
Babylon, all you who draw the bow.
Shoot at her! Spare no arrows, for she
has sinned against the Lord .
15Shout against her on every side! She
surrenders, her towers fall, her walls are
torn down. Since this is the vengeance
of the Lord , take vengeance on her; do
to her as she has done to others.
16Cut off from Babylon the sower, and
the reaper with his sickle at harvest.
Because of the sword of the oppressor
let everyone return to his own people,
let everyone flee to his own land.
17"Israel is a scattered flock that lions
have chased away. The first to devour
him was the king of Assyria; the last to
crush his bones was Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon."
18Therefore this is what the Lord
Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "I will
punish the king of Babylon and his land
as I punished the king of Assyria.
19But I will bring Israel back to his own
pasture and he will graze on Carmel and
Bashan; his appetite will be satisfied on
the hills of Ephraim and Gilead.
20In those days, at that time," declares
the Lord , "search will be made for
Israel's guilt, but there will be none, and
for the sins of Judah, but none will be
found, for I will forgive the remnant I
spare.
21"Attack the land of Merathaim and
those who live in Pekod. Pursue, kill and
completely destroy them," declares the
Lord . "Do everything I have
commanded you.
22The noise of battle is in the land, the
noise of great destruction!
23How broken and shattered is the
hammer of the whole earth! How
desolate is Babylon among the nations!
24I set a trap for you, O Babylon, and
you were caught before you knew it; you
were found and captured because you
opposed the Lord .
25The Lord has opened his arsenal and
brought out the weapons of his wrath,
for the Sovereign Lord Almighty has
work to do in the land of the
Babylonians.
26Come against her from afar. Break
open her granaries; pile her up like
heaps of grain. Completely destroy her
and leave her no remnant.
27Kill all her young bulls; let them go
down to the slaughter! Woe to them! For
their day has come, the time for them to
be punished.
28Listen to the fugitives and refugees
from Babylon declaring in Zion how the
Lord our God has taken vengeance,
vengeance for his temple.
29"Summon archers against Babylon, all
those who draw the bow. Encamp all
around her; let no one escape. Repay
her for her deeds; do to her as she has
done. For she has defied the Lord , the
Holy One of Israel.
30Therefore, her young men will fall in
the streets; all her soldiers will be
silenced in that day," declares the Lord .
31"See, I am against you, O arrogant
one," declares the Lord, the Lord
Almighty, "for your day has come, the
time for you to be punished.
32The arrogant one will stumble and fall
and no one will help her up; I will kindle
a fire in her towns that will consume all
who are around her."
33This is what the Lord Almighty says:
"The people of Israel are oppressed,
and the people of Judah as well. All their
captors hold them fast, refusing to let
them go.
34Yet their Redeemer is strong; the Lord
Almighty is his name. He will vigorously
defend their cause so that he may bring
rest to their land, but unrest to those
who live in Babylon.
35"A sword against the Babylonians!"
declares the Lord - "against those who
live in Babylon and against her officials
and wise men!
36A sword against her false prophets!
They will become fools. A sword against
her warriors! They will be filled with
terror.
37A sword against her horses and
chariots and all the foreigners in her
ranks! They will become women. A
sword against her treasures! They will
be plundered.
38A drought on her waters! They will dry
up. For it is a land of idols, idols that will
go mad with terror.
39"So desert creatures and hyenas will
live there, and there the owl will dwell. It
will never again be inhabited or lived in
from generation to generation.
40As God overthrew Sodom and
Gomorrah along with their neighboring
towns," declares the Lord , "so no one
will live there; no man will dwell in it.
41"Look! An army is coming from the
north; a great nation and many kings are
being stirred up from the ends of the
earth.
42They are armed with bows and spears;
they are cruel and without mercy. They
sound like the roaring sea as they ride
on their horses; they come like men in
battle formation to attack you, O
Daughter of Babylon.
43The king of Babylon has heard reports
about them, and his hands hang limp.
Anguish has gripped him, pain like that
of a woman in labor.
44Like a lion coming up from Jordan's
thickets to a rich pastureland, I will
chase Babylon from its land in an instant.
Who is the chosen one I will appoint for
this? Who is like me and who can
challenge me? And what shepherd can
stand against me?"
45Therefore, hear what the Lord has
planned against Babylon, what he has
purposed against the land of the
Babylonians: The young of the flock will
be dragged away; he will completely
destroy their pasture because of them.
46At the sound of Babylon's capture the
earth will tremble; its cry will resound
among the nations.
51This is what the Lord says: "See, I
will stir up the spirit of a destroyer
against Babylon and the people of Leb
Kamai.
2I will send foreigners to Babylon to
winnow her and to devastate her land;
they will oppose her on every side in the
day of her disaster.
3Let not the archer string his bow, nor let
him put on his armor. Do not spare her
young men; completely destroy her
army.
4They will fall down slain in Babylon,
fatally wounded in her streets.
5For Israel and Judah have not been
forsaken by their God, the Lord Almighty,
though their land is full of guilt before
the Holy One of Israel.
6"Flee from Babylon! Run for your lives!
Do not be destroyed because of her sins.
It is time for the Lord 's vengeance; he
will pay her what she deserves.
7Babylon was a gold cup in the Lord 's
hand; she made the whole earth drunk.
The nations drank her wine; therefore
they have now gone mad.
8Babylon will suddenly fall and be
broken. Wail over her! Get balm for her
pain; perhaps she can be healed.
9" 'We would have healed Babylon, but
she cannot be healed; let us leave her
and each go to his own land, for her
judgment reaches to the skies, it rises
as high as the clouds.'
10" 'The Lord has vindicated us; come,
let us tell in Zion what the Lord our God
has done.'
11"Sharpen the arrows, take up the
shields! The Lord has stirred up the
kings of the Medes, because his
purpose is to destroy Babylon. The Lord
will take vengeance, vengeance for his
temple.
12Lift up a banner against the walls of
Babylon! Reinforce the guard, station
the watchmen, prepare an ambush! The
Lord will carry out his purpose, his
decree against the people of Babylon.
13You who live by many waters and are
rich in treasures, your end has come,
the time for you to be cut off.
14The Lord Almighty has sworn by
himself: I will surely fill you with men, as
with a swarm of locusts, and they will
shout in triumph over you.
15"He made the earth by his power; he
founded the world by his wisdom and
stretched out the heavens by his
understanding.
16When he thunders, the waters in the
heavens roar; he makes clouds rise
from the ends of the earth. He sends
lightning with the rain and brings out the
wind from his storehouses.
17"Every man is senseless and without
knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed
by his idols. His images are a fraud;
they have no breath in them.
18They are worthless, the objects of
mockery; when their judgment comes,
they will perish.
19He who is the Portion of Jacob is not
like these, for he is the Maker of all
things, including the tribe of his
inheritance- the Lord Almighty is his
name.
20"You are my war club, my weapon for
battle- with you I shatter nations, with
you I destroy kingdoms,
21with you I shatter horse and rider, with
you I shatter chariot and driver,
22with you I shatter man and woman,
with you I shatter old man and youth,
with you I shatter young man and
maiden,
23with you I shatter shepherd and flock,
with you I shatter farmer and oxen, with
you I shatter governors and officials.
24"Before your eyes I will repay Babylon
and all who live in Babylonia for all the
wrong they have done in Zion," declares
the Lord .
25"I am against you, O destroying
mountain, you who destroy the whole
earth," declares the Lord . "I will stretch
out my hand against you, roll you off the
cliffs, and make you a burned-out
mountain.
26No rock will be taken from you for a
cornerstone, nor any stone for a
foundation, for you will be desolate
forever," declares the Lord .
27"Lift up a banner in the land! Blow the
trumpet among the nations! Prepare the
nations for battle against her; summon
against her these kingdoms: Ararat,
Minni and Ashkenaz. Appoint a
commander against her; send up horses
like a swarm of locusts.
28Prepare the nations for battle against
her- the kings of the Medes, their
governors and all their officials, and all
the countries they rule.
29The land trembles and writhes, for the
Lord 's purposes against Babylon standto
lay waste the land of Babylon so that
no one will live there.
30Babylon's warriors have stopped
fighting; they remain in their strongholds.
Their strength is exhausted; they have
become like women. Her dwellings are
set on fire; the bars of her gates are
broken.
31One courier follows another and
messenger follows messenger to
announce to the king of Babylon that his
entire city is captured,
32the river crossings seized, the
marshes set on fire, and the soldiers
terrified."
33This is what the Lord Almighty, the
God of Israel, says: "The Daughter of
Babylon is like a threshing floor at the
time it is trampled; the time to harvest
her will soon come."
34"Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has
devoured us, he has thrown us into
confusion, he has made us an empty jar.
Like a serpent he has swallowed us and
filled his stomach with our delicacies,
and then has spewed us out.
35May the violence done to our flesh be
upon Babylon," say the inhabitants of
Zion. "May our blood be on those who
live in Babylonia," says Jerusalem.
36Therefore, this is what the Lord says:
"See, I will defend your cause and
avenge you; I will dry up her sea and
make her springs dry.
37Babylon will be a heap of ruins, a
haunt of jackals, an object of horror and
scorn, a place where no one lives.
38Her people all roar like young lions,
they growl like lion cubs.
39But while they are aroused, I will set
out a feast for them and make them
drunk, so that they shout with laughterthen
sleep forever and not awake,"
declares the Lord .
40"I will bring them down like lambs to
the slaughter, like rams and goats.
41"How Sheshach will be captured, the
boast of the whole earth seized! What a
horror Babylon will be among the
nations!
42The sea will rise over Babylon; its
roaring waves will cover her.
43Her towns will be desolate, a dry and
desert land, a land where no one lives,
through which no man travels.
44I will punish Bel in Babylon and make
him spew out what he has swallowed.
The nations will no longer stream to him.
And the wall of Babylon will fall.
45"Come out of her, my people! Run for
your lives! Run from the fierce anger of
the Lord .
46Do not lose heart or be afraid when
rumors are heard in the land; one rumor
comes this year, another the next,
rumors of violence in the land and of
ruler against ruler.
47For the time will surely come when I
will punish the idols of Babylon; her
whole land will be disgraced and her
slain will all lie fallen within her.
48Then heaven and earth and all that is
in them will shout for joy over Babylon,
for out of the north destroyers will attack
her," declares the Lord .
49"Babylon must fall because of Israel's
slain, just as the slain in all the earth
have fallen because of Babylon.
50You who have escaped the sword,
leave and do not linger! Remember the
Lord in a distant land, and think on
Jerusalem."
51"We are disgraced, for we have been
insulted and shame covers our faces,
because foreigners have entered the
holy places of the Lord 's house."
52"But days are coming," declares the
Lord , "when I will punish her idols, and
throughout her land the wounded will
groan.
53Even if Babylon reaches the sky and
fortifies her lofty stronghold, I will send
destroyers against her," declares the
Lord .
54"The sound of a cry comes from
Babylon, the sound of great destruction
from the land of the Babylonians.
55The Lord will destroy Babylon; he will
silence her noisy din. Waves of enemies
will rage like great waters; the roar of
their voices will resound.
56A destroyer will come against Babylon;
her warriors will be captured, and their
bows will be broken. For the Lord is a
God of retribution; he will repay in full.
57I will make her officials and wise men
drunk, her governors, officers and
warriors as well; they will sleep forever
and not awake," declares the King,
whose name is the Lord Almighty.
58This is what the Lord Almighty says:
"Babylon's thick wall will be leveled and
her high gates set on fire; the peoples
exhaust themselves for nothing, the
nations' labor is only fuel for the flames."
59This is the message Jeremiah gave to
the staff officer Seraiah son of Neriah,
the son of Mahseiah, when he went to
Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in
the fourth year of his reign.
60Jeremiah had written on a scroll about
all the disasters that would come upon
Babylon-all that had been recorded
concerning Babylon.
61He said to Seraiah, "When you get to
Babylon, see that you read all these
words aloud.
62Then say, 'O Lord , you have said you
will destroy this place, so that neither
man nor animal will live in it; it will be
desolate forever.'
63When you finish reading this scroll, tie
a stone to it and throw it into the
Euphrates.
64Then say, 'So will Babylon sink to rise
no more because of the disaster I will
bring upon her. And her people will fall.'
" The words of Jeremiah end here.
52Zedekiah was twenty-one years
old when he became king, and he
reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His
mother's name was Hamutal daughter of
Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
2He did evil in the eyes of the Lord , just
as Jehoiakim had done.
3It was because of the Lord 's anger that
all this happened to Jerusalem and
Judah, and in the end he thrust them
from his presence. Now Zedekiah
rebelled against the king of Babylon.
4So in the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign,
on the tenth day of the tenth month,
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
marched against Jerusalem with his
whole army. They camped outside the
city and built siege works all around it.
5The city was kept under siege until the
eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
6By the ninth day of the fourth month the
famine in the city had become so severe
that there was no food for the people to
eat.
7Then the city wall was broken through,
and the whole army fled. They left the
city at night through the gate between
the two walls near the king's garden,
though the Babylonians were
surrounding the city. They fled toward
the Arabah,
8but the Babylonian army pursued King
Zedekiah and overtook him in the plains
of Jericho. All his soldiers were
separated from him and scattered,
9and he was captured. He was taken to
the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land
of Hamath, where he pronounced
sentence on him.
10There at Riblah the king of Babylon
slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before
his eyes; he also killed all the officials of
Judah.
11Then he put out Zedekiah's eyes,
bound him with bronze shackles and
took him to Babylon, where he put him
in prison till the day of his death.
12On the tenth day of the fifth month, in
the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan
commander of the imperial guard, who
served the king of Babylon, came to
Jerusalem.
13He set fire to the temple of the Lord ,
the royal palace and all the houses of
Jerusalem. Every important building he
burned down.
14The whole Babylonian army under the
commander of the imperial guard broke
down all the walls around Jerusalem.
15Nebuzaradan the commander of the
guard carried into exile some of the
poorest people and those who remained
in the city, along with the rest of the
craftsmen and those who had gone over
to the king of Babylon.
16But Nebuzaradan left behind the rest
of the poorest people of the land to work
the vineyards and fields.
17The Babylonians broke up the bronze
pillars, the movable stands and the
bronze Sea that were at the temple of
the Lord and they carried all the bronze
to Babylon.
18They also took away the pots, shovels,
wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes
and all the bronze articles used in the
temple service.
19The commander of the imperial guard
took away the basins, censers,
sprinkling bowls, pots, lampstands,
dishes and bowls used for drink
offerings-all that were made of pure gold
or silver.
20The bronze from the two pillars, the
Sea and the twelve bronze bulls under it,
and the movable stands, which King
Solomon had made for the temple of the
Lord , was more than could be weighed.
21Each of the pillars was eighteen cubits
high and twelve cubits in
circumference ; each was four fingers
thick, and hollow.
22The bronze capital on top of the one
pillar was five cubits high and was
decorated with a network and
pomegranates of bronze all around. The
other pillar, with its pomegranates, was
similar.
23There were ninety-six pomegranates
on the sides; the total number of
pomegranates above the surrounding
network was a hundred.
24The commander of the guard took as
prisoners Seraiah the chief priest,
Zephaniah the priest next in rank and
the three doorkeepers.
25Of those still in the city, he took the
officer in charge of the fighting men, and
seven royal advisers. He also took the
secretary who was chief officer in
charge of conscripting the people of the
land and sixty of his men who were
found in the city.
26Nebuzaradan the commander took
them all and brought them to the king of
Babylon at Riblah.
27There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath,
the king had them executed. So Judah
went into captivity, away from her land.
28This is the number of the people
Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile: in
the seventh year, 3,023 Jews;
29in Nebuchadnezzar's eighteenth year,
832 people from Jerusalem;
30in his twenty-third year, 745 Jews
taken into exile by Nebuzaradan the
commander of the imperial guard. There
were 4,600 people in all.
31In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of
Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the year
Evil-Merodach became king of Babylon,
he released Jehoiachin king of Judah
and freed him from prison on the twentyfifth
day of the twelfth month.
32He spoke kindly to him and gave him a
seat of honor higher than those of the
other kings who were with him in
Babylon.
33So Jehoiachin put aside his prison
clothes and for the rest of his life ate
regularly at the king's table.
34Day by day the king of Babylon gave
Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long
as he lived, till the day of his death.
Lamentations
1How deserted lies the city, once so
full of people! How like a widow is she,
who once was great among the nations!
She who was queen among the
provinces has now become a slave.
2Bitterly she weeps at night, tears are
upon her cheeks. Among all her lovers
there is none to comfort her. All her
friends have betrayed her; they have
become her enemies.
3After affliction and harsh labor, Judah
has gone into exile. She dwells among
the nations; she finds no resting place.
All who pursue her have overtaken her
in the midst of her distress.
4The roads to Zion mourn, for no one
comes to her appointed feasts. All her
gateways are desolate, her priests
groan, her maidens grieve, and she is in
bitter anguish.
5Her foes have become her masters; her
enemies are at ease. The Lord has
brought her grief because of her many
sins. Her children have gone into exile,
captive before the foe.
6All the splendor has departed from the
Daughter of Zion. Her princes are like
deer that find no pasture; in weakness
they have fled before the pursuer.
7In the days of her affliction and
wandering Jerusalem remembers all the
treasures that were hers in days of old.
When her people fell into enemy hands,
there was no one to help her. Her
enemies looked at her and laughed at
her destruction.
8Jerusalem has sinned greatly and so
has become unclean. All who honored
her despise her, for they have seen her
nakedness; she herself groans and
turns away.
9Her filthiness clung to her skirts; she
did not consider her future. Her fall was
astounding; there was none to comfort
her. "Look, O Lord , on my affliction, for
the enemy has triumphed."
10The enemy laid hands on all her
treasures; she saw pagan nations enter
her sanctuary- those you had forbidden
to enter your assembly.
11All her people groan as they search for
bread; they barter their treasures for
food to keep themselves alive. "Look, O
Lord , and consider, for I am despised."
12"Is it nothing to you, all you who pass
by? Look around and see. Is any
suffering like my suffering that was
inflicted on me, that the Lord brought on
me in the day of his fierce anger?
13"From on high he sent fire, sent it
down into my bones. He spread a net
for my feet and turned me back. He
made me desolate, faint all the day long.
14"My sins have been bound into a
yoke ; by his hands they were woven
together. They have come upon my
neck and the Lord has sapped my
strength. He has handed me over to
those I cannot withstand.
15"The Lord has rejected all the warriors
in my midst; he has summoned an army
against me to crush my young men. In
his winepress the Lord has trampled the
Virgin Daughter of Judah.
16"This is why I weep and my eyes
overflow with tears. No one is near to
comfort me, no one to restore my spirit.
My children are destitute because the
enemy has prevailed."
17Zion stretches out her hands, but there
is no one to comfort her. The Lord has
decreed for Jacob that his neighbors
become his foes; Jerusalem has
become an unclean thing among them.
18"The Lord is righteous, yet I rebelled
against his command. Listen, all you
peoples; look upon my suffering. My
young men and maidens have gone into
exile.
19"I called to my allies but they betrayed
me. My priests and my elders perished
in the city while they searched for food
to keep themselves alive.
20"See, O Lord , how distressed I am! I
am in torment within, and in my heart I
am disturbed, for I have been most
rebellious. Outside, the sword bereaves;
inside, there is only death.
21"People have heard my groaning, but
there is no one to comfort me. All my
enemies have heard of my distress; they
rejoice at what you have done. May you
bring the day you have announced so
they may become like me.
22"Let all their wickedness come before
you; deal with them as you have dealt
with me because of all my sins. My
groans are many and my heart is faint."
2How the Lord has covered the
Daughter of Zion with the cloud of his
anger ! He has hurled down the
splendor of Israel from heaven to earth;
he has not remembered his footstool in
the day of his anger.
2Without pity the Lord has swallowed up
all the dwellings of Jacob; in his wrath
he has torn down the strongholds of the
Daughter of Judah. He has brought her
kingdom and its princes down to the
ground in dishonor.
3In fierce anger he has cut off every
horn of Israel. He has withdrawn his
right hand at the approach of the enemy.
He has burned in Jacob like a flaming
fire that consumes everything around it.
4Like an enemy he has strung his bow;
his right hand is ready. Like a foe he has
slain all who were pleasing to the eye;
he has poured out his wrath like fire on
the tent of the Daughter of Zion.
5The Lord is like an enemy; he has
swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed
up all her palaces and destroyed her
strongholds. He has multiplied mourning
and lamentation for the Daughter of
Judah.
6He has laid waste his dwelling like a
garden; he has destroyed his place of
meeting. The Lord has made Zion forget
her appointed feasts and her Sabbaths;
in his fierce anger he has spurned both
king and priest.
7The Lord has rejected his altar and
abandoned his sanctuary. He has
handed over to the enemy the walls of
her palaces; they have raised a shout in
the house of the Lord as on the day of
an appointed feast.
8The Lord determined to tear down the
wall around the Daughter of Zion. He
stretched out a measuring line and did
not withhold his hand from destroying.
He made ramparts and walls lament;
together they wasted away.
9Her gates have sunk into the ground;
their bars he has broken and destroyed.
Her king and her princes are exiled
among the nations, the law is no more,
and her prophets no longer find visions
from the Lord .
10The elders of the Daughter of Zion sit
on the ground in silence; they have
sprinkled dust on their heads and put on
sackcloth. The young women of
Jerusalem have bowed their heads to
the ground.
11My eyes fail from weeping, I am in
torment within, my heart is poured out
on the ground because my people are
destroyed, because children and infants
faint in the streets of the city.
12They say to their mothers, "Where is
bread and wine?" as they faint like
wounded men in the streets of the city,
as their lives ebb away in their mothers'
arms.
13What can I say for you? With what can
I compare you, O Daughter of
Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, that
I may comfort you, O Virgin Daughter of
Zion? Your wound is as deep as the sea.
Who can heal you?
14The visions of your prophets were
false and worthless; they did not expose
your sin to ward off your captivity. The
oracles they gave you were false and
misleading.
15All who pass your way clap their hands
at you; they scoff and shake their heads
at the Daughter of Jerusalem: "Is this
the city that was called the perfection of
beauty, the joy of the whole earth?"
16All your enemies open their mouths
wide against you; they scoff and gnash
their teeth and say, "We have swallowed
her up. This is the day we have waited
for; we have lived to see it."
17The Lord has done what he planned;
he has fulfilled his word, which he
decreed long ago. He has overthrown
you without pity, he has let the enemy
gloat over you, he has exalted the horn
of your foes.
18The hearts of the people cry out to the
Lord. O wall of the Daughter of Zion, let
your tears flow like a river day and night;
give yourself no relief, your eyes no rest.
19Arise, cry out in the night, as the
watches of the night begin; pour out
your heart like water in the presence of
the Lord. Lift up your hands to him for
the lives of your children, who faint from
hunger at the head of every street.
20"Look, O Lord , and consider: Whom
have you ever treated like this? Should
women eat their offspring, the children
they have cared for? Should priest and
prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the
Lord?
21"Young and old lie together in the dust
of the streets; my young men and
maidens have fallen by the sword. You
have slain them in the day of your
anger; you have slaughtered them
without pity.
22"As you summon to a feast day, so
you summoned against me terrors on
every side. In the day of the Lord 's
anger no one escaped or survived;
those I cared for and reared, my enemy
has destroyed."
3I am the man who has seen affliction
by the rod of his wrath.
2He has driven me away and made me
walk in darkness rather than light;
3indeed, he has turned his hand against
me again and again, all day long.
4He has made my skin and my flesh
grow old and has broken my bones.
5He has besieged me and surrounded
me with bitterness and hardship.
6He has made me dwell in darkness like
those long dead.
7He has walled me in so I cannot
escape; he has weighed me down with
chains.
8Even when I call out or cry for help, he
shuts out my prayer.
9He has barred my way with blocks of
stone; he has made my paths crooked.
10Like a bear lying in wait, like a lion in
hiding,
11he dragged me from the path and
mangled me and left me without help.
12He drew his bow and made me the
target for his arrows.
13He pierced my heart with arrows from
his quiver.
14I became the laughingstock of all my
people; they mock me in song all day
long.
15He has filled me with bitter herbs and
sated me with gall.
16He has broken my teeth with gravel;
he has trampled me in the dust.
17I have been deprived of peace; I have
forgotten what prosperity is.
18So I say, "My splendor is gone and all
that I had hoped from the Lord ."
19I remember my affliction and my
wandering, the bitterness and the gall.
20I well remember them, and my soul is
downcast within me.
21Yet this I call to mind and therefore I
have hope:
22Because of the Lord 's great love we
are not consumed, for his compassions
never fail.
23They are new every morning; great is
your faithfulness.
24I say to myself, "The Lord is my
portion; therefore I will wait for him."
25The Lord is good to those whose hope
is in him, to the one who seeks him;
26it is good to wait quietly for the
salvation of the Lord .
27It is good for a man to bear the yoke
while he is young.
28Let him sit alone in silence, for the
Lord has laid it on him.
29Let him bury his face in the dust- there
may yet be hope.
30Let him offer his cheek to one who
would strike him, and let him be filled
with disgrace.
31For men are not cast off by the Lord
forever.
32Though he brings grief, he will show
compassion, so great is his unfailing
love.
33For he does not willingly bring affliction
or grief to the children of men.
34To crush underfoot all prisoners in the
land,
35to deny a man his rights before the
Most High,
36to deprive a man of justice- would not
the Lord see such things?
37Who can speak and have it happen if
the Lord has not decreed it?
38Is it not from the mouth of the Most
High that both calamities and good
things come?
39Why should any living man complain
when punished for his sins?
40Let us examine our ways and test
them, and let us return to the Lord .
41Let us lift up our hearts and our hands
to God in heaven, and say:
42"We have sinned and rebelled and you
have not forgiven.
43"You have covered yourself with anger
and pursued us; you have slain without
pity.
44You have covered yourself with a
cloud so that no prayer can get through.
45You have made us scum and refuse
among the nations.
46"All our enemies have opened their
mouths wide against us.
47We have suffered terror and pitfalls,
ruin and destruction."
48Streams of tears flow from my eyes
because my people are destroyed.
49My eyes will flow unceasingly, without
relief,
50until the Lord looks down from heaven
and sees.
51What I see brings grief to my soul
because of all the women of my city.
52Those who were my enemies without
cause hunted me like a bird.
53They tried to end my life in a pit and
threw stones at me;
54the waters closed over my head, and I
thought I was about to be cut off.
55I called on your name, O Lord , from
the depths of the pit.
56You heard my plea: "Do not close your
ears to my cry for relief."
57You came near when I called you, and
you said, "Do not fear."
58O Lord, you took up my case; you
redeemed my life.
59You have seen, O Lord , the wrong
done to me. Uphold my cause!
60You have seen the depth of their
vengeance, all their plots against me.
61O Lord , you have heard their insults,
all their plots against me-
62what my enemies whisper and mutter
against me all day long.
63Look at them! Sitting or standing, they
mock me in their songs.
64Pay them back what they deserve, O
Lord , for what their hands have done.
65Put a veil over their hearts, and may
your curse be on them!
66Pursue them in anger and destroy
them from under the heavens of the
Lord .
4How the gold has lost its luster, the
fine gold become dull! The sacred gems
are scattered at the head of every street.
2How the precious sons of Zion, once
worth their weight in gold, are now
considered as pots of clay, the work of a
potter's hands!
3Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse
their young, but my people have
become heartless like ostriches in the
desert.
4Because of thirst the infant's tongue
sticks to the roof of its mouth; the
children beg for bread, but no one gives
it to them.
5Those who once ate delicacies are
destitute in the streets. Those nurtured
in purple now lie on ash heaps.
6The punishment of my people is greater
than that of Sodom, which was
overthrown in a moment without a hand
turned to help her.
7Their princes were brighter than snow
and whiter than milk, their bodies more
ruddy than rubies, their appearance like
sapphires.
8But now they are blacker than soot;
they are not recognized in the streets.
Their skin has shriveled on their bones;
it has become as dry as a stick.
9Those killed by the sword are better off
than those who die of famine; racked
with hunger, they waste away for lack of
food from the field.
10With their own hands compassionate
women have cooked their own children,
who became their food when my people
were destroyed.
11The Lord has given full vent to his
wrath; he has poured out his fierce
anger. He kindled a fire in Zion that
consumed her foundations.
12The kings of the earth did not believe,
nor did any of the world's people, that
enemies and foes could enter the gates
of Jerusalem.
13But it happened because of the sins of
her prophets and the iniquities of her
priests, who shed within her the blood of
the righteous.
14Now they grope through the streets
like men who are blind. They are so
defiled with blood that no one dares to
touch their garments.
15"Go away! You are unclean!" men cry
to them. "Away! Away! Don't touch us!"
When they flee and wander about,
people among the nations say, "They
can stay here no longer."
16The Lord himself has scattered them;
he no longer watches over them. The
priests are shown no honor, the elders
no favor.
17Moreover, our eyes failed, looking in
vain for help; from our towers we
watched for a nation that could not save
us.
18Men stalked us at every step, so we
could not walk in our streets. Our end
was near, our days were numbered, for
our end had come.
19Our pursuers were swifter than eagles
in the sky; they chased us over the
mountains and lay in wait for us in the
desert.
20The Lord 's anointed, our very life
breath, was caught in their traps. We
thought that under his shadow we would
live among the nations.
21Rejoice and be glad, O Daughter of
Edom, you who live in the land of Uz.
But to you also the cup will be passed;
you will be drunk and stripped naked.
22O Daughter of Zion, your punishment
will end; he will not prolong your exile.
But, O Daughter of Edom, he will punish
your sin and expose your wickedness.
5Remember, O Lord , what has
happened to us; look, and see our
disgrace.
2Our inheritance has been turned over
to aliens, our homes to foreigners.
3We have become orphans and
fatherless, our mothers like widows.
4We must buy the water we drink; our
wood can be had only at a price.
5Those who pursue us are at our heels;
we are weary and find no rest.
6We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to
get enough bread.
7Our fathers sinned and are no more,
and we bear their punishment.
8Slaves rule over us, and there is none
to free us from their hands.
9We get our bread at the risk of our lives
because of the sword in the desert.
10Our skin is hot as an oven, feverish
from hunger.
11Women have been ravished in Zion,
and virgins in the towns of Judah.
12Princes have been hung up by their
hands; elders are shown no respect.
13Young men toil at the millstones; boys
stagger under loads of wood.
14The elders are gone from the city gate;
the young men have stopped their
music.
15Joy is gone from our hearts; our
dancing has turned to mourning.
16The crown has fallen from our head.
Woe to us, for we have sinned!
17Because of this our hearts are faint,
because of these things our eyes grow
dim
18for Mount Zion, which lies desolate,
with jackals prowling over it.
19You, O Lord , reign forever; your
throne endures from generation to
generation.
20Why do you always forget us? Why do
you forsake us so long?
21Restore us to yourself, O Lord , that
we may return; renew our days as of old
22unless you have utterly rejected us
and are angry with us beyond measure.
Ezekiel
1In the thirtieth year, in the fourth
month on the fifth day, while I was
among the exiles by the Kebar River,
the heavens were opened and I saw
visions of God.
2On the fifth of the month-it was the fifth
year of the exile of King Jehoiachin-
3the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel
the priest, the son of Buzi, by the Kebar
River in the land of the Babylonians.
There the hand of the LORD was upon
him.
4I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming
out of the north-an immense cloud with
flashing lightning and surrounded by
brilliant light. The center of the fire
looked like glowing metal,
5and in the fire was what looked like four
living creatures. In appearance their
form was that of a man,
6but each of them had four faces and
four wings.
7Their legs were straight; their feet were
like those of a calf and gleamed like
burnished bronze.
8Under their wings on their four sides
they had the hands of a man. All four of
them had faces and wings,
9and their wings touched one another.
Each one went straight ahead; they did
not turn as they moved.
10Their faces looked like this: Each of
the four had the face of a man, and on
the right side each had the face of a lion,
and on the left the face of an ox; each
also had the face of an eagle.
11Such were their faces. Their wings
were spread out upward; each had two
wings, one touching the wing of another
creature on either side, and two wings
covering its body.
12Each one went straight ahead.
Wherever the spirit would go, they
would go, without turning as they went.
13The appearance of the living creatures
was like burning coals of fire or like
torches. Fire moved back and forth
among the creatures; it was bright, and
lightning flashed out of it.
14The creatures sped back and forth like
flashes of lightning.
15As I looked at the living creatures, I
saw a wheel on the ground beside each
creature with its four faces.
16This was the appearance and
structure of the wheels: They sparkled
like chrysolite, and all four looked alike.
Each appeared to be made like a wheel
intersecting a wheel.
17As they moved, they would go in any
one of the four directions the creatures
faced; the wheels did not turn about as
the creatures went.
18Their rims were high and awesome,
and all four rims were full of eyes all
around.
19When the living creatures moved, the
wheels beside them moved; and when
the living creatures rose from the ground,
the wheels also rose.
20Wherever the spirit would go, they
would go, and the wheels would rise
along with them, because the spirit of
the living creatures was in the wheels.
21When the creatures moved, they also
moved; when the creatures stood still,
they also stood still; and when the
creatures rose from the ground, the
wheels rose along with them, because
the spirit of the living creatures was in
the wheels.
22Spread out above the heads of the
living creatures was what looked like an
expanse, sparkling like ice, and
awesome.
23Under the expanse their wings were
stretched out one toward the other, and
each had two wings covering its body.
24When the creatures moved, I heard
the sound of their wings, like the roar of
rushing waters, like the voice of the
Almighty, like the tumult of an army.
When they stood still, they lowered their
wings.
25Then there came a voice from above
the expanse over their heads as they
stood with lowered wings.
26Above the expanse over their heads
was what looked like a throne of
sapphire, and high above on the throne
was a figure like that of a man.
27I saw that from what appeared to be
his waist up he looked like glowing
metal, as if full of fire, and that from
there down he looked like fire; and
brilliant light surrounded him.
28Like the appearance of a rainbow in
the clouds on a rainy day, so was the
radiance around him. This was the
appearance of the likeness of the glory
of the LORD . When I saw it, I fell
facedown, and I heard the voice of one
speaking.
2He said to me, "Son of man, stand up
on your feet and I will speak to you."
2As he spoke, the Spirit came into me
and raised me to my feet, and I heard
him speaking to me.
3He said: "Son of man, I am sending you
to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation
that has rebelled against me; they and
their fathers have been in revolt against
me to this very day.
4The people to whom I am sending you
are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them,
'This is what the Sovereign LORD says.'
5And whether they listen or fail to listenfor
they are a rebellious house-they will
know that a prophet has been among
them.
6And you, son of man, do not be afraid
of them or their words. Do not be afraid,
though briers and thorns are all around
you and you live among scorpions. Do
not be afraid of what they say or terrified
by them, though they are a rebellious
house.
7You must speak my words to them,
whether they listen or fail to listen, for
they are rebellious.
8But you, son of man, listen to what I
say to you. Do not rebel like that
rebellious house; open your mouth and
eat what I give you."
9Then I looked, and I saw a hand
stretched out to me. In it was a scroll,
10which he unrolled before me. On both
sides of it were written words of lament
and mourning and woe.
3And he said to me, "Son of man, eat
what is before you, eat this scroll; then
go and speak to the house of Israel."
2So I opened my mouth, and he gave
me the scroll to eat.
3Then he said to me, "Son of man, eat
this scroll I am giving you and fill your
stomach with it." So I ate it, and it tasted
as sweet as honey in my mouth.
4He then said to me: "Son of man, go
now to the house of Israel and speak my
words to them.
5You are not being sent to a people of
obscure speech and difficult language,
but to the house of Israel-
6not to many peoples of obscure speech
and difficult language, whose words you
cannot understand. Surely if I had sent
you to them, they would have listened to
you.
7But the house of Israel is not willing to
listen to you because they are not willing
to listen to me, for the whole house of
Israel is hardened and obstinate.
8But I will make you as unyielding and
hardened as they are.
9I will make your forehead like the
hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not
be afraid of them or terrified by them,
though they are a rebellious house."
10And he said to me, "Son of man, listen
carefully and take to heart all the words I
speak to you.
11Go now to your countrymen in exile
and speak to them. Say to them, 'This is
what the Sovereign LORD says,'
whether they listen or fail to listen."
12Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I
heard behind me a loud rumbling sound-
May the glory of the LORD be praised in
his dwelling place!-
13the sound of the wings of the living
creatures brushing against each other
and the sound of the wheels beside
them, a loud rumbling sound.
14The Spirit then lifted me up and took
me away, and I went in bitterness and in
the anger of my spirit, with the strong
hand of the LORD upon me.
15I came to the exiles who lived at Tel
Abib near the Kebar River. And there,
where they were living, I sat among
them for seven days-overwhelmed.
16At the end of seven days the word of
the LORD came to me:
17"Son of man, I have made you a
watchman for the house of Israel; so
hear the word I speak and give them
warning from me.
18When I say to a wicked man, 'You will
surely die,' and you do not warn him or
speak out to dissuade him from his evil
ways in order to save his life, that
wicked man will die for his sin, and I will
hold you accountable for his blood.
19But if you do warn the wicked man and
he does not turn from his wickedness or
from his evil ways, he will die for his sin;
but you will have saved yourself.
20"Again, when a righteous man turns
from his righteousness and does evil,
and I put a stumbling block before him,
he will die. Since you did not warn him,
he will die for his sin. The righteous
things he did will not be remembered,
and I will hold you accountable for his
blood.
21But if you do warn the righteous man
not to sin and he does not sin, he will
surely live because he took warning,
and you will have saved yourself."
22The hand of the LORD was upon me
there, and he said to me, "Get up and
go out to the plain, and there I will speak
to you."
23So I got up and went out to the plain.
And the glory of the LORD was standing
there, like the glory I had seen by the
Kebar River, and I fell facedown.
24Then the Spirit came into me and
raised me to my feet. He spoke to me
and said: "Go, shut yourself inside your
house.
25And you, son of man, they will tie with
ropes; you will be bound so that you
cannot go out among the people.
26I will make your tongue stick to the
roof of your mouth so that you will be
silent and unable to rebuke them,
though they are a rebellious house.
27But when I speak to you, I will open
your mouth and you shall say to them,
'This is what the Sovereign LORD says.'
Whoever will listen let him listen, and
whoever will refuse let him refuse; for
they are a rebellious house.
4"Now, son of man, take a clay tablet,
put it in front of you and draw the city of
Jerusalem on it.
2Then lay siege to it: Erect siege works
against it, build a ramp up to it, set up
camps against it and put battering rams
around it.
3Then take an iron pan, place it as an
iron wall between you and the city and
turn your face toward it. It will be under
siege, and you shall besiege it. This will
be a sign to the house of Israel.
4"Then lie on your left side and put the
sin of the house of Israel upon yourself.
You are to bear their sin for the number
of days you lie on your side.
5I have assigned you the same number
of days as the years of their sin. So for
390 days you will bear the sin of the
house of Israel.
6"After you have finished this, lie down
again, this time on your right side, and
bear the sin of the house of Judah. I
have assigned you 40 days, a day for
each year.
7Turn your face toward the siege of
Jerusalem and with bared arm prophesy
against her.
8I will tie you up with ropes so that you
cannot turn from one side to the other
until you have finished the days of your
siege.
9"Take wheat and barley, beans and
lentils, millet and spelt; put them in a
storage jar and use them to make bread
for yourself. You are to eat it during the
390 days you lie on your side.
10Weigh out twenty shekels of food to
eat each day and eat it at set times.
11Also measure out a sixth of a hin of
water and drink it at set times.
12Eat the food as you would a barley
cake; bake it in the sight of the people,
using human excrement for fuel."
13The LORD said, "In this way the
people of Israel will eat defiled food
among the nations where I will drive
them."
14Then I said, "Not so, Sovereign
LORD ! I have never defiled myself.
From my youth until now I have never
eaten anything found dead or torn by
wild animals. No unclean meat has ever
entered my mouth."
15"Very well," he said, "I will let you bake
your bread over cow manure instead of
human excrement."
16He then said to me: "Son of man, I will
cut off the supply of food in Jerusalem.
The people will eat rationed food in
anxiety and drink rationed water in
despair,
17for food and water will be scarce. They
will be appalled at the sight of each
other and will waste away because of
their sin.
5"Now, son of man, take a sharp
sword and use it as a barber's razor to
shave your head and your beard. Then
take a set of scales and divide up the
hair.
2When the days of your siege come to
an end, burn a third of the hair with fire
inside the city. Take a third and strike it
with the sword all around the city. And
scatter a third to the wind. For I will
pursue them with drawn sword.
3But take a few strands of hair and tuck
them away in the folds of your garment.
4Again, take a few of these and throw
them into the fire and burn them up. A
fire will spread from there to the whole
house of Israel.
5"This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: This is Jerusalem, which I have
set in the center of the nations, with
countries all around her.
6Yet in her wickedness she has rebelled
against my laws and decrees more than
the nations and countries around her.
She has rejected my laws and has not
followed my decrees.
7"Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: You have been more unruly
than the nations around you and have
not followed my decrees or kept my
laws. You have not even conformed to
the standards of the nations around you.
8"Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: I myself am against you,
Jerusalem, and I will inflict punishment
on you in the sight of the nations.
9Because of all your detestable idols, I
will do to you what I have never done
before and will never do again.
10Therefore in your midst fathers will eat
their children, and children will eat their
fathers. I will inflict punishment on you
and will scatter all your survivors to the
winds.
11Therefore as surely as I live, declares
the Sovereign LORD , because you
have defiled my sanctuary with all your
vile images and detestable practices, I
myself will withdraw my favor; I will not
look on you with pity or spare you.
12A third of your people will die of the
plague or perish by famine inside you; a
third will fall by the sword outside your
walls; and a third I will scatter to the
winds and pursue with drawn sword.
13"Then my anger will cease and my
wrath against them will subside, and I
will be avenged. And when I have spent
my wrath upon them, they will know that
I the LORD have spoken in my zeal.
14"I will make you a ruin and a reproach
among the nations around you, in the
sight of all who pass by.
15You will be a reproach and a taunt, a
warning and an object of horror to the
nations around you when I inflict
punishment on you in anger and in
wrath and with stinging rebuke. I the
LORD have spoken.
16When I shoot at you with my deadly
and destructive arrows of famine, I will
shoot to destroy you. I will bring more
and more famine upon you and cut off
your supply of food.
17I will send famine and wild beasts
against you, and they will leave you
childless. Plague and bloodshed will
sweep through you, and I will bring the
sword against you. I the LORD have
spoken."
6The word of the LORD came to me:
2"Son of man, set your face against the
mountains of Israel; prophesy against
them
3and say: 'O mountains of Israel, hear
the word of the Sovereign LORD . This
is what the Sovereign LORD says to the
mountains and hills, to the ravines and
valleys: I am about to bring a sword
against you, and I will destroy your high
places.
4Your altars will be demolished and your
incense altars will be smashed; and I
will slay your people in front of your idols.
5I will lay the dead bodies of the
Israelites in front of their idols, and I will
scatter your bones around your altars.
6Wherever you live, the towns will be
laid waste and the high places
demolished, so that your altars will be
laid waste and devastated, your idols
smashed and ruined, your incense
altars broken down, and what you have
made wiped out.
7Your people will fall slain among you,
and you will know that I am the LORD .
8" 'But I will spare some, for some of you
will escape the sword when you are
scattered among the lands and nations.
9Then in the nations where they have
been carried captive, those who escape
will remember me-how I have been
grieved by their adulterous hearts, which
have turned away from me, and by their
eyes, which have lusted after their idols.
They will loathe themselves for the evil
they have done and for all their
detestable practices.
10And they will know that I am the
LORD ; I did not threaten in vain to bring
this calamity on them.
11" 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: Strike your hands together and
stamp your feet and cry out "Alas!"
because of all the wicked and
detestable practices of the house of
Israel, for they will fall by the sword,
famine and plague.
12He that is far away will die of the
plague, and he that is near will fall by
the sword, and he that survives and is
spared will die of famine. So will I spend
my wrath upon them.
13And they will know that I am the
LORD , when their people lie slain
among their idols around their altars, on
every high hill and on all the
mountaintops, under every spreading
tree and every leafy oak-places where
they offered fragrant incense to all their
idols.
14And I will stretch out my hand against
them and make the land a desolate
waste from the desert to Diblah -
wherever they live. Then they will know
that I am the LORD .' "
7The word of the LORD came to me:
2"Son of man, this is what the Sovereign
LORD says to the land of Israel: The
end! The end has come upon the four
corners of the land.
3The end is now upon you and I will
unleash my anger against you. I will
judge you according to your conduct
and repay you for all your detestable
practices.
4I will not look on you with pity or spare
you; I will surely repay you for your
conduct and the detestable practices
among you. Then you will know that I
am the LORD .
5"This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: Disaster! An unheard-of disaster is
coming.
6The end has come! The end has come!
It has roused itself against you. It has
come!
7Doom has come upon you-you who
dwell in the land. The time has come,
the day is near; there is panic, not joy,
upon the mountains.
8I am about to pour out my wrath on you
and spend my anger against you; I will
judge you according to your conduct
and repay you for all your detestable
practices.
9I will not look on you with pity or spare
you; I will repay you in accordance with
your conduct and the detestable
practices among you. Then you will
know that it is I the LORD who strikes
the blow.
10"The day is here! It has come! Doom
has burst forth, the rod has budded,
arrogance has blossomed!
11Violence has grown into a rod to
punish wickedness; none of the people
will be left, none of that crowd-no wealth,
nothing of value.
12The time has come, the day has
arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice nor the
seller grieve, for wrath is upon the whole
crowd.
13The seller will not recover the land he
has sold as long as both of them live, for
the vision concerning the whole crowd
will not be reversed. Because of their
sins, not one of them will preserve his
life.
14Though they blow the trumpet and get
everything ready, no one will go into
battle, for my wrath is upon the whole
crowd.
15"Outside is the sword, inside are
plague and famine; those in the country
will die by the sword, and those in the
city will be devoured by famine and
plague.
16All who survive and escape will be in
the mountains, moaning like doves of
the valleys, each because of his sins.
17Every hand will go limp, and every
knee will become as weak as water.
18They will put on sackcloth and be
clothed with terror. Their faces will be
covered with shame and their heads will
be shaved.
19They will throw their silver into the
streets, and their gold will be an unclean
thing. Their silver and gold will not be
able to save them in the day of the
LORD 's wrath. They will not satisfy their
hunger or fill their stomachs with it, for it
has made them stumble into sin.
20They were proud of their beautiful
jewelry and used it to make their
detestable idols and vile images.
Therefore I will turn these into an
unclean thing for them.
21I will hand it all over as plunder to
foreigners and as loot to the wicked of
the earth, and they will defile it.
22I will turn my face away from them,
and they will desecrate my treasured
place; robbers will enter it and desecrate
it.
23"Prepare chains, because the land is
full of bloodshed and the city is full of
violence.
24I will bring the most wicked of the
nations to take possession of their
houses; I will put an end to the pride of
the mighty, and their sanctuaries will be
desecrated.
25When terror comes, they will seek
peace, but there will be none.
26Calamity upon calamity will come, and
rumor upon rumor. They will try to get a
vision from the prophet; the teaching of
the law by the priest will be lost, as will
the counsel of the elders.
27The king will mourn, the prince will be
clothed with despair, and the hands of
the people of the land will tremble. I will
deal with them according to their
conduct, and by their own standards I
will judge them. Then they will know that
I am the LORD ."
8In the sixth year, in the sixth month
on the fifth day, while I was sitting in my
house and the elders of Judah were
sitting before me, the hand of the
Sovereign LORD came upon me there.
2I looked, and I saw a figure like that of a
man. From what appeared to be his
waist down he was like fire, and from
there up his appearance was as bright
as glowing metal.
3He stretched out what looked like a
hand and took me by the hair of my
head. The Spirit lifted me up between
earth and heaven and in visions of God
he took me to Jerusalem, to the
entrance to the north gate of the inner
court, where the idol that provokes to
jealousy stood.
4And there before me was the glory of
the God of Israel, as in the vision I had
seen in the plain.
5Then he said to me, "Son of man, look
toward the north." So I looked, and in
the entrance north of the gate of the
altar I saw this idol of jealousy.
6And he said to me, "Son of man, do
you see what they are doing-the utterly
detestable things the house of Israel is
doing here, things that will drive me far
from my sanctuary? But you will see
things that are even more detestable."
7Then he brought me to the entrance to
the court. I looked, and I saw a hole in
the wall.
8He said to me, "Son of man, now dig
into the wall." So I dug into the wall and
saw a doorway there.
9And he said to me, "Go in and see the
wicked and detestable things they are
doing here."
10So I went in and looked, and I saw
portrayed all over the walls all kinds of
crawling things and detestable animals
and all the idols of the house of Israel.
11In front of them stood seventy elders
of the house of Israel, and Jaazaniah
son of Shaphan was standing among
them. Each had a censer in his hand,
and a fragrant cloud of incense was
rising.
12He said to me, "Son of man, have you
seen what the elders of the house of
Israel are doing in the darkness, each at
the shrine of his own idol? They say,
'The LORD does not see us; the LORD
has forsaken the land.' "
13Again, he said, "You will see them
doing things that are even more
detestable."
14Then he brought me to the entrance to
the north gate of the house of the
LORD , and I saw women sitting there,
mourning for Tammuz.
15He said to me, "Do you see this, son of
man? You will see things that are even
more detestable than this."
16He then brought me into the inner
court of the house of the LORD , and
there at the entrance to the temple,
between the portico and the altar, were
about twenty-five men. With their backs
toward the temple of the LORD and their
faces toward the east, they were bowing
down to the sun in the east.
17He said to me, "Have you seen this,
son of man? Is it a trivial matter for the
house of Judah to do the detestable
things they are doing here? Must they
also fill the land with violence and
continually provoke me to anger? Look
at them putting the branch to their nose!
18Therefore I will deal with them in
anger; I will not look on them with pity or
spare them. Although they shout in my
ears, I will not listen to them."
9Then I heard him call out in a loud
voice, "Bring the guards of the city here,
each with a weapon in his hand."
2And I saw six men coming from the
direction of the upper gate, which faces
north, each with a deadly weapon in his
hand. With them was a man clothed in
linen who had a writing kit at his side.
They came in and stood beside the
bronze altar.
3Now the glory of the God of Israel went
up from above the cherubim, where it
had been, and moved to the threshold of
the temple. Then the LORD called to the
man clothed in linen who had the writing
kit at his side
4and said to him, "Go throughout the city
of Jerusalem and put a mark on the
foreheads of those who grieve and
lament over all the detestable things that
are done in it."
5As I listened, he said to the others,
"Follow him through the city and kill,
without showing pity or compassion.
6Slaughter old men, young men and
maidens, women and children, but do
not touch anyone who has the mark.
Begin at my sanctuary." So they began
with the elders who were in front of the
temple.
7Then he said to them, "Defile the
temple and fill the courts with the slain.
Go!" So they went out and began killing
throughout the city.
8While they were killing and I was left
alone, I fell facedown, crying out, "Ah,
Sovereign LORD ! Are you going to
destroy the entire remnant of Israel in
this outpouring of your wrath on
Jerusalem?"
9He answered me, "The sin of the house
of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great;
the land is full of bloodshed and the city
is full of injustice. They say, 'The LORD
has forsaken the land; the LORD does
not see.'
10So I will not look on them with pity or
spare them, but I will bring down on their
own heads what they have done."
11Then the man in linen with the writing
kit at his side brought back word, saying,
"I have done as you commanded."
10I looked, and I saw the likeness of
a throne of sapphire above the expanse
that was over the heads of the cherubim.
2The LORD said to the man clothed in
linen, "Go in among the wheels beneath
the cherubim. Fill your hands with
burning coals from among the cherubim
and scatter them over the city." And as I
watched, he went in.
3Now the cherubim were standing on the
south side of the temple when the man
went in, and a cloud filled the inner court.
4Then the glory of the LORD rose from
above the cherubim and moved to the
threshold of the temple. The cloud filled
the temple, and the court was full of the
radiance of the glory of the LORD .
5The sound of the wings of the cherubim
could be heard as far away as the outer
court, like the voice of God Almighty
when he speaks.
6When the LORD commanded the man
in linen, "Take fire from among the
wheels, from among the cherubim," the
man went in and stood beside a wheel.
7Then one of the cherubim reached out
his hand to the fire that was among
them. He took up some of it and put it
into the hands of the man in linen, who
took it and went out.
8(Under the wings of the cherubim could
be seen what looked like the hands of a
man.)
9I looked, and I saw beside the cherubim
four wheels, one beside each of the
cherubim; the wheels sparkled like
chrysolite.
10As for their appearance, the four of
them looked alike; each was like a
wheel intersecting a wheel.
11As they moved, they would go in any
one of the four directions the cherubim
faced; the wheels did not turn about as
the cherubim went. The cherubim went
in whatever direction the head faced,
without turning as they went.
12Their entire bodies, including their
backs, their hands and their wings, were
completely full of eyes, as were their
four wheels.
13I heard the wheels being called "the
whirling wheels."
14Each of the cherubim had four faces:
One face was that of a cherub, the
second the face of a man, the third the
face of a lion, and the fourth the face of
an eagle.
15Then the cherubim rose upward.
These were the living creatures I had
seen by the Kebar River.
16When the cherubim moved, the
wheels beside them moved; and when
the cherubim spread their wings to rise
from the ground, the wheels did not
leave their side.
17When the cherubim stood still, they
also stood still; and when the cherubim
rose, they rose with them, because the
spirit of the living creatures was in them.
18Then the glory of the LORD departed
from over the threshold of the temple
and stopped above the cherubim.
19While I watched, the cherubim spread
their wings and rose from the ground,
and as they went, the wheels went with
them. They stopped at the entrance to
the east gate of the LORD 's house, and
the glory of the God of Israel was above
them.
20These were the living creatures I had
seen beneath the God of Israel by the
Kebar River, and I realized that they
were cherubim.
21Each had four faces and four wings,
and under their wings was what looked
like the hands of a man.
22Their faces had the same appearance
as those I had seen by the Kebar River.
Each one went straight ahead.
11Then the Spirit lifted me up and
brought me to the gate of the house of
the LORD that faces east. There at the
entrance to the gate were twenty-five
men, and I saw among them Jaazaniah
son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of
Benaiah, leaders of the people.
2The LORD said to me, "Son of man,
these are the men who are plotting evil
and giving wicked advice in this city.
3They say, 'Will it not soon be time to
build houses? This city is a cooking pot,
and we are the meat.'
4Therefore prophesy against them;
prophesy, son of man."
5Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon
me, and he told me to say: "This is what
the LORD says: That is what you are
saying, O house of Israel, but I know
what is going through your mind.
6You have killed many people in this city
and filled its streets with the dead.
7"Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: The bodies you have
thrown there are the meat and this city
is the pot, but I will drive you out of it.
8You fear the sword, and the sword is
what I will bring against you, declares
the Sovereign LORD .
9I will drive you out of the city and hand
you over to foreigners and inflict
punishment on you.
10You will fall by the sword, and I will
execute judgment on you at the borders
of Israel. Then you will know that I am
the LORD .
11This city will not be a pot for you, nor
will you be the meat in it; I will execute
judgment on you at the borders of Israel.
12And you will know that I am the LORD ,
for you have not followed my decrees or
kept my laws but have conformed to the
standards of the nations around you."
13Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah
son of Benaiah died. Then I fell
facedown and cried out in a loud voice,
"Ah, Sovereign LORD ! Will you
completely destroy the remnant of
Israel?"
14The word of the LORD came to me:
15"Son of man, your brothers-your
brothers who are your blood relatives
and the whole house of Israel-are those
of whom the people of Jerusalem have
said, 'They are far away from the
LORD ; this land was given to us as our
possession.'
16"Therefore say: 'This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: Although I sent
them far away among the nations and
scattered them among the countries, yet
for a little while I have been a sanctuary
for them in the countries where they
have gone.'
17"Therefore say: 'This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: I will gather you
from the nations and bring you back
from the countries where you have been
scattered, and I will give you back the
land of Israel again.'
18"They will return to it and remove all its
vile images and detestable idols.
19I will give them an undivided heart and
put a new spirit in them; I will remove
from them their heart of stone and give
them a heart of flesh.
20Then they will follow my decrees and
be careful to keep my laws. They will be
my people, and I will be their God.
21But as for those whose hearts are
devoted to their vile images and
detestable idols, I will bring down on
their own heads what they have done,
declares the Sovereign LORD ."
22Then the cherubim, with the wheels
beside them, spread their wings, and
the glory of the God of Israel was above
them.
23The glory of the LORD went up from
within the city and stopped above the
mountain east of it.
24The Spirit lifted me up and brought me
to the exiles in Babylonia in the vision
given by the Spirit of God. Then the
vision I had seen went up from me,
25and I told the exiles everything the
LORD had shown me.
12The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"Son of man, you are living among a
rebellious people. They have eyes to
see but do not see and ears to hear but
do not hear, for they are a rebellious
people.
3"Therefore, son of man, pack your
belongings for exile and in the daytime,
as they watch, set out and go from
where you are to another place.
Perhaps they will understand, though
they are a rebellious house.
4During the daytime, while they watch,
bring out your belongings packed for
exile. Then in the evening, while they
are watching, go out like those who go
into exile.
5While they watch, dig through the wall
and take your belongings out through it.
6Put them on your shoulder as they are
watching and carry them out at dusk.
Cover your face so that you cannot see
the land, for I have made you a sign to
the house of Israel."
7So I did as I was commanded. During
the day I brought out my things packed
for exile. Then in the evening I dug
through the wall with my hands. I took
my belongings out at dusk, carrying
them on my shoulders while they
watched.
8In the morning the word of the LORD
came to me:
9"Son of man, did not that rebellious
house of Israel ask you, 'What are you
doing?'
10"Say to them, 'This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: This oracle
concerns the prince in Jerusalem and
the whole house of Israel who are there.'
11Say to them, 'I am a sign to you.' "As I
have done, so it will be done to them.
They will go into exile as captives.
12"The prince among them will put his
things on his shoulder at dusk and leave,
and a hole will be dug in the wall for him
to go through. He will cover his face so
that he cannot see the land.
13I will spread my net for him, and he will
be caught in my snare; I will bring him to
Babylonia, the land of the Chaldeans,
but he will not see it, and there he will
die.
14I will scatter to the winds all those
around him-his staff and all his troopsand
I will pursue them with drawn sword.
15"They will know that I am the LORD ,
when I disperse them among the
nations and scatter them through the
countries.
16But I will spare a few of them from the
sword, famine and plague, so that in the
nations where they go they may
acknowledge all their detestable
practices. Then they will know that I am
the LORD ."
17The word of the LORD came to me:
18"Son of man, tremble as you eat your
food, and shudder in fear as you drink
your water.
19Say to the people of the land: 'This is
what the Sovereign LORD says about
those living in Jerusalem and in the land
of Israel: They will eat their food in
anxiety and drink their water in despair,
for their land will be stripped of
everything in it because of the violence
of all who live there.
20The inhabited towns will be laid waste
and the land will be desolate. Then you
will know that I am the LORD .' "
21The word of the LORD came to me:
22"Son of man, what is this proverb you
have in the land of Israel: 'The days go
by and every vision comes to nothing'?
23Say to them, 'This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: I am going to put
an end to this proverb, and they will no
longer quote it in Israel.' Say to them,
'The days are near when every vision
will be fulfilled.
24For there will be no more false visions
or flattering divinations among the
people of Israel.
25But I the LORD will speak what I will,
and it shall be fulfilled without delay. For
in your days, you rebellious house, I will
fulfill whatever I say, declares the
Sovereign LORD .' "
26The word of the LORD came to me:
27"Son of man, the house of Israel is
saying, 'The vision he sees is for many
years from now, and he prophesies
about the distant future.'
28"Therefore say to them, 'This is what
the Sovereign LORD says: None of my
words will be delayed any longer;
whatever I say will be fulfilled, declares
the Sovereign LORD .' "
13The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"Son of man, prophesy against the
prophets of Israel who are now
prophesying. Say to those who
prophesy out of their own imagination:
'Hear the word of the LORD !
3This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
Woe to the foolish prophets who follow
their own spirit and have seen nothing!
4Your prophets, O Israel, are like jackals
among ruins.
5You have not gone up to the breaks in
the wall to repair it for the house of
Israel so that it will stand firm in the
battle on the day of the LORD .
6Their visions are false and their
divinations a lie. They say, "The LORD
declares," when the LORD has not sent
them; yet they expect their words to be
fulfilled.
7Have you not seen false visions and
uttered lying divinations when you say,
"The LORD declares," though I have not
spoken?
8" 'Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: Because of your false
words and lying visions, I am against
you, declares the Sovereign LORD .
9My hand will be against the prophets
who see false visions and utter lying
divinations. They will not belong to the
council of my people or be listed in the
records of the house of Israel, nor will
they enter the land of Israel. Then you
will know that I am the Sovereign LORD .
10" 'Because they lead my people astray,
saying, "Peace," when there is no peace,
and because, when a flimsy wall is built,
they cover it with whitewash,
11therefore tell those who cover it with
whitewash that it is going to fall. Rain
will come in torrents, and I will send
hailstones hurtling down, and violent
winds will burst forth.
12When the wall collapses, will people
not ask you, "Where is the whitewash
you covered it with?"
13" 'Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: In my wrath I will unleash a
violent wind, and in my anger hailstones
and torrents of rain will fall with
destructive fury.
14I will tear down the wall you have
covered with whitewash and will level it
to the ground so that its foundation will
be laid bare. When it falls, you will be
destroyed in it; and you will know that I
am the LORD .
15So I will spend my wrath against the
wall and against those who covered it
with whitewash. I will say to you, "The
wall is gone and so are those who
whitewashed it,
16those prophets of Israel who
prophesied to Jerusalem and saw
visions of peace for her when there was
no peace, declares the Sovereign
LORD ." '
17"Now, son of man, set your face
against the daughters of your people
who prophesy out of their own
imagination. Prophesy against them
18and say, 'This is what the Sovereign
LORD says: Woe to the women who
sew magic charms on all their wrists and
make veils of various lengths for their
heads in order to ensnare people. Will
you ensnare the lives of my people but
preserve your own?
19You have profaned me among my
people for a few handfuls of barley and
scraps of bread. By lying to my people,
who listen to lies, you have killed those
who should not have died and have
spared those who should not live.
20" 'Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: I am against your magic
charms with which you ensnare people
like birds and I will tear them from your
arms; I will set free the people that you
ensnare like birds.
21I will tear off your veils and save my
people from your hands, and they will no
longer fall prey to your power. Then you
will know that I am the LORD .
22Because you disheartened the
righteous with your lies, when I had
brought them no grief, and because you
encouraged the wicked not to turn from
their evil ways and so save their lives,
23therefore you will no longer see false
visions or practice divination. I will save
my people from your hands. And then
you will know that I am the LORD .' "
14Some of the elders of Israel came
to me and sat down in front of me.
2Then the word of the LORD came to
me:
3"Son of man, these men have set up
idols in their hearts and put wicked
stumbling blocks before their faces.
Should I let them inquire of me at all?
4Therefore speak to them and tell them,
'This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
When any Israelite sets up idols in his
heart and puts a wicked stumbling block
before his face and then goes to a
prophet, I the LORD will answer him
myself in keeping with his great idolatry.
5I will do this to recapture the hearts of
the people of Israel, who have all
deserted me for their idols.'
6"Therefore say to the house of Israel,
'This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
Repent! Turn from your idols and
renounce all your detestable practices!
7" 'When any Israelite or any alien living
in Israel separates himself from me and
sets up idols in his heart and puts a
wicked stumbling block before his face
and then goes to a prophet to inquire of
me, I the LORD will answer him myself.
8I will set my face against that man and
make him an example and a byword. I
will cut him off from my people. Then
you will know that I am the LORD .
9" 'And if the prophet is enticed to utter a
prophecy, I the LORD have enticed that
prophet, and I will stretch out my hand
against him and destroy him from
among my people Israel.
10They will bear their guilt-the prophet
will be as guilty as the one who consults
him.
11Then the people of Israel will no longer
stray from me, nor will they defile
themselves anymore with all their sins.
They will be my people, and I will be
their God, declares the Sovereign
LORD .' "
12The word of the LORD came to me:
13"Son of man, if a country sins against
me by being unfaithful and I stretch out
my hand against it to cut off its food
supply and send famine upon it and kill
its men and their animals,
14even if these three men-Noah, Daniel
and Job-were in it, they could save only
themselves by their righteousness,
declares the Sovereign LORD .
15"Or if I send wild beasts through that
country and they leave it childless and it
becomes desolate so that no one can
pass through it because of the beasts,
16as surely as I live, declares the
Sovereign LORD , even if these three
men were in it, they could not save their
own sons or daughters. They alone
would be saved, but the land would be
desolate.
17"Or if I bring a sword against that
country and say, 'Let the sword pass
throughout the land,' and I kill its men
and their animals,
18as surely as I live, declares the
Sovereign LORD , even if these three
men were in it, they could not save their
own sons or daughters. They alone
would be saved.
19"Or if I send a plague into that land
and pour out my wrath upon it through
bloodshed, killing its men and their
animals,
20as surely as I live, declares the
Sovereign LORD , even if Noah, Daniel
and Job were in it, they could save
neither son nor daughter. They would
save only themselves by their
righteousness.
21"For this is what the Sovereign LORD
says: How much worse will it be when I
send against Jerusalem my four
dreadful judgments-sword and famine
and wild beasts and plague-to kill its
men and their animals!
22Yet there will be some survivors-sons
and daughters who will be brought out
of it. They will come to you, and when
you see their conduct and their actions,
you will be consoled regarding the
disaster I have brought upon Jerusalemevery
disaster I have brought upon it.
23You will be consoled when you see
their conduct and their actions, for you
will know that I have done nothing in it
without cause, declares the Sovereign
LORD ."
15The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"Son of man, how is the wood of a vine
better than that of a branch on any of
the trees in the forest?
3Is wood ever taken from it to make
anything useful? Do they make pegs
from it to hang things on?
4And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel
and the fire burns both ends and chars
the middle, is it then useful for anything?
5If it was not useful for anything when it
was whole, how much less can it be
made into something useful when the
fire has burned it and it is charred?
6"Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: As I have given the wood of
the vine among the trees of the forest as
fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people
living in Jerusalem.
7I will set my face against them.
Although they have come out of the fire,
the fire will yet consume them. And
when I set my face against them, you
will know that I am the LORD .
8I will make the land desolate because
they have been unfaithful, declares the
Sovereign LORD ."
16The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"Son of man, confront Jerusalem with
her detestable practices
3and say, 'This is what the Sovereign
LORD says to Jerusalem: Your ancestry
and birth were in the land of the
Canaanites; your father was an Amorite
and your mother a Hittite.
4On the day you were born your cord
was not cut, nor were you washed with
water to make you clean, nor were you
rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths.
5No one looked on you with pity or had
compassion enough to do any of these
things for you. Rather, you were thrown
out into the open field, for on the day
you were born you were despised.
6" 'Then I passed by and saw you
kicking about in your blood, and as you
lay there in your blood I said to you,
"Live!"
7I made you grow like a plant of the field.
You grew up and developed and
became the most beautiful of jewels.
Your breasts were formed and your hair
grew, you who were naked and bare.
8" 'Later I passed by, and when I looked
at you and saw that you were old
enough for love, I spread the corner of
my garment over you and covered your
nakedness. I gave you my solemn oath
and entered into a covenant with you,
declares the Sovereign LORD , and you
became mine.
9" 'I bathed you with water and washed
the blood from you and put ointments on
you.
10I clothed you with an embroidered
dress and put leather sandals on you. I
dressed you in fine linen and covered
you with costly garments.
11I adorned you with jewelry: I put
bracelets on your arms and a necklace
around your neck,
12and I put a ring on your nose, earrings
on your ears and a beautiful crown on
your head.
13So you were adorned with gold and
silver; your clothes were of fine linen
and costly fabric and embroidered cloth.
Your food was fine flour, honey and
olive oil. You became very beautiful and
rose to be a queen.
14And your fame spread among the
nations on account of your beauty,
because the splendor I had given you
made your beauty perfect, declares the
Sovereign LORD .
15" 'But you trusted in your beauty and
used your fame to become a prostitute.
You lavished your favors on anyone
who passed by and your beauty became
his.
16You took some of your garments to
make gaudy high places, where you
carried on your prostitution. Such things
should not happen, nor should they ever
occur.
17You also took the fine jewelry I gave
you, the jewelry made of my gold and
silver, and you made for yourself male
idols and engaged in prostitution with
them.
18And you took your embroidered
clothes to put on them, and you offered
my oil and incense before them.
19Also the food I provided for you-the
fine flour, olive oil and honey I gave you
to eat-you offered as fragrant incense
before them. That is what happened,
declares the Sovereign LORD .
20" 'And you took your sons and
daughters whom you bore to me and
sacrificed them as food to the idols. Was
your prostitution not enough?
21You slaughtered my children and
sacrificed them to the idols.
22In all your detestable practices and
your prostitution you did not remember
the days of your youth, when you were
naked and bare, kicking about in your
blood.
23" 'Woe! Woe to you, declares the
Sovereign LORD . In addition to all your
other wickedness,
24you built a mound for yourself and
made a lofty shrine in every public
square.
25At the head of every street you built
your lofty shrines and degraded your
beauty, offering your body with
increasing promiscuity to anyone who
passed by.
26You engaged in prostitution with the
Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and
provoked me to anger with your
increasing promiscuity.
27So I stretched out my hand against
you and reduced your territory; I gave
you over to the greed of your enemies,
the daughters of the Philistines, who
were shocked by your lewd conduct.
28You engaged in prostitution with the
Assyrians too, because you were
insatiable; and even after that, you still
were not satisfied.
29Then you increased your promiscuity
to include Babylonia, a land of
merchants, but even with this you were
not satisfied.
30" 'How weak-willed you are, declares
the Sovereign LORD , when you do all
these things, acting like a brazen
prostitute!
31When you built your mounds at the
head of every street and made your lofty
shrines in every public square, you were
unlike a prostitute, because you scorned
payment.
32" 'You adulterous wife! You prefer
strangers to your own husband!
33Every prostitute receives a fee, but
you give gifts to all your lovers, bribing
them to come to you from everywhere
for your illicit favors.
34So in your prostitution you are the
opposite of others; no one runs after you
for your favors. You are the very
opposite, for you give payment and
none is given to you.
35" 'Therefore, you prostitute, hear the
word of the LORD !
36This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: Because you poured out your
wealth and exposed your nakedness in
your promiscuity with your lovers, and
because of all your detestable idols, and
because you gave them your children's
blood,
37therefore I am going to gather all your
lovers, with whom you found pleasure,
those you loved as well as those you
hated. I will gather them against you
from all around and will strip you in front
of them, and they will see all your
nakedness.
38I will sentence you to the punishment
of women who commit adultery and who
shed blood; I will bring upon you the
blood vengeance of my wrath and
jealous anger.
39Then I will hand you over to your
lovers, and they will tear down your
mounds and destroy your lofty shrines.
They will strip you of your clothes and
take your fine jewelry and leave you
naked and bare.
40They will bring a mob against you, who
will stone you and hack you to pieces
with their swords.
41They will burn down your houses and
inflict punishment on you in the sight of
many women. I will put a stop to your
prostitution, and you will no longer pay
your lovers.
42Then my wrath against you will
subside and my jealous anger will turn
away from you; I will be calm and no
longer angry.
43" 'Because you did not remember the
days of your youth but enraged me with
all these things, I will surely bring down
on your head what you have done,
declares the Sovereign LORD . Did you
not add lewdness to all your other
detestable practices?
44" 'Everyone who quotes proverbs will
quote this proverb about you: "Like
mother, like daughter."
45You are a true daughter of your
mother, who despised her husband and
her children; and you are a true sister of
your sisters, who despised their
husbands and their children. Your
mother was a Hittite and your father an
Amorite.
46Your older sister was Samaria, who
lived to the north of you with her
daughters; and your younger sister, who
lived to the south of you with her
daughters, was Sodom.
47You not only walked in their ways and
copied their detestable practices, but in
all your ways you soon became more
depraved than they.
48As surely as I live, declares the
Sovereign LORD , your sister Sodom
and her daughters never did what you
and your daughters have done.
49" 'Now this was the sin of your sister
Sodom: She and her daughters were
arrogant, overfed and unconcerned;
they did not help the poor and needy.
50They were haughty and did detestable
things before me. Therefore I did away
with them as you have seen.
51Samaria did not commit half the sins
you did. You have done more detestable
things than they, and have made your
sisters seem righteous by all these
things you have done.
52Bear your disgrace, for you have
furnished some justification for your
sisters. Because your sins were more
vile than theirs, they appear more
righteous than you. So then, be
ashamed and bear your disgrace, for
you have made your sisters appear
righteous.
53" 'However, I will restore the fortunes
of Sodom and her daughters and of
Samaria and her daughters, and your
fortunes along with them,
54so that you may bear your disgrace
and be ashamed of all you have done in
giving them comfort.
55And your sisters, Sodom with her
daughters and Samaria with her
daughters, will return to what they were
before; and you and your daughters will
return to what you were before.
56You would not even mention your
sister Sodom in the day of your pride,
57before your wickedness was
uncovered. Even so, you are now
scorned by the daughters of Edom and
all her neighbors and the daughters of
the Philistines-all those around you who
despise you.
58You will bear the consequences of
your lewdness and your detestable
practices, declares the LORD .
59" 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: I will deal with you as you deserve,
because you have despised my oath by
breaking the covenant.
60Yet I will remember the covenant I
made with you in the days of your youth,
and I will establish an everlasting
covenant with you.
61Then you will remember your ways
and be ashamed when you receive your
sisters, both those who are older than
you and those who are younger. I will
give them to you as daughters, but not
on the basis of my covenant with you.
62So I will establish my covenant with
you, and you will know that I am the
LORD .
63Then, when I make atonement for you
for all you have done, you will remember
and be ashamed and never again open
your mouth because of your humiliation,
declares the Sovereign LORD .' "
17The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"Son of man, set forth an allegory and
tell the house of Israel a parable.
3Say to them, 'This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: A great eagle
with powerful wings, long feathers and
full plumage of varied colors came to
Lebanon. Taking hold of the top of a
cedar,
4he broke off its topmost shoot and
carried it away to a land of merchants,
where he planted it in a city of traders.
5" 'He took some of the seed of your
land and put it in fertile soil. He planted
it like a willow by abundant water,
6and it sprouted and became a low,
spreading vine. Its branches turned
toward him, but its roots remained under
it. So it became a vine and produced
branches and put out leafy boughs.
7" 'But there was another great eagle
with powerful wings and full plumage.
The vine now sent out its roots toward
him from the plot where it was planted
and stretched out its branches to him for
water.
8It had been planted in good soil by
abundant water so that it would produce
branches, bear fruit and become a
splendid vine.'
9"Say to them, 'This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: Will it thrive?
Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its
fruit so that it withers? All its new growth
will wither. It will not take a strong arm
or many people to pull it up by the roots.
10Even if it is transplanted, will it thrive?
Will it not wither completely when the
east wind strikes it-wither away in the
plot where it grew?' "
11Then the word of the LORD came to
me:
12"Say to this rebellious house, 'Do you
not know what these things mean?' Say
to them: 'The king of Babylon went to
Jerusalem and carried off her king and
her nobles, bringing them back with him
to Babylon.
13Then he took a member of the royal
family and made a treaty with him,
putting him under oath. He also carried
away the leading men of the land,
14so that the kingdom would be brought
low, unable to rise again, surviving only
by keeping his treaty.
15But the king rebelled against him by
sending his envoys to Egypt to get
horses and a large army. Will he
succeed? Will he who does such things
escape? Will he break the treaty and yet
escape?
16" 'As surely as I live, declares the
Sovereign LORD , he shall die in
Babylon, in the land of the king who put
him on the throne, whose oath he
despised and whose treaty he broke.
17Pharaoh with his mighty army and
great horde will be of no help to him in
war, when ramps are built and siege
works erected to destroy many lives.
18He despised the oath by breaking the
covenant. Because he had given his
hand in pledge and yet did all these
things, he shall not escape.
19" 'Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: As surely as I live, I will
bring down on his head my oath that he
despised and my covenant that he
broke.
20I will spread my net for him, and he will
be caught in my snare. I will bring him to
Babylon and execute judgment upon
him there because he was unfaithful to
me.
21All his fleeing troops will fall by the
sword, and the survivors will be
scattered to the winds. Then you will
know that I the LORD have spoken.
22" 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: I myself will take a shoot from the
very top of a cedar and plant it; I will
break off a tender sprig from its topmost
shoots and plant it on a high and lofty
mountain.
23On the mountain heights of Israel I will
plant it; it will produce branches and
bear fruit and become a splendid cedar.
Birds of every kind will nest in it; they
will find shelter in the shade of its
branches.
24All the trees of the field will know that I
the LORD bring down the tall tree and
make the low tree grow tall. I dry up the
green tree and make the dry tree
flourish. " 'I the LORD have spoken, and
I will do it.' "
18The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"What do you people mean by quoting
this proverb about the land of Israel: "
'The fathers eat sour grapes, and the
children's teeth are set on edge'?
3"As surely as I live, declares the
Sovereign LORD , you will no longer
quote this proverb in Israel.
4For every living soul belongs to me, the
father as well as the son-both alike
belong to me. The soul who sins is the
one who will die.
5"Suppose there is a righteous man who
does what is just and right.
6He does not eat at the mountain
shrines or look to the idols of the house
of Israel. He does not defile his
neighbor's wife or lie with a woman
during her period.
7He does not oppress anyone, but
returns what he took in pledge for a loan.
He does not commit robbery but gives
his food to the hungry and provides
clothing for the naked.
8He does not lend at usury or take
excessive interest. He withholds his
hand from doing wrong and judges fairly
between man and man.
9He follows my decrees and faithfully
keeps my laws. That man is righteous;
he will surely live, declares the
Sovereign LORD .
10"Suppose he has a violent son, who
sheds blood or does any of these other
things
11(though the father has done none of
them): "He eats at the mountain shrines.
He defiles his neighbor's wife.
12He oppresses the poor and needy. He
commits robbery. He does not return
what he took in pledge. He looks to the
idols. He does detestable things.
13He lends at usury and takes excessive
interest. Will such a man live? He will
not! Because he has done all these
detestable things, he will surely be put
to death and his blood will be on his own
head.
14"But suppose this son has a son who
sees all the sins his father commits, and
though he sees them, he does not do
such things:
15"He does not eat at the mountain
shrines or look to the idols of the house
of Israel. He does not defile his
neighbor's wife.
16He does not oppress anyone or
require a pledge for a loan. He does not
commit robbery but gives his food to the
hungry and provides clothing for the
naked.
17He withholds his hand from sin and
takes no usury or excessive interest. He
keeps my laws and follows my decrees.
He will not die for his father's sin; he will
surely live.
18But his father will die for his own sin,
because he practiced extortion, robbed
his brother and did what was wrong
among his people.
19"Yet you ask, 'Why does the son not
share the guilt of his father?' Since the
son has done what is just and right and
has been careful to keep all my decrees,
he will surely live.
20The soul who sins is the one who will
die. The son will not share the guilt of
the father, nor will the father share the
guilt of the son. The righteousness of
the righteous man will be credited to him,
and the wickedness of the wicked will be
charged against him.
21"But if a wicked man turns away from
all the sins he has committed and keeps
all my decrees and does what is just
and right, he will surely live; he will not
die.
22None of the offenses he has
committed will be remembered against
him. Because of the righteous things he
has done, he will live.
23Do I take any pleasure in the death of
the wicked? declares the Sovereign
LORD . Rather, am I not pleased when
they turn from their ways and live?
24"But if a righteous man turns from his
righteousness and commits sin and
does the same detestable things the
wicked man does, will he live? None of
the righteous things he has done will be
remembered. Because of the
unfaithfulness he is guilty of and
because of the sins he has committed,
he will die.
25"Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is
not just.' Hear, O house of Israel: Is my
way unjust? Is it not your ways that are
unjust?
26If a righteous man turns from his
righteousness and commits sin, he will
die for it; because of the sin he has
committed he will die.
27But if a wicked man turns away from
the wickedness he has committed and
does what is just and right, he will save
his life.
28Because he considers all the offenses
he has committed and turns away from
them, he will surely live; he will not die.
29Yet the house of Israel says, 'The way
of the Lord is not just.' Are my ways
unjust, O house of Israel? Is it not your
ways that are unjust?
30"Therefore, O house of Israel, I will
judge you, each one according to his
ways, declares the Sovereign LORD .
Repent! Turn away from all your
offenses; then sin will not be your
downfall.
31Rid yourselves of all the offenses you
have committed, and get a new heart
and a new spirit. Why will you die, O
house of Israel?
32For I take no pleasure in the death of
anyone, declares the Sovereign LORD .
Repent and live!
19"Take up a lament concerning the
princes of Israel
2and say: " 'What a lioness was your
mother among the lions! She lay down
among the young lions and reared her
cubs.
3She brought up one of her cubs, and he
became a strong lion. He learned to tear
the prey and he devoured men.
4The nations heard about him, and he
was trapped in their pit. They led him
with hooks to the land of Egypt.
5" 'When she saw her hope unfulfilled,
her expectation gone, she took another
of her cubs and made him a strong lion.
6He prowled among the lions, for he was
now a strong lion. He learned to tear the
prey and he devoured men.
7He broke down their strongholds and
devastated their towns. The land and all
who were in it were terrified by his
roaring.
8Then the nations came against him,
those from regions round about. They
spread their net for him, and he was
trapped in their pit.
9With hooks they pulled him into a cage
and brought him to the king of Babylon.
They put him in prison, so his roar was
heard no longer on the mountains of
Israel.
10" 'Your mother was like a vine in your
vineyard planted by the water; it was
fruitful and full of branches because of
abundant water.
11Its branches were strong, fit for a
ruler's scepter. It towered high above
the thick foliage, conspicuous for its
height and for its many branches.
12But it was uprooted in fury and thrown
to the ground. The east wind made it
shrivel, it was stripped of its fruit; its
strong branches withered and fire
consumed them.
13Now it is planted in the desert, in a dry
and thirsty land.
14Fire spread from one of its main
branches and consumed its fruit. No
strong branch is left on it fit for a ruler's
scepter.' This is a lament and is to be
used as a lament."
20In the seventh year, in the fifth
month on the tenth day, some of the
elders of Israel came to inquire of the
LORD , and they sat down in front of me.
2Then the word of the LORD came to
me:
3"Son of man, speak to the elders of
Israel and say to them, 'This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: Have you come
to inquire of me? As surely as I live, I
will not let you inquire of me, declares
the Sovereign LORD .'
4"Will you judge them? Will you judge
them, son of man? Then confront them
with the detestable practices of their
fathers
5and say to them: 'This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: On the day I
chose Israel, I swore with uplifted hand
to the descendants of the house of
Jacob and revealed myself to them in
Egypt. With uplifted hand I said to them,
"I am the LORD your God."
6On that day I swore to them that I
would bring them out of Egypt into a
land I had searched out for them, a land
flowing with milk and honey, the most
beautiful of all lands.
7And I said to them, "Each of you, get rid
of the vile images you have set your
eyes on, and do not defile yourselves
with the idols of Egypt. I am the LORD
your God."
8" 'But they rebelled against me and
would not listen to me; they did not get
rid of the vile images they had set their
eyes on, nor did they forsake the idols of
Egypt. So I said I would pour out my
wrath on them and spend my anger
against them in Egypt.
9But for the sake of my name I did what
would keep it from being profaned in the
eyes of the nations they lived among
and in whose sight I had revealed
myself to the Israelites by bringing them
out of Egypt.
10Therefore I led them out of Egypt and
brought them into the desert.
11I gave them my decrees and made
known to them my laws, for the man
who obeys them will live by them.
12Also I gave them my Sabbaths as a
sign between us, so they would know
that I the LORD made them holy.
13" 'Yet the people of Israel rebelled
against me in the desert. They did not
follow my decrees but rejected my lawsalthough
the man who obeys them will
live by them-and they utterly desecrated
my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out
my wrath on them and destroy them in
the desert.
14But for the sake of my name I did what
would keep it from being profaned in the
eyes of the nations in whose sight I had
brought them out.
15Also with uplifted hand I swore to them
in the desert that I would not bring them
into the land I had given them-a land
flowing with milk and honey, most
beautiful of all lands-
16because they rejected my laws and did
not follow my decrees and desecrated
my Sabbaths. For their hearts were
devoted to their idols.
17Yet I looked on them with pity and did
not destroy them or put an end to them
in the desert.
18I said to their children in the desert,
"Do not follow the statutes of your
fathers or keep their laws or defile
yourselves with their idols.
19I am the LORD your God; follow my
decrees and be careful to keep my laws.
20Keep my Sabbaths holy, that they may
be a sign between us. Then you will
know that I am the LORD your God."
21" 'But the children rebelled against me:
They did not follow my decrees, they
were not careful to keep my lawsalthough
the man who obeys them will
live by them-and they desecrated my
Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out my
wrath on them and spend my anger
against them in the desert.
22But I withheld my hand, and for the
sake of my name I did what would keep
it from being profaned in the eyes of the
nations in whose sight I had brought
them out.
23Also with uplifted hand I swore to them
in the desert that I would disperse them
among the nations and scatter them
through the countries,
24because they had not obeyed my laws
but had rejected my decrees and
desecrated my Sabbaths, and their eyes
lusted after their fathers' idols.
25I also gave them over to statutes that
were not good and laws they could not
live by;
26I let them become defiled through their
gifts-the sacrifice of every firstborn -that
I might fill them with horror so they
would know that I am the LORD .'
27"Therefore, son of man, speak to the
people of Israel and say to them, 'This is
what the Sovereign LORD says: In this
also your fathers blasphemed me by
forsaking me:
28When I brought them into the land I
had sworn to give them and they saw
any high hill or any leafy tree, there they
offered their sacrifices, made offerings
that provoked me to anger, presented
their fragrant incense and poured out
their drink offerings.
29Then I said to them: What is this high
place you go to?' " (It is called Bamah to
this day.)
30"Therefore say to the house of Israel:
'This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
Will you defile yourselves the way your
fathers did and lust after their vile
images?
31When you offer your gifts-the sacrifice
of your sons in the fire-you continue to
defile yourselves with all your idols to
this day. Am I to let you inquire of me, O
house of Israel? As surely as I live,
declares the Sovereign LORD , I will not
let you inquire of me.
32" 'You say, "We want to be like the
nations, like the peoples of the world,
who serve wood and stone." But what
you have in mind will never happen.
33As surely as I live, declares the
Sovereign LORD , I will rule over you
with a mighty hand and an outstretched
arm and with outpoured wrath.
34I will bring you from the nations and
gather you from the countries where you
have been scattered-with a mighty hand
and an outstretched arm and with
outpoured wrath.
35I will bring you into the desert of the
nations and there, face to face, I will
execute judgment upon you.
36As I judged your fathers in the desert
of the land of Egypt, so I will judge you,
declares the Sovereign LORD .
37I will take note of you as you pass
under my rod, and I will bring you into
the bond of the covenant.
38I will purge you of those who revolt
and rebel against me. Although I will
bring them out of the land where they
are living, yet they will not enter the land
of Israel. Then you will know that I am
the LORD .
39" 'As for you, O house of Israel, this is
what the Sovereign LORD says: Go and
serve your idols, every one of you! But
afterward you will surely listen to me
and no longer profane my holy name
with your gifts and idols.
40For on my holy mountain, the high
mountain of Israel, declares the
Sovereign LORD , there in the land the
entire house of Israel will serve me, and
there I will accept them. There I will
require your offerings and your choice
gifts, along with all your holy sacrifices.
41I will accept you as fragrant incense
when I bring you out from the nations
and gather you from the countries where
you have been scattered, and I will
show myself holy among you in the sight
of the nations.
42Then you will know that I am the
LORD , when I bring you into the land of
Israel, the land I had sworn with uplifted
hand to give to your fathers.
43There you will remember your conduct
and all the actions by which you have
defiled yourselves, and you will loathe
yourselves for all the evil you have done.
44You will know that I am the LORD ,
when I deal with you for my name's sake
and not according to your evil ways and
your corrupt practices, O house of Israel,
declares the Sovereign LORD .' "
45The word of the LORD came to me:
46"Son of man, set your face toward the
south; preach against the south and
prophesy against the forest of the
southland.
47Say to the southern forest: 'Hear the
word of the LORD . This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: I am about to set
fire to you, and it will consume all your
trees, both green and dry. The blazing
flame will not be quenched, and every
face from south to north will be scorched
by it.
48Everyone will see that I the LORD
have kindled it; it will not be quenched.' "
49Then I said, "Ah, Sovereign LORD !
They are saying of me, 'Isn't he just
telling parables?' "
21The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"Son of man, set your face against
Jerusalem and preach against the
sanctuary. Prophesy against the land of
Israel
3and say to her: 'This is what the LORD
says: I am against you. I will draw my
sword from its scabbard and cut off from
you both the righteous and the wicked.
4Because I am going to cut off the
righteous and the wicked, my sword will
be unsheathed against everyone from
south to north.
5Then all people will know that I the
LORD have drawn my sword from its
scabbard; it will not return again.'
6"Therefore groan, son of man! Groan
before them with broken heart and bitter
grief.
7And when they ask you, 'Why are you
groaning?' you shall say, 'Because of
the news that is coming. Every heart will
melt and every hand go limp; every spirit
will become faint and every knee
become as weak as water.' It is coming!
It will surely take place, declares the
Sovereign LORD ."
8The word of the LORD came to me:
9"Son of man, prophesy and say, 'This is
what the Lord says: " 'A sword, a sword,
sharpened and polished-
10sharpened for the slaughter, polished
to flash like lightning! " 'Shall we rejoice
in the scepter of my son Judah ? The
sword despises every such stick.
11" 'The sword is appointed to be
polished, to be grasped with the hand; it
is sharpened and polished, made ready
for the hand of the slayer.
12Cry out and wail, son of man, for it is
against my people; it is against all the
princes of Israel. They are thrown to the
sword along with my people. Therefore
beat your breast.
13" 'Testing will surely come. And what if
the scepter of Judah , which the sword
despises, does not continue? declares
the Sovereign LORD .'
14"So then, son of man, prophesy and
strike your hands together. Let the
sword strike twice, even three times. It is
a sword for slaughter- a sword for great
slaughter, closing in on them from every
side.
15So that hearts may melt and the fallen
be many, I have stationed the sword for
slaughter at all their gates. Oh! It is
made to flash like lightning, it is grasped
for slaughter.
16O sword, slash to the right, then to the
left, wherever your blade is turned.
17I too will strike my hands together, and
my wrath will subside. I the LORD have
spoken."
18The word of the LORD came to me:
19"Son of man, mark out two roads for
the sword of the king of Babylon to take,
both starting from the same country.
Make a signpost where the road
branches off to the city.
20Mark out one road for the sword to
come against Rabbah of the Ammonites
and another against Judah and fortified
Jerusalem.
21For the king of Babylon will stop at the
fork in the road, at the junction of the
two roads, to seek an omen: He will cast
lots with arrows, he will consult his idols,
he will examine the liver.
22Into his right hand will come the lot for
Jerusalem, where he is to set up
battering rams, to give the command to
slaughter, to sound the battle cry, to set
battering rams against the gates, to
build a ramp and to erect siege works.
23It will seem like a false omen to those
who have sworn allegiance to him, but
he will remind them of their guilt and
take them captive.
24"Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: 'Because you people have
brought to mind your guilt by your open
rebellion, revealing your sins in all that
you do-because you have done this, you
will be taken captive.
25" 'O profane and wicked prince of
Israel, whose day has come, whose
time of punishment has reached its
climax,
26this is what the Sovereign LORD says:
Take off the turban, remove the crown.
It will not be as it was: The lowly will be
exalted and the exalted will be brought
low.
27A ruin! A ruin! I will make it a ruin! It
will not be restored until he comes to
whom it rightfully belongs; to him I will
give it.'
28"And you, son of man, prophesy and
say, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says about the Ammonites and their
insults: " 'A sword, a sword, drawn for
the slaughter, polished to consume and
to flash like lightning!
29Despite false visions concerning you
and lying divinations about you, it will be
laid on the necks of the wicked who are
to be slain, whose day has come, whose
time of punishment has reached its
climax.
30Return the sword to its scabbard. In
the place where you were created, in
the land of your ancestry, I will judge
you.
31I will pour out my wrath upon you and
breathe out my fiery anger against you; I
will hand you over to brutal men, men
skilled in destruction.
32You will be fuel for the fire, your blood
will be shed in your land, you will be
remembered no more; for I the LORD
have spoken.' "
22The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"Son of man, will you judge her? Will
you judge this city of bloodshed? Then
confront her with all her detestable
practices
3and say: 'This is what the Sovereign
LORD says: O city that brings on herself
doom by shedding blood in her midst
and defiles herself by making idols,
4you have become guilty because of the
blood you have shed and have become
defiled by the idols you have made. You
have brought your days to a close, and
the end of your years has come.
Therefore I will make you an object of
scorn to the nations and a laughingstock
to all the countries.
5Those who are near and those who are
far away will mock you, O infamous city,
full of turmoil.
6" 'See how each of the princes of Israel
who are in you uses his power to shed
blood.
7In you they have treated father and
mother with contempt; in you they have
oppressed the alien and mistreated the
fatherless and the widow.
8You have despised my holy things and
desecrated my Sabbaths.
9In you are slanderous men bent on
shedding blood; in you are those who
eat at the mountain shrines and commit
lewd acts.
10In you are those who dishonor their
fathers' bed; in you are those who
violate women during their period, when
they are ceremonially unclean.
11In you one man commits a detestable
offense with his neighbor's wife, another
shamefully defiles his daughter-in-law,
and another violates his sister, his own
father's daughter.
12In you men accept bribes to shed
blood; you take usury and excessive
interest and make unjust gain from your
neighbors by extortion. And you have
forgotten me, declares the Sovereign
LORD .
13" 'I will surely strike my hands together
at the unjust gain you have made and at
the blood you have shed in your midst.
14Will your courage endure or your
hands be strong in the day I deal with
you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will
do it.
15I will disperse you among the nations
and scatter you through the countries;
and I will put an end to your
uncleanness.
16When you have been defiled in the
eyes of the nations, you will know that I
am the LORD .' "
17Then the word of the LORD came to
me:
18"Son of man, the house of Israel has
become dross to me; all of them are the
copper, tin, iron and lead left inside a
furnace. They are but the dross of silver.
19Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: 'Because you have all
become dross, I will gather you into
Jerusalem.
20As men gather silver, copper, iron,
lead and tin into a furnace to melt it with
a fiery blast, so will I gather you in my
anger and my wrath and put you inside
the city and melt you.
21I will gather you and I will blow on you
with my fiery wrath, and you will be
melted inside her.
22As silver is melted in a furnace, so you
will be melted inside her, and you will
know that I the LORD have poured out
my wrath upon you.' "
23Again the word of the LORD came to
me:
24"Son of man, say to the land, 'You are
a land that has had no rain or showers
in the day of wrath.'
25There is a conspiracy of her princes
within her like a roaring lion tearing its
prey; they devour people, take treasures
and precious things and make many
widows within her.
26Her priests do violence to my law and
profane my holy things; they do not
distinguish between the holy and the
common; they teach that there is no
difference between the unclean and the
clean; and they shut their eyes to the
keeping of my Sabbaths, so that I am
profaned among them.
27Her officials within her are like wolves
tearing their prey; they shed blood and
kill people to make unjust gain.
28Her prophets whitewash these deeds
for them by false visions and lying
divinations. They say, 'This is what the
Sovereign LORD says'-when the LORD
has not spoken.
29The people of the land practice
extortion and commit robbery; they
oppress the poor and needy and
mistreat the alien, denying them justice.
30"I looked for a man among them who
would build up the wall and stand before
me in the gap on behalf of the land so I
would not have to destroy it, but I found
none.
31So I will pour out my wrath on them
and consume them with my fiery anger,
bringing down on their own heads all
they have done, declares the Sovereign
LORD ."
23The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"Son of man, there were two women,
daughters of the same mother.
3They became prostitutes in Egypt,
engaging in prostitution from their youth.
In that land their breasts were fondled
and their virgin bosoms caressed.
4The older was named Oholah, and her
sister was Oholibah. They were mine
and gave birth to sons and daughters.
Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is
Jerusalem.
5"Oholah engaged in prostitution while
she was still mine; and she lusted after
her lovers, the Assyrians-warriors
6clothed in blue, governors and
commanders, all of them handsome
young men, and mounted horsemen.
7She gave herself as a prostitute to all
the elite of the Assyrians and defiled
herself with all the idols of everyone she
lusted after.
8She did not give up the prostitution she
began in Egypt, when during her youth
men slept with her, caressed her virgin
bosom and poured out their lust upon
her.
9"Therefore I handed her over to her
lovers, the Assyrians, for whom she
lusted.
10They stripped her naked, took away
her sons and daughters and killed her
with the sword. She became a byword
among women, and punishment was
inflicted on her.
11"Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in
her lust and prostitution she was more
depraved than her sister.
12She too lusted after the Assyriansgovernors
and commanders, warriors in
full dress, mounted horsemen, all
handsome young men.
13I saw that she too defiled herself; both
of them went the same way.
14"But she carried her prostitution still
further. She saw men portrayed on a
wall, figures of Chaldeans portrayed in
red,
15with belts around their waists and
flowing turbans on their heads; all of
them looked like Babylonian chariot
officers, natives of Chaldea.
16As soon as she saw them, she lusted
after them and sent messengers to them
in Chaldea.
17Then the Babylonians came to her, to
the bed of love, and in their lust they
defiled her. After she had been defiled
by them, she turned away from them in
disgust.
18When she carried on her prostitution
openly and exposed her nakedness, I
turned away from her in disgust, just as I
had turned away from her sister.
19Yet she became more and more
promiscuous as she recalled the days of
her youth, when she was a prostitute in
Egypt.
20There she lusted after her lovers,
whose genitals were like those of
donkeys and whose emission was like
that of horses.
21So you longed for the lewdness of
your youth, when in Egypt your bosom
was caressed and your young breasts
fondled.
22"Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the
Sovereign LORD says: I will stir up your
lovers against you, those you turned
away from in disgust, and I will bring
them against you from every side-
23the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans,
the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa,
and all the Assyrians with them,
handsome young men, all of them
governors and commanders, chariot
officers and men of high rank, all
mounted on horses.
24They will come against you with
weapons, chariots and wagons and with
a throng of people; they will take up
positions against you on every side with
large and small shields and with helmets.
I will turn you over to them for
punishment, and they will punish you
according to their standards.
25I will direct my jealous anger against
you, and they will deal with you in fury.
They will cut off your noses and your
ears, and those of you who are left will
fall by the sword. They will take away
your sons and daughters, and those of
you who are left will be consumed by
fire.
26They will also strip you of your clothes
and take your fine jewelry.
27So I will put a stop to the lewdness
and prostitution you began in Egypt.
You will not look on these things with
longing or remember Egypt anymore.
28"For this is what the Sovereign LORD
says: I am about to hand you over to
those you hate, to those you turned
away from in disgust.
29They will deal with you in hatred and
take away everything you have worked
for. They will leave you naked and bare,
and the shame of your prostitution will
be exposed. Your lewdness and
promiscuity
30have brought this upon you, because
you lusted after the nations and defiled
yourself with their idols.
31You have gone the way of your sister;
so I will put her cup into your hand.
32"This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: "You will drink your sister's cup, a
cup large and deep; it will bring scorn
and derision, for it holds so much.
33You will be filled with drunkenness and
sorrow, the cup of ruin and desolation,
the cup of your sister Samaria.
34You will drink it and drain it dry; you
will dash it to pieces and tear your
breasts. I have spoken, declares the
Sovereign LORD .
35"Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: Since you have forgotten
me and thrust me behind your back, you
must bear the consequences of your
lewdness and prostitution."
36The LORD said to me: "Son of man,
will you judge Oholah and Oholibah?
Then confront them with their detestable
practices,
37for they have committed adultery and
blood is on their hands. They committed
adultery with their idols; they even
sacrificed their children, whom they bore
to me, as food for them.
38They have also done this to me: At
that same time they defiled my
sanctuary and desecrated my Sabbaths.
39On the very day they sacrificed their
children to their idols, they entered my
sanctuary and desecrated it. That is
what they did in my house.
40"They even sent messengers for men
who came from far away, and when they
arrived you bathed yourself for them,
painted your eyes and put on your
jewelry.
41You sat on an elegant couch, with a
table spread before it on which you had
placed the incense and oil that belonged
to me.
42"The noise of a carefree crowd was
around her; Sabeans were brought from
the desert along with men from the
rabble, and they put bracelets on the
arms of the woman and her sister and
beautiful crowns on their heads.
43Then I said about the one worn out by
adultery, 'Now let them use her as a
prostitute, for that is all she is.'
44And they slept with her. As men sleep
with a prostitute, so they slept with those
lewd women, Oholah and Oholibah.
45But righteous men will sentence them
to the punishment of women who
commit adultery and shed blood,
because they are adulterous and blood
is on their hands.
46"This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: Bring a mob against them and
give them over to terror and plunder.
47The mob will stone them and cut them
down with their swords; they will kill their
sons and daughters and burn down their
houses.
48"So I will put an end to lewdness in the
land, that all women may take warning
and not imitate you.
49You will suffer the penalty for your
lewdness and bear the consequences of
your sins of idolatry. Then you will know
that I am the Sovereign LORD ."
24In the ninth year, in the tenth
month on the tenth day, the word of the
LORD came to me:
2"Son of man, record this date, this very
date, because the king of Babylon has
laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.
3Tell this rebellious house a parable and
say to them: 'This is what the Sovereign
LORD says: " 'Put on the cooking pot;
put it on and pour water into it.
4Put into it the pieces of meat, all the
choice pieces-the leg and the shoulder.
Fill it with the best of these bones;
5take the pick of the flock. Pile wood
beneath it for the bones; bring it to a boil
and cook the bones in it.
6" 'For this is what the Sovereign LORD
says: " 'Woe to the city of bloodshed, to
the pot now encrusted, whose deposit
will not go away! Empty it piece by piece
without casting lots for them.
7" 'For the blood she shed is in her
midst: She poured it on the bare rock;
she did not pour it on the ground, where
the dust would cover it.
8To stir up wrath and take revenge I put
her blood on the bare rock, so that it
would not be covered.
9" 'Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: " 'Woe to the city of
bloodshed! I, too, will pile the wood high.
10So heap on the wood and kindle the
fire. Cook the meat well, mixing in the
spices; and let the bones be charred.
11Then set the empty pot on the coals till
it becomes hot and its copper glows so
its impurities may be melted and its
deposit burned away.
12It has frustrated all efforts; its heavy
deposit has not been removed, not even
by fire.
13" 'Now your impurity is lewdness.
Because I tried to cleanse you but you
would not be cleansed from your
impurity, you will not be clean again until
my wrath against you has subsided.
14" 'I the LORD have spoken. The time
has come for me to act. I will not hold
back; I will not have pity, nor will I relent.
You will be judged according to your
conduct and your actions, declares the
Sovereign LORD .' "
15The word of the LORD came to me:
16"Son of man, with one blow I am about
to take away from you the delight of
your eyes. Yet do not lament or weep or
shed any tears.
17Groan quietly; do not mourn for the
dead. Keep your turban fastened and
your sandals on your feet; do not cover
the lower part of your face or eat the
customary food of mourners ."
18So I spoke to the people in the
morning, and in the evening my wife
died. The next morning I did as I had
been commanded.
19Then the people asked me, "Won't you
tell us what these things have to do with
us?"
20So I said to them, "The word of the
LORD came to me:
21Say to the house of Israel, 'This is
what the Sovereign LORD says: I am
about to desecrate my sanctuary-the
stronghold in which you take pride, the
delight of your eyes, the object of your
affection. The sons and daughters you
left behind will fall by the sword.
22And you will do as I have done. You
will not cover the lower part of your face
or eat the customary food of mourners .
23You will keep your turbans on your
heads and your sandals on your feet.
You will not mourn or weep but will
waste away because of your sins and
groan among yourselves.
24Ezekiel will be a sign to you; you will
do just as he has done. When this
happens, you will know that I am the
Sovereign LORD .'
25"And you, son of man, on the day I
take away their stronghold, their joy and
glory, the delight of their eyes, their
heart's desire, and their sons and
daughters as well-
26on that day a fugitive will come to tell
you the news.
27At that time your mouth will be
opened; you will speak with him and will
no longer be silent. So you will be a sign
to them, and they will know that I am the
LORD ."
25The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"Son of man, set your face against the
Ammonites and prophesy against them.
3Say to them, 'Hear the word of the
Sovereign LORD . This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: Because you
said "Aha!" over my sanctuary when it
was desecrated and over the land of
Israel when it was laid waste and over
the people of Judah when they went into
exile,
4therefore I am going to give you to the
people of the East as a possession.
They will set up their camps and pitch
their tents among you; they will eat your
fruit and drink your milk.
5I will turn Rabbah into a pasture for
camels and Ammon into a resting place
for sheep. Then you will know that I am
the LORD .
6For this is what the Sovereign LORD
says: Because you have clapped your
hands and stamped your feet, rejoicing
with all the malice of your heart against
the land of Israel,
7therefore I will stretch out my hand
against you and give you as plunder to
the nations. I will cut you off from the
nations and exterminate you from the
countries. I will destroy you, and you will
know that I am the LORD .' "
8"This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: 'Because Moab and Seir said,
"Look, the house of Judah has become
like all the other nations,"
9therefore I will expose the flank of
Moab, beginning at its frontier towns-
Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon and
Kiriathaim-the glory of that land.
10I will give Moab along with the
Ammonites to the people of the East as
a possession, so that the Ammonites
will not be remembered among the
nations;
11and I will inflict punishment on Moab.
Then they will know that I am the
LORD .' "
12"This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: 'Because Edom took revenge on
the house of Judah and became very
guilty by doing so,
13therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: I will stretch out my hand
against Edom and kill its men and their
animals. I will lay it waste, and from
Teman to Dedan they will fall by the
sword.
14I will take vengeance on Edom by the
hand of my people Israel, and they will
deal with Edom in accordance with my
anger and my wrath; they will know my
vengeance, declares the Sovereign
LORD .' "
15"This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: 'Because the Philistines acted in
vengeance and took revenge with
malice in their hearts, and with ancient
hostility sought to destroy Judah,
16therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: I am about to stretch out
my hand against the Philistines, and I
will cut off the Kerethites and destroy
those remaining along the coast.
17I will carry out great vengeance on
them and punish them in my wrath.
Then they will know that I am the LORD ,
when I take vengeance on them.' "
26In the eleventh year, on the first
day of the month, the word of the LORD
came to me:
2"Son of man, because Tyre has said of
Jerusalem, 'Aha! The gate to the nations
is broken, and its doors have swung
open to me; now that she lies in ruins I
will prosper,'
3therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: I am against you, O Tyre,
and I will bring many nations against
you, like the sea casting up its waves.
4They will destroy the walls of Tyre and
pull down her towers; I will scrape away
her rubble and make her a bare rock.
5Out in the sea she will become a place
to spread fishnets, for I have spoken,
declares the Sovereign LORD . She will
become plunder for the nations,
6and her settlements on the mainland
will be ravaged by the sword. Then they
will know that I am the LORD .
7"For this is what the Sovereign LORD
says: From the north I am going to bring
against Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon, king of kings, with horses and
chariots, with horsemen and a great
army.
8He will ravage your settlements on the
mainland with the sword; he will set up
siege works against you, build a ramp
up to your walls and raise his shields
against you.
9He will direct the blows of his battering
rams against your walls and demolish
your towers with his weapons.
10His horses will be so many that they
will cover you with dust. Your walls will
tremble at the noise of the war horses,
wagons and chariots when he enters
your gates as men enter a city whose
walls have been broken through.
11The hoofs of his horses will trample all
your streets; he will kill your people with
the sword, and your strong pillars will fall
to the ground.
12They will plunder your wealth and loot
your merchandise; they will break down
your walls and demolish your fine
houses and throw your stones, timber
and rubble into the sea.
13I will put an end to your noisy songs,
and the music of your harps will be
heard no more.
14I will make you a bare rock, and you
will become a place to spread fishnets.
You will never be rebuilt, for I the LORD
have spoken, declares the Sovereign
LORD .
15"This is what the Sovereign LORD
says to Tyre: Will not the coastlands
tremble at the sound of your fall, when
the wounded groan and the slaughter
takes place in you?
16Then all the princes of the coast will
step down from their thrones and lay
aside their robes and take off their
embroidered garments. Clothed with
terror, they will sit on the ground,
trembling every moment, appalled at
you.
17Then they will take up a lament
concerning you and say to you: " 'How
you are destroyed, O city of renown,
peopled by men of the sea! You were a
power on the seas, you and your
citizens; you put your terror on all who
lived there.
18Now the coastlands tremble on the
day of your fall; the islands in the sea
are terrified at your collapse.'
19"This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: When I make you a desolate city,
like cities no longer inhabited, and when
I bring the ocean depths over you and
its vast waters cover you,
20then I will bring you down with those
who go down to the pit, to the people of
long ago. I will make you dwell in the
earth below, as in ancient ruins, with
those who go down to the pit, and you
will not return or take your place in the
land of the living.
21I will bring you to a horrible end and
you will be no more. You will be sought,
but you will never again be found,
declares the Sovereign LORD ."
27The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"Son of man, take up a lament
concerning Tyre.
3Say to Tyre, situated at the gateway to
the sea, merchant of peoples on many
coasts, 'This is what the Sovereign
LORD says: " 'You say, O Tyre, "I am
perfect in beauty."
4Your domain was on the high seas;
your builders brought your beauty to
perfection.
5They made all your timbers of pine
trees from Senir ; they took a cedar from
Lebanon to make a mast for you.
6Of oaks from Bashan they made your
oars; of cypress wood from the coasts of
Cyprus they made your deck, inlaid with
ivory.
7Fine embroidered linen from Egypt was
your sail and served as your banner;
your awnings were of blue and purple
from the coasts of Elishah.
8Men of Sidon and Arvad were your
oarsmen; your skilled men, O Tyre,
were aboard as your seamen.
9Veteran craftsmen of Gebal were on
board as shipwrights to caulk your
seams. All the ships of the sea and their
sailors came alongside to trade for your
wares.
10" 'Men of Persia, Lydia and Put served
as soldiers in your army. They hung
their shields and helmets on your walls,
bringing you splendor.
11Men of Arvad and Helech manned
your walls on every side; men of
Gammad were in your towers. They
hung their shields around your walls;
they brought your beauty to perfection.
12" 'Tarshish did business with you
because of your great wealth of goods;
they exchanged silver, iron, tin and lead
for your merchandise.
13" 'Greece, Tubal and Meshech traded
with you; they exchanged slaves and
articles of bronze for your wares.
14" 'Men of Beth Togarmah exchanged
work horses, war horses and mules for
your merchandise.
15" 'The men of Rhodes traded with you,
and many coastlands were your
customers; they paid you with ivory
tusks and ebony.
16" 'Aram did business with you because
of your many products; they exchanged
turquoise, purple fabric, embroidered
work, fine linen, coral and rubies for
your merchandise.
17" 'Judah and Israel traded with you;
they exchanged wheat from Minnith and
confections, honey, oil and balm for your
wares.
18" 'Damascus, because of your many
products and great wealth of goods, did
business with you in wine from Helbon
and wool from Zahar.
19" 'Danites and Greeks from Uzal
bought your merchandise; they
exchanged wrought iron, cassia and
calamus for your wares.
20" 'Dedan traded in saddle blankets with
you.
21" 'Arabia and all the princes of Kedar
were your customers; they did business
with you in lambs, rams and goats.
22" 'The merchants of Sheba and
Raamah traded with you; for your
merchandise they exchanged the finest
of all kinds of spices and precious
stones, and gold.
23" 'Haran, Canneh and Eden and
merchants of Sheba, Asshur and Kilmad
traded with you.
24In your marketplace they traded with
you beautiful garments, blue fabric,
embroidered work and multicolored rugs
with cords twisted and tightly knotted.
25" 'The ships of Tarshish serve as
carriers for your wares. You are filled
with heavy cargo in the heart of the sea.
26Your oarsmen take you out to the high
seas. But the east wind will break you to
pieces in the heart of the sea.
27Your wealth, merchandise and wares,
your mariners, seamen and shipwrights,
your merchants and all your soldiers,
and everyone else on board will sink
into the heart of the sea on the day of
your shipwreck.
28The shorelands will quake when your
seamen cry out.
29All who handle the oars will abandon
their ships; the mariners and all the
seamen will stand on the shore.
30They will raise their voice and cry
bitterly over you; they will sprinkle dust
on their heads and roll in ashes.
31They will shave their heads because of
you and will put on sackcloth. They will
weep over you with anguish of soul and
with bitter mourning.
32As they wail and mourn over you, they
will take up a lament concerning you:
"Who was ever silenced like Tyre,
surrounded by the sea?"
33When your merchandise went out on
the seas, you satisfied many nations;
with your great wealth and your wares
you enriched the kings of the earth.
34Now you are shattered by the sea in
the depths of the waters; your wares
and all your company have gone down
with you.
35All who live in the coastlands are
appalled at you; their kings shudder with
horror and their faces are distorted with
fear.
36The merchants among the nations hiss
at you; you have come to a horrible end
and will be no more.' "
28The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre,
'This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
" 'In the pride of your heart you say, "I
am a god; I sit on the throne of a god in
the heart of the seas." But you are a
man and not a god, though you think
you are as wise as a god.
3Are you wiser than Daniel ? Is no
secret hidden from you?
4By your wisdom and understanding you
have gained wealth for yourself and
amassed gold and silver in your
treasuries.
5By your great skill in trading you have
increased your wealth, and because of
your wealth your heart has grown proud.
6" 'Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: " 'Because you think you
are wise, as wise as a god,
7I am going to bring foreigners against
you, the most ruthless of nations; they
will draw their swords against your
beauty and wisdom and pierce your
shining splendor.
8They will bring you down to the pit, and
you will die a violent death in the heart
of the seas.
9Will you then say, "I am a god," in the
presence of those who kill you? You will
be but a man, not a god, in the hands of
those who slay you.
10You will die the death of the
uncircumcised at the hands of
foreigners. I have spoken, declares the
Sovereign LORD .' "
11The word of the LORD came to me:
12"Son of man, take up a lament
concerning the king of Tyre and say to
him: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: " 'You were the model of
perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in
beauty.
13You were in Eden, the garden of God;
every precious stone adorned you: ruby,
topaz and emerald, chrysolite, onyx and
jasper, sapphire, turquoise and beryl.
Your settings and mountings were made
of gold; on the day you were created
they were prepared.
14You were anointed as a guardian
cherub, for so I ordained you. You were
on the holy mount of God; you walked
among the fiery stones.
15You were blameless in your ways from
the day you were created till wickedness
was found in you.
16Through your widespread trade you
were filled with violence, and you sinned.
So I drove you in disgrace from the
mount of God, and I expelled you, O
guardian cherub, from among the fiery
stones.
17Your heart became proud on account
of your beauty, and you corrupted your
wisdom because of your splendor. So I
threw you to the earth; I made a
spectacle of you before kings.
18By your many sins and dishonest trade
you have desecrated your sanctuaries.
So I made a fire come out from you, and
it consumed you, and I reduced you to
ashes on the ground in the sight of all
who were watching.
19All the nations who knew you are
appalled at you; you have come to a
horrible end and will be no more.' "
20The word of the LORD came to me:
21"Son of man, set your face against
Sidon; prophesy against her
22and say: 'This is what the Sovereign
LORD says: " 'I am against you, O Sidon,
and I will gain glory within you. They will
know that I am the LORD , when I inflict
punishment on her and show myself
holy within her.
23I will send a plague upon her and
make blood flow in her streets. The slain
will fall within her, with the sword against
her on every side. Then they will know
that I am the LORD .
24" 'No longer will the people of Israel
have malicious neighbors who are
painful briers and sharp thorns. Then
they will know that I am the Sovereign
LORD .
25" 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: When I gather the people of Israel
from the nations where they have been
scattered, I will show myself holy among
them in the sight of the nations. Then
they will live in their own land, which I
gave to my servant Jacob.
26They will live there in safety and will
build houses and plant vineyards; they
will live in safety when I inflict
punishment on all their neighbors who
maligned them. Then they will know that
I am the LORD their God.' "
29In the tenth year, in the tenth
month on the twelfth day, the word of
the LORD came to me:
2"Son of man, set your face against
Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy
against him and against all Egypt.
3Speak to him and say: 'This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: " 'I am against
you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, you great
monster lying among your streams. You
say, "The Nile is mine; I made it for
myself."
4But I will put hooks in your jaws and
make the fish of your streams stick to
your scales. I will pull you out from
among your streams, with all the fish
sticking to your scales.
5I will leave you in the desert, you and
all the fish of your streams. You will fall
on the open field and not be gathered or
picked up. I will give you as food to the
beasts of the earth and the birds of the
air.
6Then all who live in Egypt will know that
I am the LORD . " 'You have been a
staff of reed for the house of Israel.
7When they grasped you with their
hands, you splintered and you tore open
their shoulders; when they leaned on
you, you broke and their backs were
wrenched.
8" 'Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: I will bring a sword against
you and kill your men and their animals.
9Egypt will become a desolate
wasteland. Then they will know that I am
the LORD . " 'Because you said, "The
Nile is mine; I made it,"
10therefore I am against you and against
your streams, and I will make the land of
Egypt a ruin and a desolate waste from
Migdol to Aswan, as far as the border of
Cush.
11No foot of man or animal will pass
through it; no one will live there for forty
years.
12I will make the land of Egypt desolate
among devastated lands, and her cities
will lie desolate forty years among
ruined cities. And I will disperse the
Egyptians among the nations and
scatter them through the countries.
13" 'Yet this is what the Sovereign LORD
says: At the end of forty years I will
gather the Egyptians from the nations
where they were scattered.
14I will bring them back from captivity
and return them to Upper Egypt, the
land of their ancestry. There they will be
a lowly kingdom.
15It will be the lowliest of kingdoms and
will never again exalt itself above the
other nations. I will make it so weak that
it will never again rule over the nations.
16Egypt will no longer be a source of
confidence for the people of Israel but
will be a reminder of their sin in turning
to her for help. Then they will know that I
am the Sovereign LORD .' "
17In the twenty-seventh year, in the first
month on the first day, the word of the
LORD came to me:
18"Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon drove his army in a hard
campaign against Tyre; every head was
rubbed bare and every shoulder made
raw. Yet he and his army got no reward
from the campaign he led against Tyre.
19Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: I am going to give Egypt to
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and
he will carry off its wealth. He will loot
and plunder the land as pay for his army.
20I have given him Egypt as a reward for
his efforts because he and his army did
it for me, declares the Sovereign LORD .
21"On that day I will make a horn grow
for the house of Israel, and I will open
your mouth among them. Then they will
know that I am the LORD ."
30The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"Son of man, prophesy and say: 'This is
what the Sovereign LORD says: " 'Wail
and say, "Alas for that day!"
3For the day is near, the day of the
LORD is near- a day of clouds, a time of
doom for the nations.
4A sword will come against Egypt, and
anguish will come upon Cush. When the
slain fall in Egypt, her wealth will be
carried away and her foundations torn
down.
5Cush and Put, Lydia and all Arabia,
Libya and the people of the covenant
land will fall by the sword along with
Egypt.
6" 'This is what the LORD says: " 'The
allies of Egypt will fall and her proud
strength will fail. From Migdol to Aswan
they will fall by the sword within her,
declares the Sovereign LORD .
7" 'They will be desolate among desolate
lands, and their cities will lie among
ruined cities.
8Then they will know that I am the
LORD , when I set fire to Egypt and all
her helpers are crushed.
9" 'On that day messengers will go out
from me in ships to frighten Cush out of
her complacency. Anguish will take hold
of them on the day of Egypt's doom, for
it is sure to come.
10" 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: " 'I will put an end to the hordes of
Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon.
11He and his army-the most ruthless of
nations- will be brought in to destroy the
land. They will draw their swords against
Egypt and fill the land with the slain.
12I will dry up the streams of the Nile and
sell the land to evil men; by the hand of
foreigners I will lay waste the land and
everything in it. I the LORD have spoken.
13" 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: " 'I will destroy the idols and put an
end to the images in Memphis. No
longer will there be a prince in Egypt,
and I will spread fear throughout the
land.
14I will lay waste Upper Egypt, set fire to
Zoan and inflict punishment on Thebes.
15I will pour out my wrath on Pelusium,
the stronghold of Egypt, and cut off the
hordes of Thebes.
16I will set fire to Egypt; Pelusium will
writhe in agony. Thebes will be taken by
storm; Memphis will be in constant
distress.
17The young men of Heliopolis and
Bubastis will fall by the sword, and the
cities themselves will go into captivity.
18Dark will be the day at Tahpanhes
when I break the yoke of Egypt; there
her proud strength will come to an end.
She will be covered with clouds, and her
villages will go into captivity.
19So I will inflict punishment on Egypt,
and they will know that I am the LORD .'
"
20In the eleventh year, in the first month
on the seventh day, the word of the
LORD came to me:
21"Son of man, I have broken the arm of
Pharaoh king of Egypt. It has not been
bound up for healing or put in a splint so
as to become strong enough to hold a
sword.
22Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: I am against Pharaoh king
of Egypt. I will break both his arms, the
good arm as well as the broken one,
and make the sword fall from his hand.
23I will disperse the Egyptians among
the nations and scatter them through the
countries.
24I will strengthen the arms of the king of
Babylon and put my sword in his hand,
but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and
he will groan before him like a mortally
wounded man.
25I will strengthen the arms of the king of
Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh will
fall limp. Then they will know that I am
the LORD , when I put my sword into
the hand of the king of Babylon and he
brandishes it against Egypt.
26I will disperse the Egyptians among
the nations and scatter them through the
countries. Then they will know that I am
the LORD ."
31In the eleventh year, in the third
month on the first day, the word of the
LORD came to me:
2"Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of
Egypt and to his hordes: " 'Who can be
compared with you in majesty?
3Consider Assyria, once a cedar in
Lebanon, with beautiful branches
overshadowing the forest; it towered on
high, its top above the thick foliage.
4The waters nourished it, deep springs
made it grow tall; their streams flowed
all around its base and sent their
channels to all the trees of the field.
5So it towered higher than all the trees
of the field; its boughs increased and its
branches grew long, spreading because
of abundant waters.
6All the birds of the air nested in its
boughs, all the beasts of the field gave
birth under its branches; all the great
nations lived in its shade.
7It was majestic in beauty, with its
spreading boughs, for its roots went
down to abundant waters.
8The cedars in the garden of God could
not rival it, nor could the pine trees
equal its boughs, nor could the plane
trees compare with its branches- no tree
in the garden of God could match its
beauty.
9I made it beautiful with abundant
branches, the envy of all the trees of
Eden in the garden of God.
10" 'Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: Because it towered on high,
lifting its top above the thick foliage, and
because it was proud of its height,
11I handed it over to the ruler of the
nations, for him to deal with according to
its wickedness. I cast it aside,
12and the most ruthless of foreign
nations cut it down and left it. Its boughs
fell on the mountains and in all the
valleys; its branches lay broken in all the
ravines of the land. All the nations of the
earth came out from under its shade
and left it.
13All the birds of the air settled on the
fallen tree, and all the beasts of the field
were among its branches.
14Therefore no other trees by the waters
are ever to tower proudly on high, lifting
their tops above the thick foliage. No
other trees so well-watered are ever to
reach such a height; they are all
destined for death, for the earth below,
among mortal men, with those who go
down to the pit.
15" 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: On the day it was brought down to
the grave I covered the deep springs
with mourning for it; I held back its
streams, and its abundant waters were
restrained. Because of it I clothed
Lebanon with gloom, and all the trees of
the field withered away.
16I made the nations tremble at the
sound of its fall when I brought it down
to the grave with those who go down to
the pit. Then all the trees of Eden, the
choicest and best of Lebanon, all the
trees that were well-watered, were
consoled in the earth below.
17Those who lived in its shade, its allies
among the nations, had also gone down
to the grave with it, joining those killed
by the sword.
18" 'Which of the trees of Eden can be
compared with you in splendor and
majesty? Yet you, too, will be brought
down with the trees of Eden to the earth
below; you will lie among the
uncircumcised, with those killed by the
sword. " 'This is Pharaoh and all his
hordes, declares the Sovereign LORD .'
"
32In the twelfth year, in the twelfth
month on the first day, the word of the
LORD came to me:
2"Son of man, take up a lament
concerning Pharaoh king of Egypt and
say to him: " 'You are like a lion among
the nations; you are like a monster in
the seas thrashing about in your
streams, churning the water with your
feet and muddying the streams.
3" 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: " 'With a great throng of people I
will cast my net over you, and they will
haul you up in my net.
4I will throw you on the land and hurl you
on the open field. I will let all the birds of
the air settle on you and all the beasts of
the earth gorge themselves on you.
5I will spread your flesh on the
mountains and fill the valleys with your
remains.
6I will drench the land with your flowing
blood all the way to the mountains, and
the ravines will be filled with your flesh.
7When I snuff you out, I will cover the
heavens and darken their stars; I will
cover the sun with a cloud, and the
moon will not give its light.
8All the shining lights in the heavens I
will darken over you; I will bring
darkness over your land, declares the
Sovereign LORD .
9I will trouble the hearts of many peoples
when I bring about your destruction
among the nations, among lands you
have not known.
10I will cause many peoples to be
appalled at you, and their kings will
shudder with horror because of you
when I brandish my sword before them.
On the day of your downfall each of
them will tremble every moment for his
life.
11" 'For this is what the Sovereign LORD
says: " 'The sword of the king of Babylon
will come against you.
12I will cause your hordes to fall by the
swords of mighty men- the most ruthless
of all nations. They will shatter the pride
of Egypt, and all her hordes will be
overthrown.
13I will destroy all her cattle from beside
abundant waters no longer to be stirred
by the foot of man or muddied by the
hoofs of cattle.
14Then I will let her waters settle and
make her streams flow like oil, declares
the Sovereign LORD .
15When I make Egypt desolate and strip
the land of everything in it, when I strike
down all who live there, then they will
know that I am the LORD .'
16"This is the lament they will chant for
her. The daughters of the nations will
chant it; for Egypt and all her hordes
they will chant it, declares the Sovereign
LORD ."
17In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day
of the month, the word of the LORD
came to me:
18"Son of man, wail for the hordes of
Egypt and consign to the earth below
both her and the daughters of mighty
nations, with those who go down to the
pit.
19Say to them, 'Are you more favored
than others? Go down and be laid
among the uncircumcised.'
20They will fall among those killed by the
sword. The sword is drawn; let her be
dragged off with all her hordes.
21From within the grave the mighty
leaders will say of Egypt and her allies,
'They have come down and they lie with
the uncircumcised, with those killed by
the sword.'
22"Assyria is there with her whole army;
she is surrounded by the graves of all
her slain, all who have fallen by the
sword.
23Their graves are in the depths of the
pit and her army lies around her grave.
All who had spread terror in the land of
the living are slain, fallen by the sword.
24"Elam is there, with all her hordes
around her grave. All of them are slain,
fallen by the sword. All who had spread
terror in the land of the living went down
uncircumcised to the earth below. They
bear their shame with those who go
down to the pit.
25A bed is made for her among the slain,
with all her hordes around her grave. All
of them are uncircumcised, killed by the
sword. Because their terror had spread
in the land of the living, they bear their
shame with those who go down to the
pit; they are laid among the slain.
26"Meshech and Tubal are there, with all
their hordes around their graves. All of
them are uncircumcised, killed by the
sword because they spread their terror
in the land of the living.
27Do they not lie with the other
uncircumcised warriors who have fallen,
who went down to the grave with their
weapons of war, whose swords were
placed under their heads? The
punishment for their sins rested on their
bones, though the terror of these
warriors had stalked through the land of
the living.
28"You too, O Pharaoh, will be broken
and will lie among the uncircumcised,
with those killed by the sword.
29"Edom is there, her kings and all her
princes; despite their power, they are
laid with those killed by the sword. They
lie with the uncircumcised, with those
who go down to the pit.
30"All the princes of the north and all the
Sidonians are there; they went down
with the slain in disgrace despite the
terror caused by their power. They lie
uncircumcised with those killed by the
sword and bear their shame with those
who go down to the pit.
31"Pharaoh-he and all his army-will see
them and he will be consoled for all his
hordes that were killed by the sword,
declares the Sovereign LORD .
32Although I had him spread terror in the
land of the living, Pharaoh and all his
hordes will be laid among the
uncircumcised, with those killed by the
sword, declares the Sovereign LORD ."
33The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"Son of man, speak to your countrymen
and say to them: 'When I bring the
sword against a land, and the people of
the land choose one of their men and
make him their watchman,
3and he sees the sword coming against
the land and blows the trumpet to warn
the people,
4then if anyone hears the trumpet but
does not take warning and the sword
comes and takes his life, his blood will
be on his own head.
5Since he heard the sound of the
trumpet but did not take warning, his
blood will be on his own head. If he had
taken warning, he would have saved
himself.
6But if the watchman sees the sword
coming and does not blow the trumpet
to warn the people and the sword
comes and takes the life of one of them,
that man will be taken away because of
his sin, but I will hold the watchman
accountable for his blood.'
7"Son of man, I have made you a
watchman for the house of Israel; so
hear the word I speak and give them
warning from me.
8When I say to the wicked, 'O wicked
man, you will surely die,' and you do not
speak out to dissuade him from his
ways, that wicked man will die for his sin,
and I will hold you accountable for his
blood.
9But if you do warn the wicked man to
turn from his ways and he does not do
so, he will die for his sin, but you will
have saved yourself.
10"Son of man, say to the house of Israel,
'This is what you are saying: "Our
offenses and sins weigh us down, and
we are wasting away because of them.
How then can we live?" '
11Say to them, 'As surely as I live,
declares the Sovereign LORD , I take no
pleasure in the death of the wicked, but
rather that they turn from their ways and
live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways!
Why will you die, O house of Israel?'
12"Therefore, son of man, say to your
countrymen, 'The righteousness of the
righteous man will not save him when
he disobeys, and the wickedness of the
wicked man will not cause him to fall
when he turns from it. The righteous
man, if he sins, will not be allowed to
live because of his former
righteousness.'
13If I tell the righteous man that he will
surely live, but then he trusts in his
righteousness and does evil, none of the
righteous things he has done will be
remembered; he will die for the evil he
has done.
14And if I say to the wicked man, 'You
will surely die,' but he then turns away
from his sin and does what is just and
right-
15if he gives back what he took in pledge
for a loan, returns what he has stolen,
follows the decrees that give life, and
does no evil, he will surely live; he will
not die.
16None of the sins he has committed will
be remembered against him. He has
done what is just and right; he will surely
live.
17"Yet your countrymen say, 'The way of
the Lord is not just.' But it is their way
that is not just.
18If a righteous man turns from his
righteousness and does evil, he will die
for it.
19And if a wicked man turns away from
his wickedness and does what is just
and right, he will live by doing so.
20Yet, O house of Israel, you say, 'The
way of the Lord is not just.' But I will
judge each of you according to his own
ways."
21In the twelfth year of our exile, in the
tenth month on the fifth day, a man who
had escaped from Jerusalem came to
me and said, "The city has fallen!"
22Now the evening before the man
arrived, the hand of the LORD was upon
me, and he opened my mouth before
the man came to me in the morning. So
my mouth was opened and I was no
longer silent.
23Then the word of the LORD came to
me:
24"Son of man, the people living in those
ruins in the land of Israel are saying,
'Abraham was only one man, yet he
possessed the land. But we are many;
surely the land has been given to us as
our possession.'
25Therefore say to them, 'This is what
the Sovereign LORD says: Since you
eat meat with the blood still in it and look
to your idols and shed blood, should you
then possess the land?
26You rely on your sword, you do
detestable things, and each of you
defiles his neighbor's wife. Should you
then possess the land?'
27"Say this to them: 'This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: As surely as I
live, those who are left in the ruins will
fall by the sword, those out in the
country I will give to the wild animals to
be devoured, and those in strongholds
and caves will die of a plague.
28I will make the land a desolate waste,
and her proud strength will come to an
end, and the mountains of Israel will
become desolate so that no one will
cross them.
29Then they will know that I am the
LORD , when I have made the land a
desolate waste because of all the
detestable things they have done.'
30"As for you, son of man, your
countrymen are talking together about
you by the walls and at the doors of the
houses, saying to each other, 'Come
and hear the message that has come
from the LORD .'
31My people come to you, as they
usually do, and sit before you to listen to
your words, but they do not put them
into practice. With their mouths they
express devotion, but their hearts are
greedy for unjust gain.
32Indeed, to them you are nothing more
than one who sings love songs with a
beautiful voice and plays an instrument
well, for they hear your words but do not
put them into practice.
33"When all this comes true-and it surely
will-then they will know that a prophet
has been among them."
34The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"Son of man, prophesy against the
shepherds of Israel; prophesy and say
to them: 'This is what the Sovereign
LORD says: Woe to the shepherds of
Israel who only take care of themselves!
Should not shepherds take care of the
flock?
3You eat the curds, clothe yourselves
with the wool and slaughter the choice
animals, but you do not take care of the
flock.
4You have not strengthened the weak or
healed the sick or bound up the injured.
You have not brought back the strays or
searched for the lost. You have ruled
them harshly and brutally.
5So they were scattered because there
was no shepherd, and when they were
scattered they became food for all the
wild animals.
6My sheep wandered over all the
mountains and on every high hill. They
were scattered over the whole earth,
and no one searched or looked for them.
7" 'Therefore, you shepherds, hear the
word of the LORD :
8As surely as I live, declares the
Sovereign LORD , because my flock
lacks a shepherd and so has been
plundered and has become food for all
the wild animals, and because my
shepherds did not search for my flock
but cared for themselves rather than for
my flock,
9therefore, O shepherds, hear the word
of the LORD :
10This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: I am against the shepherds and
will hold them accountable for my flock. I
will remove them from tending the flock
so that the shepherds can no longer
feed themselves. I will rescue my flock
from their mouths, and it will no longer
be food for them.
11" 'For this is what the Sovereign LORD
says: I myself will search for my sheep
and look after them.
12As a shepherd looks after his
scattered flock when he is with them, so
will I look after my sheep. I will rescue
them from all the places where they
were scattered on a day of clouds and
darkness.
13I will bring them out from the nations
and gather them from the countries, and
I will bring them into their own land. I will
pasture them on the mountains of Israel,
in the ravines and in all the settlements
in the land.
14I will tend them in a good pasture, and
the mountain heights of Israel will be
their grazing land. There they will lie
down in good grazing land, and there
they will feed in a rich pasture on the
mountains of Israel.
15I myself will tend my sheep and have
them lie down, declares the Sovereign
LORD .
16I will search for the lost and bring back
the strays. I will bind up the injured and
strengthen the weak, but the sleek and
the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd
the flock with justice.
17" 'As for you, my flock, this is what the
Sovereign LORD says: I will judge
between one sheep and another, and
between rams and goats.
18Is it not enough for you to feed on the
good pasture? Must you also trample
the rest of your pasture with your feet?
Is it not enough for you to drink clear
water? Must you also muddy the rest
with your feet?
19Must my flock feed on what you have
trampled and drink what you have
muddied with your feet?
20" 'Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says to them: See, I myself will
judge between the fat sheep and the
lean sheep.
21Because you shove with flank and
shoulder, butting all the weak sheep
with your horns until you have driven
them away,
22I will save my flock, and they will no
longer be plundered. I will judge
between one sheep and another.
23I will place over them one shepherd,
my servant David, and he will tend
them; he will tend them and be their
shepherd.
24I the LORD will be their God, and my
servant David will be prince among
them. I the LORD have spoken.
25" 'I will make a covenant of peace with
them and rid the land of wild beasts so
that they may live in the desert and
sleep in the forests in safety.
26I will bless them and the places
surrounding my hill. I will send down
showers in season; there will be
showers of blessing.
27The trees of the field will yield their
fruit and the ground will yield its crops;
the people will be secure in their land.
They will know that I am the LORD ,
when I break the bars of their yoke and
rescue them from the hands of those
who enslaved them.
28They will no longer be plundered by
the nations, nor will wild animals devour
them. They will live in safety, and no
one will make them afraid.
29I will provide for them a land renowned
for its crops, and they will no longer be
victims of famine in the land or bear the
scorn of the nations.
30Then they will know that I, the LORD
their God, am with them and that they,
the house of Israel, are my people,
declares the Sovereign LORD .
31You my sheep, the sheep of my
pasture, are people, and I am your God,
declares the Sovereign LORD .' "
35The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"Son of man, set your face against
Mount Seir; prophesy against it
3and say: 'This is what the Sovereign
LORD says: I am against you, Mount
Seir, and I will stretch out my hand
against you and make you a desolate
waste.
4I will turn your towns into ruins and you
will be desolate. Then you will know that
I am the LORD .
5" 'Because you harbored an ancient
hostility and delivered the Israelites over
to the sword at the time of their calamity,
the time their punishment reached its
climax,
6therefore as surely as I live, declares
the Sovereign LORD , I will give you
over to bloodshed and it will pursue you.
Since you did not hate bloodshed,
bloodshed will pursue you.
7I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste
and cut off from it all who come and go.
8I will fill your mountains with the slain;
those killed by the sword will fall on your
hills and in your valleys and in all your
ravines.
9I will make you desolate forever; your
towns will not be inhabited. Then you
will know that I am the LORD .
10" 'Because you have said, "These two
nations and countries will be ours and
we will take possession of them," even
though I the LORD was there,
11therefore as surely as I live, declares
the Sovereign LORD , I will treat you in
accordance with the anger and jealousy
you showed in your hatred of them and I
will make myself known among them
when I judge you.
12Then you will know that I the LORD
have heard all the contemptible things
you have said against the mountains of
Israel. You said, "They have been laid
waste and have been given over to us to
devour."
13You boasted against me and spoke
against me without restraint, and I heard
it.
14This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: While the whole earth rejoices, I
will make you desolate.
15Because you rejoiced when the
inheritance of the house of Israel
became desolate, that is how I will treat
you. You will be desolate, O Mount Seir,
you and all of Edom. Then they will
know that I am the LORD .' "
36"Son of man, prophesy to the
mountains of Israel and say, 'O
mountains of Israel, hear the word of the
LORD .
2This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
The enemy said of you, "Aha! The
ancient heights have become our
possession." '
3Therefore prophesy and say, 'This is
what the Sovereign LORD says:
Because they ravaged and hounded you
from every side so that you became the
possession of the rest of the nations and
the object of people's malicious talk and
slander,
4therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear
the word of the Sovereign LORD : This
is what the Sovereign LORD says to the
mountains and hills, to the ravines and
valleys, to the desolate ruins and the
deserted towns that have been
plundered and ridiculed by the rest of
the nations around you-
5this is what the Sovereign LORD says:
In my burning zeal I have spoken
against the rest of the nations, and
against all Edom, for with glee and with
malice in their hearts they made my land
their own possession so that they might
plunder its pastureland.'
6Therefore prophesy concerning the
land of Israel and say to the mountains
and hills, to the ravines and valleys:
'This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
I speak in my jealous wrath because
you have suffered the scorn of the
nations.
7Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: I swear with uplifted hand
that the nations around you will also
suffer scorn.
8" 'But you, O mountains of Israel, will
produce branches and fruit for my
people Israel, for they will soon come
home.
9I am concerned for you and will look on
you with favor; you will be plowed and
sown,
10and I will multiply the number of
people upon you, even the whole house
of Israel. The towns will be inhabited
and the ruins rebuilt.
11I will increase the number of men and
animals upon you, and they will be
fruitful and become numerous. I will
settle people on you as in the past and
will make you prosper more than before.
Then you will know that I am the LORD .
12I will cause people, my people Israel,
to walk upon you. They will possess you,
and you will be their inheritance; you will
never again deprive them of their
children.
13" 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: Because people say to you, "You
devour men and deprive your nation of
its children,"
14therefore you will no longer devour
men or make your nation childless,
declares the Sovereign LORD .
15No longer will I make you hear the
taunts of the nations, and no longer will
you suffer the scorn of the peoples or
cause your nation to fall, declares the
Sovereign LORD .' "
16Again the word of the LORD came to
me:
17"Son of man, when the people of Israel
were living in their own land, they defiled
it by their conduct and their actions.
Their conduct was like a woman's
monthly uncleanness in my sight.
18So I poured out my wrath on them
because they had shed blood in the land
and because they had defiled it with
their idols.
19I dispersed them among the nations,
and they were scattered through the
countries; I judged them according to
their conduct and their actions.
20And wherever they went among the
nations they profaned my holy name, for
it was said of them, 'These are the
LORD 's people, and yet they had to
leave his land.'
21I had concern for my holy name, which
the house of Israel profaned among the
nations where they had gone.
22"Therefore say to the house of Israel,
'This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
It is not for your sake, O house of Israel,
that I am going to do these things, but
for the sake of my holy name, which you
have profaned among the nations where
you have gone.
23I will show the holiness of my great
name, which has been profaned among
the nations, the name you have
profaned among them. Then the nations
will know that I am the LORD , declares
the Sovereign LORD , when I show
myself holy through you before their
eyes.
24" 'For I will take you out of the nations;
I will gather you from all the countries
and bring you back into your own land.
25I will sprinkle clean water on you, and
you will be clean; I will cleanse you from
all your impurities and from all your idols.
26I will give you a new heart and put a
new spirit in you; I will remove from you
your heart of stone and give you a heart
of flesh.
27And I will put my Spirit in you and
move you to follow my decrees and be
careful to keep my laws.
28You will live in the land I gave your
forefathers; you will be my people, and I
will be your God.
29I will save you from all your
uncleanness. I will call for the grain and
make it plentiful and will not bring
famine upon you.
30I will increase the fruit of the trees and
the crops of the field, so that you will no
longer suffer disgrace among the
nations because of famine.
31Then you will remember your evil ways
and wicked deeds, and you will loathe
yourselves for your sins and detestable
practices.
32I want you to know that I am not doing
this for your sake, declares the
Sovereign LORD . Be ashamed and
disgraced for your conduct, O house of
Israel!
33" 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: On the day I cleanse you from all
your sins, I will resettle your towns, and
the ruins will be rebuilt.
34The desolate land will be cultivated
instead of lying desolate in the sight of
all who pass through it.
35They will say, "This land that was laid
waste has become like the garden of
Eden; the cities that were lying in ruins,
desolate and destroyed, are now
fortified and inhabited."
36Then the nations around you that
remain will know that I the LORD have
rebuilt what was destroyed and have
replanted what was desolate. I the
LORD have spoken, and I will do it.'
37"This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: Once again I will yield to the plea
of the house of Israel and do this for
them: I will make their people as
numerous as sheep,
38as numerous as the flocks for offerings
at Jerusalem during her appointed
feasts. So will the ruined cities be filled
with flocks of people. Then they will
know that I am the LORD ."
37The hand of the LORD was upon
me, and he brought me out by the Spirit
of the LORD and set me in the middle of
a valley; it was full of bones.
2He led me back and forth among them,
and I saw a great many bones on the
floor of the valley, bones that were very
dry.
3He asked me, "Son of man, can these
bones live?" I said, "O Sovereign LORD ,
you alone know."
4Then he said to me, "Prophesy to these
bones and say to them, 'Dry bones, hear
the word of the LORD !
5This is what the Sovereign LORD says
to these bones: I will make breath enter
you, and you will come to life.
6I will attach tendons to you and make
flesh come upon you and cover you with
skin; I will put breath in you, and you will
come to life. Then you will know that I
am the LORD .' "
7So I prophesied as I was commanded.
And as I was prophesying, there was a
noise, a rattling sound, and the bones
came together, bone to bone.
8I looked, and tendons and flesh
appeared on them and skin covered
them, but there was no breath in them.
9Then he said to me, "Prophesy to the
breath; prophesy, son of man, and say
to it, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: Come from the four winds, O
breath, and breathe into these slain, that
they may live.' "
10So I prophesied as he commanded me,
and breath entered them; they came to
life and stood up on their feet-a vast
army.
11Then he said to me: "Son of man,
these bones are the whole house of
Israel. They say, 'Our bones are dried
up and our hope is gone; we are cut off.'
12Therefore prophesy and say to them:
'This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
O my people, I am going to open your
graves and bring you up from them; I
will bring you back to the land of Israel.
13Then you, my people, will know that I
am the LORD , when I open your graves
and bring you up from them.
14I will put my Spirit in you and you will
live, and I will settle you in your own
land. Then you will know that I the
LORD have spoken, and I have done it,
declares the LORD .' "
15The word of the LORD came to me:
16"Son of man, take a stick of wood and
write on it, 'Belonging to Judah and the
Israelites associated with him.' Then
take another stick of wood, and write on
it, 'Ephraim's stick, belonging to Joseph
and all the house of Israel associated
with him.'
17Join them together into one stick so
that they will become one in your hand.
18"When your countrymen ask you,
'Won't you tell us what you mean by
this?'
19say to them, 'This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: I am going to
take the stick of Joseph-which is in
Ephraim's hand-and of the Israelite
tribes associated with him, and join it to
Judah's stick, making them a single stick
of wood, and they will become one in
my hand.'
20Hold before their eyes the sticks you
have written on
21and say to them, 'This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: I will take the
Israelites out of the nations where they
have gone. I will gather them from all
around and bring them back into their
own land.
22I will make them one nation in the land,
on the mountains of Israel. There will be
one king over all of them and they will
never again be two nations or be divided
into two kingdoms.
23They will no longer defile themselves
with their idols and vile images or with
any of their offenses, for I will save them
from all their sinful backsliding, and I will
cleanse them. They will be my people,
and I will be their God.
24" 'My servant David will be king over
them, and they will all have one
shepherd. They will follow my laws and
be careful to keep my decrees.
25They will live in the land I gave to my
servant Jacob, the land where your
fathers lived. They and their children
and their children's children will live
there forever, and David my servant will
be their prince forever.
26I will make a covenant of peace with
them; it will be an everlasting covenant.
I will establish them and increase their
numbers, and I will put my sanctuary
among them forever.
27My dwelling place will be with them; I
will be their God, and they will be my
people.
28Then the nations will know that I the
LORD make Israel holy, when my
sanctuary is among them forever.' "
38The word of the LORD came to
me:
2"Son of man, set your face against Gog,
of the land of Magog, the chief prince of
Meshech and Tubal; prophesy against
him
3and say: 'This is what the Sovereign
LORD says: I am against you, O Gog,
chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
4I will turn you around, put hooks in your
jaws and bring you out with your whole
army-your horses, your horsemen fully
armed, and a great horde with large and
small shields, all of them brandishing
their swords.
5Persia, Cush and Put will be with them,
all with shields and helmets,
6also Gomer with all its troops, and Beth
Togarmah from the far north with all its
troops-the many nations with you.
7" 'Get ready; be prepared, you and all
the hordes gathered about you, and
take command of them.
8After many days you will be called to
arms. In future years you will invade a
land that has recovered from war,
whose people were gathered from many
nations to the mountains of Israel, which
had long been desolate. They had been
brought out from the nations, and now
all of them live in safety.
9You and all your troops and the many
nations with you will go up, advancing
like a storm; you will be like a cloud
covering the land.
10" 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: On that day thoughts will come
into your mind and you will devise an
evil scheme.
11You will say, "I will invade a land of
unwalled villages; I will attack a peaceful
and unsuspecting people-all of them
living without walls and without gates
and bars.
12I will plunder and loot and turn my
hand against the resettled ruins and the
people gathered from the nations, rich in
livestock and goods, living at the center
of the land."
13Sheba and Dedan and the merchants
of Tarshish and all her villages will say
to you, "Have you come to plunder?
Have you gathered your hordes to loot,
to carry off silver and gold, to take away
livestock and goods and to seize much
plunder?" '
14"Therefore, son of man, prophesy and
say to Gog: 'This is what the Sovereign
LORD says: In that day, when my
people Israel are living in safety, will you
not take notice of it?
15You will come from your place in the
far north, you and many nations with
you, all of them riding on horses, a great
horde, a mighty army.
16You will advance against my people
Israel like a cloud that covers the land.
In days to come, O Gog, I will bring you
against my land, so that the nations may
know me when I show myself holy
through you before their eyes.
17" 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: Are you not the one I spoke of in
former days by my servants the
prophets of Israel? At that time they
prophesied for years that I would bring
you against them.
18This is what will happen in that day:
When Gog attacks the land of Israel, my
hot anger will be aroused, declares the
Sovereign LORD .
19In my zeal and fiery wrath I declare
that at that time there shall be a great
earthquake in the land of Israel.
20The fish of the sea, the birds of the air,
the beasts of the field, every creature
that moves along the ground, and all the
people on the face of the earth will
tremble at my presence. The mountains
will be overturned, the cliffs will crumble
and every wall will fall to the ground.
21I will summon a sword against Gog on
all my mountains, declares the
Sovereign LORD . Every man's sword
will be against his brother.
22I will execute judgment upon him with
plague and bloodshed; I will pour down
torrents of rain, hailstones and burning
sulfur on him and on his troops and on
the many nations with him.
23And so I will show my greatness and
my holiness, and I will make myself
known in the sight of many nations.
Then they will know that I am the
LORD .'
39"Son of man, prophesy against
Gog and say: 'This is what the
Sovereign LORD says: I am against you,
O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and
Tubal.
2I will turn you around and drag you
along. I will bring you from the far north
and send you against the mountains of
Israel.
3Then I will strike your bow from your left
hand and make your arrows drop from
your right hand.
4On the mountains of Israel you will fall,
you and all your troops and the nations
with you. I will give you as food to all
kinds of carrion birds and to the wild
animals.
5You will fall in the open field, for I have
spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD .
6I will send fire on Magog and on those
who live in safety in the coastlands, and
they will know that I am the LORD .
7" 'I will make known my holy name
among my people Israel. I will no longer
let my holy name be profaned, and the
nations will know that I the LORD am
the Holy One in Israel.
8It is coming! It will surely take place,
declares the Sovereign LORD . This is
the day I have spoken of.
9" 'Then those who live in the towns of
Israel will go out and use the weapons
for fuel and burn them up-the small and
large shields, the bows and arrows, the
war clubs and spears. For seven years
they will use them for fuel.
10They will not need to gather wood from
the fields or cut it from the forests,
because they will use the weapons for
fuel. And they will plunder those who
plundered them and loot those who
looted them, declares the Sovereign
LORD .
11" 'On that day I will give Gog a burial
place in Israel, in the valley of those who
travel east toward the Sea. It will block
the way of travelers, because Gog and
all his hordes will be buried there. So it
will be called the Valley of Hamon Gog.
12" 'For seven months the house of
Israel will be burying them in order to
cleanse the land.
13All the people of the land will bury
them, and the day I am glorified will be a
memorable day for them, declares the
Sovereign LORD .
14" 'Men will be regularly employed to
cleanse the land. Some will go
throughout the land and, in addition to
them, others will bury those that remain
on the ground. At the end of the seven
months they will begin their search.
15As they go through the land and one of
them sees a human bone, he will set up
a marker beside it until the gravediggers
have buried it in the Valley of Hamon
Gog.
16(Also a town called Hamonah will be
there.) And so they will cleanse the
land.'
17"Son of man, this is what the
Sovereign LORD says: Call out to every
kind of bird and all the wild animals:
'Assemble and come together from all
around to the sacrifice I am preparing
for you, the great sacrifice on the
mountains of Israel. There you will eat
flesh and drink blood.
18You will eat the flesh of mighty men
and drink the blood of the princes of the
earth as if they were rams and lambs,
goats and bulls-all of them fattened
animals from Bashan.
19At the sacrifice I am preparing for you,
you will eat fat till you are glutted and
drink blood till you are drunk.
20At my table you will eat your fill of
horses and riders, mighty men and
soldiers of every kind,' declares the
Sovereign LORD .
21"I will display my glory among the
nations, and all the nations will see the
punishment I inflict and the hand I lay
upon them.
22From that day forward the house of
Israel will know that I am the LORD their
God.
23And the nations will know that the
people of Israel went into exile for their
sin, because they were unfaithful to me.
So I hid my face from them and handed
them over to their enemies, and they all
fell by the sword.
24I dealt with them according to their
uncleanness and their offenses, and I
hid my face from them.
25"Therefore this is what the Sovereign
LORD says: I will now bring Jacob back
from captivity and will have compassion
on all the people of Israel, and I will be
zealous for my holy name.
26They will forget their shame and all the
unfaithfulness they showed toward me
when they lived in safety in their land
with no one to make them afraid.
27When I have brought them back from
the nations and have gathered them
from the countries of their enemies, I will
show myself holy through them in the
sight of many nations.
28Then they will know that I am the
LORD their God, for though I sent them
into exile among the nations, I will
gather them to their own land, not
leaving any behind.
29I will no longer hide my face from them,
for I will pour out my Spirit on the house
of Israel, declares the Sovereign
LORD ."
40In the twenty-fifth year of our exile,
at the beginning of the year, on the tenth
of the month, in the fourteenth year after
the fall of the city-on that very day the
hand of the LORD was upon me and he
took me there.
2In visions of God he took me to the land
of Israel and set me on a very high
mountain, on whose south side were
some buildings that looked like a city.
3He took me there, and I saw a man
whose appearance was like bronze; he
was standing in the gateway with a linen
cord and a measuring rod in his hand.
4The man said to me, "Son of man, look
with your eyes and hear with your ears
and pay attention to everything I am
going to show you, for that is why you
have been brought here. Tell the house
of Israel everything you see."
5I saw a wall completely surrounding the
temple area. The length of the
measuring rod in the man's hand was
six long cubits, each of which was a
cubit and a handbreadth. He measured
the wall; it was one measuring rod thick
and one rod high.
6Then he went to the gate facing east.
He climbed its steps and measured the
threshold of the gate; it was one rod
deep.
7The alcoves for the guards were one
rod long and one rod wide, and the
projecting walls between the alcoves
were five cubits thick. And the threshold
of the gate next to the portico facing the
temple was one rod deep.
8Then he measured the portico of the
gateway;
9it was eight cubits deep and its jambs
were two cubits thick. The portico of the
gateway faced the temple.
10Inside the east gate were three
alcoves on each side; the three had the
same measurements, and the faces of
the projecting walls on each side had
the same measurements.
11Then he measured the width of the
entrance to the gateway; it was ten
cubits and its length was thirteen cubits.
12In front of each alcove was a wall one
cubit high, and the alcoves were six
cubits square.
13Then he measured the gateway from
the top of the rear wall of one alcove to
the top of the opposite one; the distance
was twenty-five cubits from one parapet
opening to the opposite one.
14He measured along the faces of the
projecting walls all around the inside of
the gateway-sixty cubits. The
measurement was up to the portico
facing the courtyard.
15The distance from the entrance of the
gateway to the far end of its portico was
fifty cubits.
16The alcoves and the projecting walls
inside the gateway were surmounted by
narrow parapet openings all around, as
was the portico; the openings all around
faced inward. The faces of the
projecting walls were decorated with
palm trees.
17Then he brought me into the outer
court. There I saw some rooms and a
pavement that had been constructed all
around the court; there were thirty
rooms along the pavement.
18It abutted the sides of the gateways
and was as wide as they were long; this
was the lower pavement.
19Then he measured the distance from
the inside of the lower gateway to the
outside of the inner court; it was a
hundred cubits on the east side as well
as on the north.
20Then he measured the length and
width of the gate facing north, leading
into the outer court.
21Its alcoves-three on each side-its
projecting walls and its portico had the
same measurements as those of the
first gateway. It was fifty cubits long and
twenty-five cubits wide.
22Its openings, its portico and its palm
tree decorations had the same
measurements as those of the gate
facing east. Seven steps led up to it,
with its portico opposite them.
23There was a gate to the inner court
facing the north gate, just as there was
on the east. He measured from one gate
to the opposite one; it was a hundred
cubits.
24Then he led me to the south side and I
saw a gate facing south. He measured
its jambs and its portico, and they had
the same measurements as the others.
25The gateway and its portico had
narrow openings all around, like the
openings of the others. It was fifty cubits
long and twenty-five cubits wide.
26Seven steps led up to it, with its
portico opposite them; it had palm tree
decorations on the faces of the
projecting walls on each side.
27The inner court also had a gate facing
south, and he measured from this gate
to the outer gate on the south side; it
was a hundred cubits.
28Then he brought me into the inner
court through the south gate, and he
measured the south gate; it had the
same measurements as the others.
29Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its
portico had the same measurements as
the others. The gateway and its portico
had openings all around. It was fifty
cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
30(The porticoes of the gateways around
the inner court were twenty-five cubits
wide and five cubits deep.)
31Its portico faced the outer court; palm
trees decorated its jambs, and eight
steps led up to it.
32Then he brought me to the inner court
on the east side, and he measured the
gateway; it had the same
measurements as the others.
33Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its
portico had the same measurements as
the others. The gateway and its portico
had openings all around. It was fifty
cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
34Its portico faced the outer court; palm
trees decorated the jambs on either side,
and eight steps led up to it.
35Then he brought me to the north gate
and measured it. It had the same
measurements as the others,
36as did its alcoves, its projecting walls
and its portico, and it had openings all
around. It was fifty cubits long and
twenty-five cubits wide.
37Its portico faced the outer court; palm
trees decorated the jambs on either side,
and eight steps led up to it.
38A room with a doorway was by the
portico in each of the inner gateways,
where the burnt offerings were washed.
39In the portico of the gateway were two
tables on each side, on which the burnt
offerings, sin offerings and guilt offerings
were slaughtered.
40By the outside wall of the portico of the
gateway, near the steps at the entrance
to the north gateway were two tables,
and on the other side of the steps were
two tables.
41So there were four tables on one side
of the gateway and four on the othereight
tables in all-on which the sacrifices
were slaughtered.
42There were also four tables of dressed
stone for the burnt offerings, each a
cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half
wide and a cubit high. On them were
placed the utensils for slaughtering the
burnt offerings and the other sacrifices.
43And double-pronged hooks, each a
handbreadth long, were attached to the
wall all around. The tables were for the
flesh of the offerings.
44Outside the inner gate, within the inner
court, were two rooms, one at the side
of the north gate and facing south, and
another at the side of the south gate and
facing north.
45He said to me, "The room facing south
is for the priests who have charge of the
temple,
46and the room facing north is for the
priests who have charge of the altar.
These are the sons of Zadok, who are
the only Levites who may draw near to
the LORD to minister before him."
47Then he measured the court: It was
square-a hundred cubits long and a
hundred cubits wide. And the altar was
in front of the temple.
48He brought me to the portico of the
temple and measured the jambs of the
portico; they were five cubits wide on
either side. The width of the entrance
was fourteen cubits and its projecting
walls were three cubits wide on either
side.
49The portico was twenty cubits wide,
and twelve cubits from front to back. It
was reached by a flight of stairs, and
there were pillars on each side of the
jambs.
41Then the man brought me to the
outer sanctuary and measured the
jambs; the width of the jambs was six
cubits on each side.
2The entrance was ten cubits wide, and
the projecting walls on each side of it
were five cubits wide. He also measured
the outer sanctuary; it was forty cubits
long and twenty cubits wide.
3Then he went into the inner sanctuary
and measured the jambs of the
entrance; each was two cubits wide.
The entrance was six cubits wide, and
the projecting walls on each side of it
were seven cubits wide.
4And he measured the length of the
inner sanctuary; it was twenty cubits,
and its width was twenty cubits across
the end of the outer sanctuary. He said
to me, "This is the Most Holy Place."
5Then he measured the wall of the
temple; it was six cubits thick, and each
side room around the temple was four
cubits wide.
6The side rooms were on three levels,
one above another, thirty on each level.
There were ledges all around the wall of
the temple to serve as supports for the
side rooms, so that the supports were
not inserted into the wall of the temple.
7The side rooms all around the temple
were wider at each successive level.
The structure surrounding the temple
was built in ascending stages, so that
the rooms widened as one went upward.
A stairway went up from the lowest floor
to the top floor through the middle floor.
8I saw that the temple had a raised base
all around it, forming the foundation of
the side rooms. It was the length of the
rod, six long cubits.
9The outer wall of the side rooms was
five cubits thick. The open area between
the side rooms of the temple
10and the priests' rooms was twenty
cubits wide all around the temple.
11There were entrances to the side
rooms from the open area, one on the
north and another on the south; and the
base adjoining the open area was five
cubits wide all around.
12The building facing the temple
courtyard on the west side was seventy
cubits wide. The wall of the building was
five cubits thick all around, and its length
was ninety cubits.
13Then he measured the temple; it was
a hundred cubits long, and the temple
courtyard and the building with its walls
were also a hundred cubits long.
14The width of the temple courtyard on
the east, including the front of the
temple, was a hundred cubits.
15Then he measured the length of the
building facing the courtyard at the rear
of the temple, including its galleries on
each side; it was a hundred cubits. The
outer sanctuary, the inner sanctuary and
the portico facing the court,
16as well as the thresholds and the
narrow windows and galleries around
the three of them-everything beyond
and including the threshold was covered
with wood. The floor, the wall up to the
windows, and the windows were
covered.
17In the space above the outside of the
entrance to the inner sanctuary and on
the walls at regular intervals all around
the inner and outer sanctuary
18were carved cherubim and palm trees.
Palm trees alternated with cherubim.
Each cherub had two faces:
19the face of a man toward the palm tree
on one side and the face of a lion
toward the palm tree on the other. They
were carved all around the whole temple.
20From the floor to the area above the
entrance, cherubim and palm trees were
carved on the wall of the outer
sanctuary.
21The outer sanctuary had a rectangular
doorframe, and the one at the front of
the Most Holy Place was similar.
22There was a wooden altar three cubits
high and two cubits square ; its corners,
its base and its sides were of wood. The
man said to me, "This is the table that is
before the LORD ."
23Both the outer sanctuary and the Most
Holy Place had double doors.
24Each door had two leaves-two hinged
leaves for each door.
25And on the doors of the outer
sanctuary were carved cherubim and
palm trees like those carved on the
walls, and there was a wooden
overhang on the front of the portico.
26On the sidewalls of the portico were
narrow windows with palm trees carved
on each side. The side rooms of the
temple also had overhangs.
42Then the man led me northward
into the outer court and brought me to
the rooms opposite the temple courtyard
and opposite the outer wall on the north
side.
2The building whose door faced north
was a hundred cubits long and fifty
cubits wide.
3Both in the section twenty cubits from
the inner court and in the section
opposite the pavement of the outer court,
gallery faced gallery at the three levels.
4In front of the rooms was an inner
passageway ten cubits wide and a
hundred cubits long. Their doors were
on the north.
5Now the upper rooms were narrower,
for the galleries took more space from
them than from the rooms on the lower
and middle floors of the building.
6The rooms on the third floor had no
pillars, as the courts had; so they were
smaller in floor space than those on the
lower and middle floors.
7There was an outer wall parallel to the
rooms and the outer court; it extended in
front of the rooms for fifty cubits.
8While the row of rooms on the side next
to the outer court was fifty cubits long,
the row on the side nearest the
sanctuary was a hundred cubits long.
9The lower rooms had an entrance on
the east side as one enters them from
the outer court.
10On the south side along the length of
the wall of the outer court, adjoining the
temple courtyard and opposite the outer
wall, were rooms
11with a passageway in front of them.
These were like the rooms on the north;
they had the same length and width,
with similar exits and dimensions.
Similar to the doorways on the north
12were the doorways of the rooms on
the south. There was a doorway at the
beginning of the passageway that was
parallel to the corresponding wall
extending eastward, by which one
enters the rooms.
13Then he said to me, "The north and
south rooms facing the temple courtyard
are the priests' rooms, where the priests
who approach the LORD will eat the
most holy offerings. There they will put
the most holy offerings-the grain
offerings, the sin offerings and the guilt
offerings-for the place is holy.
14Once the priests enter the holy
precincts, they are not to go into the
outer court until they leave behind the
garments in which they minister, for
these are holy. They are to put on other
clothes before they go near the places
that are for the people."
15When he had finished measuring what
was inside the temple area, he led me
out by the east gate and measured the
area all around:
16He measured the east side with the
measuring rod; it was five hundred
cubits.
17He measured the north side; it was
five hundred cubits by the measuring
rod.
18He measured the south side; it was
five hundred cubits by the measuring
rod.
19Then he turned to the west side and
measured; it was five hundred cubits by
the measuring rod.
20So he measured the area on all four
sides. It had a wall around it, five
hundred cubits long and five hundred
cubits wide, to separate the holy from
the common.
43Then the man brought me to the
gate facing east,
2and I saw the glory of the God of Israel
coming from the east. His voice was like
the roar of rushing waters, and the land
was radiant with his glory.
3The vision I saw was like the vision I
had seen when he came to destroy the
city and like the visions I had seen by
the Kebar River, and I fell facedown.
4The glory of the LORD entered the
temple through the gate facing east.
5Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought
me into the inner court, and the glory of
the LORD filled the temple.
6While the man was standing beside me,
I heard someone speaking to me from
inside the temple.
7He said: "Son of man, this is the place
of my throne and the place for the soles
of my feet. This is where I will live
among the Israelites forever. The house
of Israel will never again defile my holy
name-neither they nor their kings-by
their prostitution and the lifeless idols of
their kings at their high places.
8When they placed their threshold next
to my threshold and their doorposts
beside my doorposts, with only a wall
between me and them, they defiled my
holy name by their detestable practices.
So I destroyed them in my anger.
9Now let them put away from me their
prostitution and the lifeless idols of their
kings, and I will live among them forever.
10"Son of man, describe the temple to
the people of Israel, that they may be
ashamed of their sins. Let them
consider the plan,
11and if they are ashamed of all they
have done, make known to them the
design of the temple-its arrangement, its
exits and entrances-its whole design
and all its regulations and laws. Write
these down before them so that they
may be faithful to its design and follow
all its regulations.
12"This is the law of the temple: All the
surrounding area on top of the mountain
will be most holy. Such is the law of the
temple.
13"These are the measurements of the
altar in long cubits, that cubit being a
cubit and a handbreadth : Its gutter is a
cubit deep and a cubit wide, with a rim
of one span around the edge. And this is
the height of the altar:
14From the gutter on the ground up to
the lower ledge it is two cubits high and
a cubit wide, and from the smaller ledge
up to the larger ledge it is four cubits
high and a cubit wide.
15The altar hearth is four cubits high,
and four horns project upward from the
hearth.
16The altar hearth is square, twelve
cubits long and twelve cubits wide.
17The upper ledge also is square,
fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits
wide, with a rim of half a cubit and a
gutter of a cubit all around. The steps of
the altar face east."
18Then he said to me, "Son of man, this
is what the Sovereign LORD says:
These will be the regulations for
sacrificing burnt offerings and sprinkling
blood upon the altar when it is built:
19You are to give a young bull as a sin
offering to the priests, who are Levites,
of the family of Zadok, who come near
to minister before me, declares the
Sovereign LORD .
20You are to take some of its blood and
put it on the four horns of the altar and
on the four corners of the upper ledge
and all around the rim, and so purify the
altar and make atonement for it.
21You are to take the bull for the sin
offering and burn it in the designated
part of the temple area outside the
sanctuary.
22"On the second day you are to offer a
male goat without defect for a sin
offering, and the altar is to be purified as
it was purified with the bull.
23When you have finished purifying it,
you are to offer a young bull and a ram
from the flock, both without defect.
24You are to offer them before the
LORD , and the priests are to sprinkle
salt on them and sacrifice them as a
burnt offering to the LORD .
25"For seven days you are to provide a
male goat daily for a sin offering; you
are also to provide a young bull and a
ram from the flock, both without defect.
26For seven days they are to make
atonement for the altar and cleanse it;
thus they will dedicate it.
27At the end of these days, from the
eighth day on, the priests are to present
your burnt offerings and fellowship
offerings on the altar. Then I will accept
you, declares the Sovereign LORD ."
44Then the man brought me back to
the outer gate of the sanctuary, the one
facing east, and it was shut.
2The LORD said to me, "This gate is to
remain shut. It must not be opened; no
one may enter through it. It is to remain
shut because the LORD , the God of
Israel, has entered through it.
3The prince himself is the only one who
may sit inside the gateway to eat in the
presence of the LORD . He is to enter
by way of the portico of the gateway and
go out the same way."
4Then the man brought me by way of
the north gate to the front of the temple.
I looked and saw the glory of the LORD
filling the temple of the LORD , and I fell
facedown.
5The LORD said to me, "Son of man,
look carefully, listen closely and give
attention to everything I tell you
concerning all the regulations regarding
the temple of the LORD . Give attention
to the entrance of the temple and all the
exits of the sanctuary.
6Say to the rebellious house of Israel,
'This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
Enough of your detestable practices, O
house of Israel!
7In addition to all your other detestable
practices, you brought foreigners
uncircumcised in heart and flesh into my
sanctuary, desecrating my temple while
you offered me food, fat and blood, and
you broke my covenant.
8Instead of carrying out your duty in
regard to my holy things, you put others
in charge of my sanctuary.
9This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and
flesh is to enter my sanctuary, not even
the foreigners who live among the
Israelites.
10" 'The Levites who went far from me
when Israel went astray and who
wandered from me after their idols must
bear the consequences of their sin.
11They may serve in my sanctuary,
having charge of the gates of the temple
and serving in it; they may slaughter the
burnt offerings and sacrifices for the
people and stand before the people and
serve them.
12But because they served them in the
presence of their idols and made the
house of Israel fall into sin, therefore I
have sworn with uplifted hand that they
must bear the consequences of their sin,
declares the Sovereign LORD .
13They are not to come near to serve me
as priests or come near any of my holy
things or my most holy offerings; they
must bear the shame of their detestable
practices.
14Yet I will put them in charge of the
duties of the temple and all the work that
is to be done in it.
15" 'But the priests, who are Levites and
descendants of Zadok and who faithfully
carried out the duties of my sanctuary
when the Israelites went astray from me,
are to come near to minister before me;
they are to stand before me to offer
sacrifices of fat and blood, declares the
Sovereign LORD .
16They alone are to enter my sanctuary;
they alone are to come near my table to
minister before me and perform my
service.
17" 'When they enter the gates of the
inner court, they are to wear linen
clothes; they must not wear any woolen
garment while ministering at the gates of
the inner court or inside the temple.
18They are to wear linen turbans on their
heads and linen undergarments around
their waists. They must not wear
anything that makes them perspire.
19When they go out into the outer court
where the people are, they are to take
off the clothes they have been
ministering in and are to leave them in
the sacred rooms, and put on other
clothes, so that they do not consecrate
the people by means of their garments.
20" 'They must not shave their heads or
let their hair grow long, but they are to
keep the hair of their heads trimmed.
21No priest is to drink wine when he
enters the inner court.
22They must not marry widows or
divorced women; they may marry only
virgins of Israelite descent or widows of
priests.
23They are to teach my people the
difference between the holy and the
common and show them how to
distinguish between the unclean and the
clean.
24" 'In any dispute, the priests are to
serve as judges and decide it according
to my ordinances. They are to keep my
laws and my decrees for all my
appointed feasts, and they are to keep
my Sabbaths holy.
25" 'A priest must not defile himself by
going near a dead person; however, if
the dead person was his father or
mother, son or daughter, brother or
unmarried sister, then he may defile
himself.
26After he is cleansed, he must wait
seven days.
27On the day he goes into the inner
court of the sanctuary to minister in the
sanctuary, he is to offer a sin offering for
himself, declares the Sovereign LORD .
28" 'I am to be the only inheritance the
priests have. You are to give them no
possession in Israel; I will be their
possession.
29They will eat the grain offerings, the
sin offerings and the guilt offerings; and
everything in Israel devoted to the
LORD will belong to them.
30The best of all the firstfruits and of all
your special gifts will belong to the
priests. You are to give them the first
portion of your ground meal so that a
blessing may rest on your household.
31The priests must not eat anything, bird
or animal, found dead or torn by wild
animals.
45" 'When you allot the land as an
inheritance, you are to present to the
LORD a portion of the land as a sacred
district, 25,000 cubits long and 20,000
cubits wide; the entire area will be holy.
2Of this, a section 500 cubits square is
to be for the sanctuary, with 50 cubits
around it for open land.
3In the sacred district, measure off a
section 25,000 cubits long and 10,000
cubits wide. In it will be the sanctuary,
the Most Holy Place.
4It will be the sacred portion of the land
for the priests, who minister in the
sanctuary and who draw near to
minister before the LORD . It will be a
place for their houses as well as a holy
place for the sanctuary.
5An area 25,000 cubits long and 10,000
cubits wide will belong to the Levites,
who serve in the temple, as their
possession for towns to live in.
6" 'You are to give the city as its property
an area 5,000 cubits wide and 25,000
cubits long, adjoining the sacred portion;
it will belong to the whole house of Israel.
7" 'The prince will have the land
bordering each side of the area formed
by the sacred district and the property of
the city. It will extend westward from the
west side and eastward from the east
side, running lengthwise from the
western to the eastern border parallel to
one of the tribal portions.
8This land will be his possession in
Israel. And my princes will no longer
oppress my people but will allow the
house of Israel to possess the land
according to their tribes.
9" 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: You have gone far enough, O
princes of Israel! Give up your violence
and oppression and do what is just and
right. Stop dispossessing my people,
declares the Sovereign LORD .
10You are to use accurate scales, an
accurate ephah and an accurate bath.
11The ephah and the bath are to be the
same size, the bath containing a tenth of
a homer and the ephah a tenth of a
homer; the homer is to be the standard
measure for both.
12The shekel is to consist of twenty
gerahs. Twenty shekels plus twenty-five
shekels plus fifteen shekels equal one
mina.
13" 'This is the special gift you are to
offer: a sixth of an ephah from each
homer of wheat and a sixth of an ephah
from each homer of barley.
14The prescribed portion of oil,
measured by the bath, is a tenth of a
bath from each cor (which consists of
ten baths or one homer, for ten baths
are equivalent to a homer).
15Also one sheep is to be taken from
every flock of two hundred from the wellwatered
pastures of Israel. These will be
used for the grain offerings, burnt
offerings and fellowship offerings to
make atonement for the people,
declares the Sovereign LORD .
16All the people of the land will
participate in this special gift for the use
of the prince in Israel.
17It will be the duty of the prince to
provide the burnt offerings, grain
offerings and drink offerings at the
festivals, the New Moons and the
Sabbaths-at all the appointed feasts of
the house of Israel. He will provide the
sin offerings, grain offerings, burnt
offerings and fellowship offerings to
make atonement for the house of Israel.
18" 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: In the first month on the first day
you are to take a young bull without
defect and purify the sanctuary.
19The priest is to take some of the blood
of the sin offering and put it on the
doorposts of the temple, on the four
corners of the upper ledge of the altar
and on the gateposts of the inner court.
20You are to do the same on the seventh
day of the month for anyone who sins
unintentionally or through ignorance; so
you are to make atonement for the
temple.
21" 'In the first month on the fourteenth
day you are to observe the Passover, a
feast lasting seven days, during which
you shall eat bread made without yeast.
22On that day the prince is to provide a
bull as a sin offering for himself and for
all the people of the land.
23Every day during the seven days of
the Feast he is to provide seven bulls
and seven rams without defect as a
burnt offering to the LORD , and a male
goat for a sin offering.
24He is to provide as a grain offering an
ephah for each bull and an ephah for
each ram, along with a hin of oil for each
ephah.
25" 'During the seven days of the Feast,
which begins in the seventh month on
the fifteenth day, he is to make the
same provision for sin offerings, burnt
offerings, grain offerings and oil.
46" 'This is what the Sovereign
LORD says: The gate of the inner court
facing east is to be shut on the six
working days, but on the Sabbath day
and on the day of the New Moon it is to
be opened.
2The prince is to enter from the outside
through the portico of the gateway and
stand by the gatepost. The priests are to
sacrifice his burnt offering and his
fellowship offerings. He is to worship at
the threshold of the gateway and then
go out, but the gate will not be shut until
evening.
3On the Sabbaths and New Moons the
people of the land are to worship in the
presence of the LORD at the entrance
to that gateway.
4The burnt offering the prince brings to
the LORD on the Sabbath day is to be
six male lambs and a ram, all without
defect.
5The grain offering given with the ram is
to be an ephah, and the grain offering
with the lambs is to be as much as he
pleases, along with a hin of oil for each
ephah.
6On the day of the New Moon he is to
offer a young bull, six lambs and a ram,
all without defect.
7He is to provide as a grain offering one
ephah with the bull, one ephah with the
ram, and with the lambs as much as he
wants to give, along with a hin of oil with
each ephah.
8When the prince enters, he is to go in
through the portico of the gateway, and
he is to come out the same way.
9" 'When the people of the land come
before the LORD at the appointed feasts,
whoever enters by the north gate to
worship is to go out the south gate; and
whoever enters by the south gate is to
go out the north gate. No one is to
return through the gate by which he
entered, but each is to go out the
opposite gate.
10The prince is to be among them, going
in when they go in and going out when
they go out.
11" 'At the festivals and the appointed
feasts, the grain offering is to be an
ephah with a bull, an ephah with a ram,
and with the lambs as much as one
pleases, along with a hin of oil for each
ephah.
12When the prince provides a freewill
offering to the LORD -whether a burnt
offering or fellowship offerings-the gate
facing east is to be opened for him. He
shall offer his burnt offering or his
fellowship offerings as he does on the
Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and
after he has gone out, the gate will be
shut.
13" 'Every day you are to provide a yearold
lamb without defect for a burnt
offering to the LORD ; morning by
morning you shall provide it.
14You are also to provide with it morning
by morning a grain offering, consisting
of a sixth of an ephah with a third of a
hin of oil to moisten the flour. The
presenting of this grain offering to the
LORD is a lasting ordinance.
15So the lamb and the grain offering and
the oil shall be provided morning by
morning for a regular burnt offering.
16" 'This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: If the prince makes a gift from his
inheritance to one of his sons, it will also
belong to his descendants; it is to be
their property by inheritance.
17If, however, he makes a gift from his
inheritance to one of his servants, the
servant may keep it until the year of
freedom; then it will revert to the prince.
His inheritance belongs to his sons only;
it is theirs.
18The prince must not take any of the
inheritance of the people, driving them
off their property. He is to give his sons
their inheritance out of his own property,
so that none of my people will be
separated from his property.' "
19Then the man brought me through the
entrance at the side of the gate to the
sacred rooms facing north, which
belonged to the priests, and showed me
a place at the western end.
20He said to me, "This is the place
where the priests will cook the guilt
offering and the sin offering and bake
the grain offering, to avoid bringing them
into the outer court and consecrating the
people."
21He then brought me to the outer court
and led me around to its four corners,
and I saw in each corner another court.
22In the four corners of the outer court
were enclosed courts, forty cubits long
and thirty cubits wide; each of the courts
in the four corners was the same size.
23Around the inside of each of the four
courts was a ledge of stone, with places
for fire built all around under the ledge.
24He said to me, "These are the kitchens
where those who minister at the temple
will cook the sacrifices of the people."
47The man brought me back to the
entrance of the temple, and I saw water
coming out from under the threshold of
the temple toward the east (for the
temple faced east). The water was
coming down from under the south side
of the temple, south of the altar.
2He then brought me out through the
north gate and led me around the
outside to the outer gate facing east,
and the water was flowing from the
south side.
3As the man went eastward with a
measuring line in his hand, he
measured off a thousand cubits and
then led me through water that was
ankle-deep.
4He measured off another thousand
cubits and led me through water that
was knee-deep. He measured off
another thousand and led me through
water that was up to the waist.
5He measured off another thousand, but
now it was a river that I could not cross,
because the water had risen and was
deep enough to swim in-a river that no
one could cross.
6He asked me, "Son of man, do you see
this?" Then he led me back to the bank
of the river.
7When I arrived there, I saw a great
number of trees on each side of the river.
8He said to me, "This water flows toward
the eastern region and goes down into
the Arabah, where it enters the Sea.
When it empties into the Sea, the water
there becomes fresh.
9Swarms of living creatures will live
wherever the river flows. There will be
large numbers of fish, because this
water flows there and makes the salt
water fresh; so where the river flows
everything will live.
10Fishermen will stand along the shore;
from En Gedi to En Eglaim there will be
places for spreading nets. The fish will
be of many kinds-like the fish of the
Great Sea.
11But the swamps and marshes will not
become fresh; they will be left for salt.
12Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both
banks of the river. Their leaves will not
wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every
month they will bear, because the water
from the sanctuary flows to them. Their
fruit will serve for food and their leaves
for healing."
13This is what the Sovereign LORD
says: "These are the boundaries by
which you are to divide the land for an
inheritance among the twelve tribes of
Israel, with two portions for Joseph.
14You are to divide it equally among
them. Because I swore with uplifted
hand to give it to your forefathers, this
land will become your inheritance.
15"This is to be the boundary of the land:
"On the north side it will run from the
Great Sea by the Hethlon road past
Lebo Hamath to Zedad,
16Berothah and Sibraim (which lies on
the border between Damascus and
Hamath), as far as Hazer Hatticon,
which is on the border of Hauran.
17The boundary will extend from the sea
to Hazar Enan, along the northern
border of Damascus, with the border of
Hamath to the north. This will be the
north boundary.
18"On the east side the boundary will run
between Hauran and Damascus, along
the Jordan between Gilead and the land
of Israel, to the eastern sea and as far
as Tamar. This will be the east
boundary.
19"On the south side it will run from
Tamar as far as the waters of Meribah
Kadesh, then along the Wadi of Egypt to
the Great Sea. This will be the south
boundary.
20"On the west side, the Great Sea will
be the boundary to a point opposite
Lebo Hamath. This will be the west
boundary.
21"You are to distribute this land among
yourselves according to the tribes of
Israel.
22You are to allot it as an inheritance for
yourselves and for the aliens who have
settled among you and who have
children. You are to consider them as
native-born Israelites; along with you
they are to be allotted an inheritance
among the tribes of Israel.
23In whatever tribe the alien settles,
there you are to give him his
inheritance," declares the Sovereign
LORD .
48"These are the tribes, listed by
name: At the northern frontier, Dan will
have one portion; it will follow the
Hethlon road to Lebo Hamath; Hazar
Enan and the northern border of
Damascus next to Hamath will be part of
its border from the east side to the west
side.
2"Asher will have one portion; it will
border the territory of Dan from east to
west.
3"Naphtali will have one portion; it will
border the territory of Asher from east to
west.
4"Manasseh will have one portion; it will
border the territory of Naphtali from east
to west.
5"Ephraim will have one portion; it will
border the territory of Manasseh from
east to west.
6"Reuben will have one portion; it will
border the territory of Ephraim from east
to west.
7"Judah will have one portion; it will
border the territory of Reuben from east
to west.
8"Bordering the territory of Judah from
east to west will be the portion you are
to present as a special gift. It will be
25,000 cubits wide, and its length from
east to west will equal one of the tribal
portions; the sanctuary will be in the
center of it.
9"The special portion you are to offer to
the LORD will be 25,000 cubits long and
10,000 cubits wide.
10This will be the sacred portion for the
priests. It will be 25,000 cubits long on
the north side, 10,000 cubits wide on the
west side, 10,000 cubits wide on the
east side and 25,000 cubits long on the
south side. In the center of it will be the
sanctuary of the LORD .
11This will be for the consecrated priests,
the Zadokites, who were faithful in
serving me and did not go astray as the
Levites did when the Israelites went
astray.
12It will be a special gift to them from the
sacred portion of the land, a most holy
portion, bordering the territory of the
Levites.
13"Alongside the territory of the priests,
the Levites will have an allotment
25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits
wide. Its total length will be 25,000
cubits and its width 10,000 cubits.
14They must not sell or exchange any of
it. This is the best of the land and must
not pass into other hands, because it is
holy to the LORD .
15"The remaining area, 5,000 cubits
wide and 25,000 cubits long, will be for
the common use of the city, for houses
and for pastureland. The city will be in
the center of it
16and will have these measurements:
the north side 4,500 cubits, the south
side 4,500 cubits, the east side 4,500
cubits, and the west side 4,500 cubits.
17The pastureland for the city will be 250
cubits on the north, 250 cubits on the
south, 250 cubits on the east, and 250
cubits on the west.
18What remains of the area, bordering
on the sacred portion and running the
length of it, will be 10,000 cubits on the
east side and 10,000 cubits on the west
side. Its produce will supply food for the
workers of the city.
19The workers from the city who farm it
will come from all the tribes of Israel.
20The entire portion will be a square,
25,000 cubits on each side. As a special
gift you will set aside the sacred portion,
along with the property of the city.
21"What remains on both sides of the
area formed by the sacred portion and
the city property will belong to the prince.
It will extend eastward from the 25,000
cubits of the sacred portion to the
eastern border, and westward from the
25,000 cubits to the western border.
Both these areas running the length of
the tribal portions will belong to the
prince, and the sacred portion with the
temple sanctuary will be in the center of
them.
22So the property of the Levites and the
property of the city will lie in the center
of the area that belongs to the prince.
The area belonging to the prince will lie
between the border of Judah and the
border of Benjamin.
23"As for the rest of the tribes: Benjamin
will have one portion; it will extend from
the east side to the west side.
24"Simeon will have one portion; it will
border the territory of Benjamin from
east to west.
25"Issachar will have one portion; it will
border the territory of Simeon from east
to west.
26"Zebulun will have one portion; it will
border the territory of Issachar from east
to west.
27"Gad will have one portion; it will
border the territory of Zebulun from east
to west.
28"The southern boundary of Gad will
run south from Tamar to the waters of
Meribah Kadesh, then along the Wadi of
Egypt to the Great Sea.
29"This is the land you are to allot as an
inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and
these will be their portions," declares the
Sovereign LORD .
30"These will be the exits of the city:
Beginning on the north side, which is
4,500 cubits long,
31the gates of the city will be named
after the tribes of Israel. The three gates
on the north side will be the gate of
Reuben, the gate of Judah and the gate
of Levi.
32"On the east side, which is 4,500
cubits long, will be three gates: the gate
of Joseph, the gate of Benjamin and the
gate of Dan.
33"On the south side, which measures
4,500 cubits, will be three gates: the
gate of Simeon, the gate of Issachar
and the gate of Zebulun.
34"On the west side, which is 4,500
cubits long, will be three gates: the gate
of Gad, the gate of Asher and the gate
of Naphtali.
35"The distance all around will be 18,000
cubits. "And the name of the city from
that time on will be: The LORD is
There ."
Daniel
1In the third year of the reign of
Jehoiakim king of Judah,
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came
to Jerusalem and besieged it.
2And the Lord delivered Jehoiakim king
of Judah into his hand, along with some
of the articles from the temple of God.
These he carried off to the temple of his
god in Babylonia and put in the treasure
house of his god.
3Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, chief
of his court officials, to bring in some of
the Israelites from the royal family and
the nobility-
4young men without any physical defect,
handsome, showing aptitude for every
kind of learning, well informed, quick to
understand, and qualified to serve in the
king's palace. He was to teach them the
language and literature of the
Babylonians.
5The king assigned them a daily amount
of food and wine from the king's table.
They were to be trained for three years,
and after that they were to enter the
king's service.
6Among these were some from Judah:
Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.
7The chief official gave them new
names: to Daniel, the name
Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to
Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah,
Abednego.
8But Daniel resolved not to defile himself
with the royal food and wine, and he
asked the chief official for permission
not to defile himself this way.
9Now God had caused the official to
show favor and sympathy to Daniel,
10but the official told Daniel, "I am afraid
of my lord the king, who has assigned
your food and drink. Why should he see
you looking worse than the other young
men your age? The king would then
have my head because of you."
11Daniel then said to the guard whom
the chief official had appointed over
Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah,
12"Please test your servants for ten
days: Give us nothing but vegetables to
eat and water to drink.
13Then compare our appearance with
that of the young men who eat the royal
food, and treat your servants in
accordance with what you see."
14So he agreed to this and tested them
for ten days.
15At the end of the ten days they looked
healthier and better nourished than any
of the young men who ate the royal food.
16So the guard took away their choice
food and the wine they were to drink
and gave them vegetables instead.
17To these four young men God gave
knowledge and understanding of all
kinds of literature and learning. And
Daniel could understand visions and
dreams of all kinds.
18At the end of the time set by the king
to bring them in, the chief official
presented them to Nebuchadnezzar.
19The king talked with them, and he
found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah,
Mishael and Azariah; so they entered
the king's service.
20In every matter of wisdom and
understanding about which the king
questioned them, he found them ten
times better than all the magicians and
enchanters in his whole kingdom.
21And Daniel remained there until the
first year of King Cyrus.
2In the second year of his reign,
Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind
was troubled and he could not sleep.
2So the king summoned the magicians,
enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers to
tell him what he had dreamed. When
they came in and stood before the king,
3he said to them, "I have had a dream
that troubles me and I want to know
what it means. "
4Then the astrologers answered the king
in Aramaic, "O king, live forever! Tell
your servants the dream, and we will
interpret it."
5The king replied to the astrologers,
"This is what I have firmly decided: If
you do not tell me what my dream was
and interpret it, I will have you cut into
pieces and your houses turned into piles
of rubble.
6But if you tell me the dream and explain
it, you will receive from me gifts and
rewards and great honor. So tell me the
dream and interpret it for me."
7Once more they replied, "Let the king
tell his servants the dream, and we will
interpret it."
8Then the king answered, "I am certain
that you are trying to gain time, because
you realize that this is what I have firmly
decided:
9If you do not tell me the dream, there is
just one penalty for you. You have
conspired to tell me misleading and
wicked things, hoping the situation will
change. So then, tell me the dream, and
I will know that you can interpret it for
me."
10The astrologers answered the king,
"There is not a man on earth who can
do what the king asks! No king, however
great and mighty, has ever asked such
a thing of any magician or enchanter or
astrologer.
11What the king asks is too difficult. No
one can reveal it to the king except the
gods, and they do not live among men."
12This made the king so angry and
furious that he ordered the execution of
all the wise men of Babylon.
13So the decree was issued to put the
wise men to death, and men were sent
to look for Daniel and his friends to put
them to death.
14When Arioch, the commander of the
king's guard, had gone out to put to
death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel
spoke to him with wisdom and tact.
15He asked the king's officer, "Why did
the king issue such a harsh decree?"
Arioch then explained the matter to
Daniel.
16At this, Daniel went in to the king and
asked for time, so that he might interpret
the dream for him.
17Then Daniel returned to his house and
explained the matter to his friends
Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.
18He urged them to plead for mercy from
the God of heaven concerning this
mystery, so that he and his friends might
not be executed with the rest of the wise
men of Babylon.
19During the night the mystery was
revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then
Daniel praised the God of heaven
20and said: "Praise be to the name of
God for ever and ever; wisdom and
power are his.
21He changes times and seasons; he
sets up kings and deposes them. He
gives wisdom to the wise and
knowledge to the discerning.
22He reveals deep and hidden things; he
knows what lies in darkness, and light
dwells with him.
23I thank and praise you, O God of my
fathers: You have given me wisdom and
power, you have made known to me
what we asked of you, you have made
known to us the dream of the king."
24Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the
king had appointed to execute the wise
men of Babylon, and said to him, "Do
not execute the wise men of Babylon.
Take me to the king, and I will interpret
his dream for him."
25Arioch took Daniel to the king at once
and said, "I have found a man among
the exiles from Judah who can tell the
king what his dream means."
26The king asked Daniel (also called
Belteshazzar), "Are you able to tell me
what I saw in my dream and interpret
it?"
27Daniel replied, "No wise man,
enchanter, magician or diviner can
explain to the king the mystery he has
asked about,
28but there is a God in heaven who
reveals mysteries. He has shown King
Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in
days to come. Your dream and the
visions that passed through your mind
as you lay on your bed are these:
29"As you were lying there, O king, your
mind turned to things to come, and the
revealer of mysteries showed you what
is going to happen.
30As for me, this mystery has been
revealed to me, not because I have
greater wisdom than other living men,
but so that you, O king, may know the
interpretation and that you may
understand what went through your
mind.
31"You looked, O king, and there before
you stood a large statue-an enormous,
dazzling statue, awesome in
appearance.
32The head of the statue was made of
pure gold, its chest and arms of silver,
its belly and thighs of bronze,
33its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron
and partly of baked clay.
34While you were watching, a rock was
cut out, but not by human hands. It
struck the statue on its feet of iron and
clay and smashed them.
35Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the
silver and the gold were broken to
pieces at the same time and became
like chaff on a threshing floor in the
summer. The wind swept them away
without leaving a trace. But the rock that
struck the statue became a huge
mountain and filled the whole earth.
36"This was the dream, and now we will
interpret it to the king.
37You, O king, are the king of kings. The
God of heaven has given you dominion
and power and might and glory;
38in your hands he has placed mankind
and the beasts of the field and the birds
of the air. Wherever they live, he has
made you ruler over them all. You are
that head of gold.
39"After you, another kingdom will rise,
inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom,
one of bronze, will rule over the whole
earth.
40Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom,
strong as iron-for iron breaks and
smashes everything-and as iron breaks
things to pieces, so it will crush and
break all the others.
41Just as you saw that the feet and toes
were partly of baked clay and partly of
iron, so this will be a divided kingdom;
yet it will have some of the strength of
iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed
with clay.
42As the toes were partly iron and partly
clay, so this kingdom will be partly
strong and partly brittle.
43And just as you saw the iron mixed
with baked clay, so the people will be a
mixture and will not remain united, any
more than iron mixes with clay.
44"In the time of those kings, the God of
heaven will set up a kingdom that will
never be destroyed, nor will it be left to
another people. It will crush all those
kingdoms and bring them to an end, but
it will itself endure forever.
45This is the meaning of the vision of the
rock cut out of a mountain, but not by
human hands-a rock that broke the iron,
the bronze, the clay, the silver and the
gold to pieces. "The great God has
shown the king what will take place in
the future. The dream is true and the
interpretation is trustworthy."
46Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell
prostrate before Daniel and paid him
honor and ordered that an offering and
incense be presented to him.
47The king said to Daniel, "Surely your
God is the God of gods and the Lord of
kings and a revealer of mysteries, for
you were able to reveal this mystery."
48Then the king placed Daniel in a high
position and lavished many gifts on him.
He made him ruler over the entire
province of Babylon and placed him in
charge of all its wise men.
49Moreover, at Daniel's request the king
appointed Shadrach, Meshach and
Abednego administrators over the
province of Babylon, while Daniel
himself remained at the royal court.
3King Nebuchadnezzar made an
image of gold, ninety feet high and nine
feet wide, and set it up on the plain of
Dura in the province of Babylon.
2He then summoned the satraps,
prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers,
judges, magistrates and all the other
provincial officials to come to the
dedication of the image he had set up.
3So the satraps, prefects, governors,
advisers, treasurers, judges,
magistrates and all the other provincial
officials assembled for the dedication of
the image that King Nebuchadnezzar
had set up, and they stood before it.
4Then the herald loudly proclaimed,
"This is what you are commanded to do,
O peoples, nations and men of every
language:
5As soon as you hear the sound of the
horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and
all kinds of music, you must fall down
and worship the image of gold that King
Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
6Whoever does not fall down and
worship will immediately be thrown into
a blazing furnace."
7Therefore, as soon as they heard the
sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp
and all kinds of music, all the peoples,
nations and men of every language fell
down and worshiped the image of gold
that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
8At this time some astrologers came
forward and denounced the Jews.
9They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "O
king, live forever!
10You have issued a decree, O king, that
everyone who hears the sound of the
horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and
all kinds of music must fall down and
worship the image of gold,
11and that whoever does not fall down
and worship will be thrown into a blazing
furnace.
12But there are some Jews whom you
have set over the affairs of the province
of Babylon-Shadrach, Meshach and
Abednego-who pay no attention to you,
O king. They neither serve your gods
nor worship the image of gold you have
set up."
13Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar
summoned Shadrach, Meshach and
Abednego. So these men were brought
before the king,
14and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, "Is
it true, Shadrach, Meshach and
Abednego, that you do not serve my
gods or worship the image of gold I
have set up?
15Now when you hear the sound of the
horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and
all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall
down and worship the image I made,
very good. But if you do not worship it,
you will be thrown immediately into a
blazing furnace. Then what god will be
able to rescue you from my hand?"
16Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
replied to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar,
we do not need to defend ourselves
before you in this matter.
17If we are thrown into the blazing
furnace, the God we serve is able to
save us from it, and he will rescue us
from your hand, O king.
18But even if he does not, we want you
to know, O king, that we will not serve
your gods or worship the image of gold
you have set up."
19Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious
with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego,
and his attitude toward them changed.
He ordered the furnace heated seven
times hotter than usual
20and commanded some of the
strongest soldiers in his army to tie up
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and
throw them into the blazing furnace.
21So these men, wearing their robes,
trousers, turbans and other clothes,
were bound and thrown into the blazing
furnace.
22The king's command was so urgent
and the furnace so hot that the flames of
the fire killed the soldiers who took up
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego,
23and these three men, firmly tied, fell
into the blazing furnace.
24Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to
his feet in amazement and asked his
advisers, "Weren't there three men that
we tied up and threw into the fire?" They
replied, "Certainly, O king."
25He said, "Look! I see four men walking
around in the fire, unbound and
unharmed, and the fourth looks like a
son of the gods."
26Nebuchadnezzar then approached the
opening of the blazing furnace and
shouted, "Shadrach, Meshach and
Abednego, servants of the Most High
God, come out! Come here!" So
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
came out of the fire,
27and the satraps, prefects, governors
and royal advisers crowded around
them. They saw that the fire had not
harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of
their heads singed; their robes were not
scorched, and there was no smell of fire
on them.
28Then Nebuchadnezzar said, "Praise
be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach
and Abednego, who has sent his angel
and rescued his servants! They trusted
in him and defied the king's command
and were willing to give up their lives
rather than serve or worship any god
except their own God.
29Therefore I decree that the people of
any nation or language who say
anything against the God of Shadrach,
Meshach and Abednego be cut into
pieces and their houses be turned into
piles of rubble, for no other god can
save in this way."
30Then the king promoted Shadrach,
Meshach and Abednego in the province
of Babylon.
4King Nebuchadnezzar, To the
peoples, nations and men of every
language, who live in all the world: May
you prosper greatly!
2It is my pleasure to tell you about the
miraculous signs and wonders that the
Most High God has performed for me.
3How great are his signs, how mighty his
wonders! His kingdom is an eternal
kingdom; his dominion endures from
generation to generation.
4I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at home in my
palace, contented and prosperous.
5I had a dream that made me afraid. As I
was lying in my bed, the images and
visions that passed through my mind
terrified me.
6So I commanded that all the wise men
of Babylon be brought before me to
interpret the dream for me.
7When the magicians, enchanters,
astrologers and diviners came, I told
them the dream, but they could not
interpret it for me.
8Finally, Daniel came into my presence
and I told him the dream. (He is called
Belteshazzar, after the name of my god,
and the spirit of the holy gods is in him.)
9I said, "Belteshazzar, chief of the
magicians, I know that the spirit of the
holy gods is in you, and no mystery is
too difficult for you. Here is my dream;
interpret it for me.
10These are the visions I saw while lying
in my bed: I looked, and there before me
stood a tree in the middle of the land. Its
height was enormous.
11The tree grew large and strong and its
top touched the sky; it was visible to the
ends of the earth.
12Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit
abundant, and on it was food for all.
Under it the beasts of the field found
shelter, and the birds of the air lived in
its branches; from it every creature was
fed.
13"In the visions I saw while lying in my
bed, I looked, and there before me was
a messenger, a holy one, coming down
from heaven.
14He called in a loud voice: 'Cut down
the tree and trim off its branches; strip
off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the
animals flee from under it and the birds
from its branches.
15But let the stump and its roots, bound
with iron and bronze, remain in the
ground, in the grass of the field. " 'Let
him be drenched with the dew of heaven,
and let him live with the animals among
the plants of the earth.
16Let his mind be changed from that of a
man and let him be given the mind of an
animal, till seven times pass by for him.
17" 'The decision is announced by
messengers, the holy ones declare the
verdict, so that the living may know that
the Most High is sovereign over the
kingdoms of men and gives them to
anyone he wishes and sets over them
the lowliest of men.'
18"This is the dream that I, King
Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now,
Belteshazzar, tell me what it means, for
none of the wise men in my kingdom
can interpret it for me. But you can,
because the spirit of the holy gods is in
you."
19Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar)
was greatly perplexed for a time, and his
thoughts terrified him. So the king said,
"Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or
its meaning alarm you." Belteshazzar
answered, "My lord, if only the dream
applied to your enemies and its meaning
to your adversaries!
20The tree you saw, which grew large
and strong, with its top touching the sky,
visible to the whole earth,
21with beautiful leaves and abundant
fruit, providing food for all, giving shelter
to the beasts of the field, and having
nesting places in its branches for the
birds of the air-
22you, O king, are that tree! You have
become great and strong; your
greatness has grown until it reaches the
sky, and your dominion extends to
distant parts of the earth.
23"You, O king, saw a messenger, a holy
one, coming down from heaven and
saying, 'Cut down the tree and destroy it,
but leave the stump, bound with iron
and bronze, in the grass of the field,
while its roots remain in the ground. Let
him be drenched with the dew of
heaven; let him live like the wild animals,
until seven times pass by for him.'
24"This is the interpretation, O king, and
this is the decree the Most High has
issued against my lord the king:
25You will be driven away from people
and will live with the wild animals; you
will eat grass like cattle and be
drenched with the dew of heaven.
Seven times will pass by for you until
you acknowledge that the Most High is
sovereign over the kingdoms of men
and gives them to anyone he wishes.
26The command to leave the stump of
the tree with its roots means that your
kingdom will be restored to you when
you acknowledge that Heaven rules.
27Therefore, O king, be pleased to
accept my advice: Renounce your sins
by doing what is right, and your
wickedness by being kind to the
oppressed. It may be that then your
prosperity will continue."
28All this happened to King
Nebuchadnezzar.
29Twelve months later, as the king was
walking on the roof of the royal palace of
Babylon,
30he said, "Is not this the great Babylon I
have built as the royal residence, by my
mighty power and for the glory of my
majesty?"
31The words were still on his lips when a
voice came from heaven, "This is what
is decreed for you, King
Nebuchadnezzar: Your royal authority
has been taken from you.
32You will be driven away from people
and will live with the wild animals; you
will eat grass like cattle. Seven times will
pass by for you until you acknowledge
that the Most High is sovereign over the
kingdoms of men and gives them to
anyone he wishes."
33Immediately what had been said about
Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was
driven away from people and ate grass
like cattle. His body was drenched with
the dew of heaven until his hair grew
like the feathers of an eagle and his
nails like the claws of a bird.
34At the end of that time, I,
Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes
toward heaven, and my sanity was
restored. Then I praised the Most High; I
honored and glorified him who lives
forever. His dominion is an eternal
dominion; his kingdom endures from
generation to generation.
35All the peoples of the earth are
regarded as nothing. He does as he
pleases with the powers of heaven and
the peoples of the earth. No one can
hold back his hand or say to him: "What
have you done?"
36At the same time that my sanity was
restored, my honor and splendor were
returned to me for the glory of my
kingdom. My advisers and nobles
sought me out, and I was restored to my
throne and became even greater than
before.
37Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and
exalt and glorify the King of heaven,
because everything he does is right and
all his ways are just. And those who
walk in pride he is able to humble.
5King Belshazzar gave a great
banquet for a thousand of his nobles
and drank wine with them.
2While Belshazzar was drinking his wine,
he gave orders to bring in the gold and
silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his
father had taken from the temple in
Jerusalem, so that the king and his
nobles, his wives and his concubines
might drink from them.
3So they brought in the gold goblets that
had been taken from the temple of God
in Jerusalem, and the king and his
nobles, his wives and his concubines
drank from them.
4As they drank the wine, they praised
the gods of gold and silver, of bronze,
iron, wood and stone.
5Suddenly the fingers of a human hand
appeared and wrote on the plaster of
the wall, near the lampstand in the royal
palace. The king watched the hand as it
wrote.
6His face turned pale and he was so
frightened that his knees knocked
together and his legs gave way.
7The king called out for the enchanters,
astrologers and diviners to be brought
and said to these wise men of Babylon,
"Whoever reads this writing and tells me
what it means will be clothed in purple
and have a gold chain placed around his
neck, and he will be made the third
highest ruler in the kingdom."
8Then all the king's wise men came in,
but they could not read the writing or tell
the king what it meant.
9So King Belshazzar became even more
terrified and his face grew more pale.
His nobles were baffled.
10The queen, hearing the voices of the
king and his nobles, came into the
banquet hall. "O king, live forever!" she
said. "Don't be alarmed! Don't look so
pale!
11There is a man in your kingdom who
has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In
the time of your father he was found to
have insight and intelligence and
wisdom like that of the gods. King
Nebuchadnezzar your father-your father
the king, I say-appointed him chief of the
magicians, enchanters, astrologers and
diviners.
12This man Daniel, whom the king called
Belteshazzar, was found to have a keen
mind and knowledge and understanding,
and also the ability to interpret dreams,
explain riddles and solve difficult
problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell
you what the writing means."
13So Daniel was brought before the king,
and the king said to him, "Are you
Daniel, one of the exiles my father the
king brought from Judah?
14I have heard that the spirit of the gods
is in you and that you have insight,
intelligence and outstanding wisdom.
15The wise men and enchanters were
brought before me to read this writing
and tell me what it means, but they
could not explain it.
16Now I have heard that you are able to
give interpretations and to solve difficult
problems. If you can read this writing
and tell me what it means, you will be
clothed in purple and have a gold chain
placed around your neck, and you will
be made the third highest ruler in the
kingdom."
17Then Daniel answered the king, "You
may keep your gifts for yourself and give
your rewards to someone else.
Nevertheless, I will read the writing for
the king and tell him what it means.
18"O king, the Most High God gave your
father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and
greatness and glory and splendor.
19Because of the high position he gave
him, all the peoples and nations and
men of every language dreaded and
feared him. Those the king wanted to
put to death, he put to death; those he
wanted to spare, he spared; those he
wanted to promote, he promoted; and
those he wanted to humble, he humbled.
20But when his heart became arrogant
and hardened with pride, he was
deposed from his royal throne and
stripped of his glory.
21He was driven away from people and
given the mind of an animal; he lived
with the wild donkeys and ate grass like
cattle; and his body was drenched with
the dew of heaven, until he
acknowledged that the Most High God is
sovereign over the kingdoms of men
and sets over them anyone he wishes.
22"But you his son, O Belshazzar, have
not humbled yourself, though you knew
all this.
23Instead, you have set yourself up
against the Lord of heaven. You had the
goblets from his temple brought to you,
and you and your nobles, your wives
and your concubines drank wine from
them. You praised the gods of silver and
gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone,
which cannot see or hear or understand.
But you did not honor the God who
holds in his hand your life and all your
ways.
24Therefore he sent the hand that wrote
the inscription.
25"This is the inscription that was written:
Mene , Mene , Tekel , Parsin
26"This is what these words mean:
Mene : God has numbered the days of
your reign and brought it to an end.
27Tekel : You have been weighed on the
scales and found wanting.
28Peres : Your kingdom is divided and
given to the Medes and Persians."
29Then at Belshazzar's command,
Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold
chain was placed around his neck, and
he was proclaimed the third highest
ruler in the kingdom.
30That very night Belshazzar, king of the
Babylonians, was slain,
31and Darius the Mede took over the
kingdom, at the age of sixty-two.
6It pleased Darius to appoint 120
satraps to rule throughout the kingdom,
2with three administrators over them,
one of whom was Daniel. The satraps
were made accountable to them so that
the king might not suffer loss.
3Now Daniel so distinguished himself
among the administrators and the
satraps by his exceptional qualities that
the king planned to set him over the
whole kingdom.
4At this, the administrators and the
satraps tried to find grounds for charges
against Daniel in his conduct of
government affairs, but they were
unable to do so. They could find no
corruption in him, because he was
trustworthy and neither corrupt nor
negligent.
5Finally these men said, "We will never
find any basis for charges against this
man Daniel unless it has something to
do with the law of his God."
6So the administrators and the satraps
went as a group to the king and said: "O
King Darius, live forever!
7The royal administrators, prefects,
satraps, advisers and governors have all
agreed that the king should issue an
edict and enforce the decree that
anyone who prays to any god or man
during the next thirty days, except to you,
O king, shall be thrown into the lions'
den.
8Now, O king, issue the decree and put
it in writing so that it cannot be altered-in
accordance with the laws of the Medes
and Persians, which cannot be
repealed."
9So King Darius put the decree in writing.
10Now when Daniel learned that the
decree had been published, he went
home to his upstairs room where the
windows opened toward Jerusalem.
Three times a day he got down on his
knees and prayed, giving thanks to his
God, just as he had done before.
11Then these men went as a group and
found Daniel praying and asking God for
help.
12So they went to the king and spoke to
him about his royal decree: "Did you not
publish a decree that during the next
thirty days anyone who prays to any god
or man except to you, O king, would be
thrown into the lions' den?" The king
answered, "The decree stands-in
accordance with the laws of the Medes
and Persians, which cannot be
repealed."
13Then they said to the king, "Daniel,
who is one of the exiles from Judah,
pays no attention to you, O king, or to
the decree you put in writing. He still
prays three times a day."
14When the king heard this, he was
greatly distressed; he was determined to
rescue Daniel and made every effort
until sundown to save him.
15Then the men went as a group to the
king and said to him, "Remember, O
king, that according to the law of the
Medes and Persians no decree or edict
that the king issues can be changed."
16So the king gave the order, and they
brought Daniel and threw him into the
lions' den. The king said to Daniel, "May
your God, whom you serve continually,
rescue you!"
17A stone was brought and placed over
the mouth of the den, and the king
sealed it with his own signet ring and
with the rings of his nobles, so that
Daniel's situation might not be changed.
18Then the king returned to his palace
and spent the night without eating and
without any entertainment being brought
to him. And he could not sleep.
19At the first light of dawn, the king got
up and hurried to the lions' den.
20When he came near the den, he called
to Daniel in an anguished voice, "Daniel,
servant of the living God, has your God,
whom you serve continually, been able
to rescue you from the lions?"
21Daniel answered, "O king, live forever!
22My God sent his angel, and he shut
the mouths of the lions. They have not
hurt me, because I was found innocent
in his sight. Nor have I ever done any
wrong before you, O king."
23The king was overjoyed and gave
orders to lift Daniel out of the den. And
when Daniel was lifted from the den, no
wound was found on him, because he
had trusted in his God.
24At the king's command, the men who
had falsely accused Daniel were
brought in and thrown into the lions' den,
along with their wives and children. And
before they reached the floor of the den,
the lions overpowered them and
crushed all their bones.
25Then King Darius wrote to all the
peoples, nations and men of every
language throughout the land: "May you
prosper greatly!
26"I issue a decree that in every part of
my kingdom people must fear and
reverence the God of Daniel. "For he is
the living God and he endures forever;
his kingdom will not be destroyed, his
dominion will never end.
27He rescues and he saves; he performs
signs and wonders in the heavens and
on the earth. He has rescued Daniel
from the power of the lions."
28So Daniel prospered during the reign
of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the
Persian.
7In the first year of Belshazzar king of
Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and
visions passed through his mind as he
was lying on his bed. He wrote down the
substance of his dream.
2Daniel said: "In my vision at night I
looked, and there before me were the
four winds of heaven churning up the
great sea.
3Four great beasts, each different from
the others, came up out of the sea.
4"The first was like a lion, and it had the
wings of an eagle. I watched until its
wings were torn off and it was lifted from
the ground so that it stood on two feet
like a man, and the heart of a man was
given to it.
5"And there before me was a second
beast, which looked like a bear. It was
raised up on one of its sides, and it had
three ribs in its mouth between its teeth.
It was told, 'Get up and eat your fill of
flesh!'
6"After that, I looked, and there before
me was another beast, one that looked
like a leopard. And on its back it had
four wings like those of a bird. This
beast had four heads, and it was given
authority to rule.
7"After that, in my vision at night I looked,
and there before me was a fourth beastterrifying
and frightening and very
powerful. It had large iron teeth; it
crushed and devoured its victims and
trampled underfoot whatever was left. It
was different from all the former beasts,
and it had ten horns.
8"While I was thinking about the horns,
there before me was another horn, a
little one, which came up among them;
and three of the first horns were
uprooted before it. This horn had eyes
like the eyes of a man and a mouth that
spoke boastfully.
9"As I looked, "thrones were set in place,
and the Ancient of Days took his seat.
His clothing was as white as snow; the
hair of his head was white like wool. His
throne was flaming with fire, and its
wheels were all ablaze.
10A river of fire was flowing, coming out
from before him. Thousands upon
thousands attended him; ten thousand
times ten thousand stood before him.
The court was seated, and the books
were opened.
11"Then I continued to watch because of
the boastful words the horn was
speaking. I kept looking until the beast
was slain and its body destroyed and
thrown into the blazing fire.
12(The other beasts had been stripped of
their authority, but were allowed to live
for a period of time.)
13"In my vision at night I looked, and
there before me was one like a son of
man, coming with the clouds of heaven.
He approached the Ancient of Days and
was led into his presence.
14He was given authority, glory and
sovereign power; all peoples, nations
and men of every language worshiped
him. His dominion is an everlasting
dominion that will not pass away, and
his kingdom is one that will never be
destroyed.
15"I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and
the visions that passed through my mind
disturbed me.
16I approached one of those standing
there and asked him the true meaning of
all this. "So he told me and gave me the
interpretation of these things:
17'The four great beasts are four
kingdoms that will rise from the earth.
18But the saints of the Most High will
receive the kingdom and will possess it
forever-yes, for ever and ever.'
19"Then I wanted to know the true
meaning of the fourth beast, which was
different from all the others and most
terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze
claws-the beast that crushed and
devoured its victims and trampled
underfoot whatever was left.
20I also wanted to know about the ten
horns on its head and about the other
horn that came up, before which three of
them fell-the horn that looked more
imposing than the others and that had
eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully.
21As I watched, this horn was waging
war against the saints and defeating
them,
22until the Ancient of Days came and
pronounced judgment in favor of the
saints of the Most High, and the time
came when they possessed the
kingdom.
23"He gave me this explanation: 'The
fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will
appear on earth. It will be different from
all the other kingdoms and will devour
the whole earth, trampling it down and
crushing it.
24The ten horns are ten kings who will
come from this kingdom. After them
another king will arise, different from the
earlier ones; he will subdue three kings.
25He will speak against the Most High
and oppress his saints and try to change
the set times and the laws. The saints
will be handed over to him for a time,
times and half a time.
26" 'But the court will sit, and his power
will be taken away and completely
destroyed forever.
27Then the sovereignty, power and
greatness of the kingdoms under the
whole heaven will be handed over to the
saints, the people of the Most High. His
kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom,
and all rulers will worship and obey him.'
28"This is the end of the matter. I, Daniel,
was deeply troubled by my thoughts,
and my face turned pale, but I kept the
matter to myself."
8In the third year of King Belshazzar's
reign, I, Daniel, had a vision, after the
one that had already appeared to me.
2In my vision I saw myself in the citadel
of Susa in the province of Elam; in the
vision I was beside the Ulai Canal.
3I looked up, and there before me was a
ram with two horns, standing beside the
canal, and the horns were long. One of
the horns was longer than the other but
grew up later.
4I watched the ram as he charged
toward the west and the north and the
south. No animal could stand against
him, and none could rescue from his
power. He did as he pleased and
became great.
5As I was thinking about this, suddenly a
goat with a prominent horn between his
eyes came from the west, crossing the
whole earth without touching the ground.
6He came toward the two-horned ram I
had seen standing beside the canal and
charged at him in great rage.
7I saw him attack the ram furiously,
striking the ram and shattering his two
horns. The ram was powerless to stand
against him; the goat knocked him to the
ground and trampled on him, and none
could rescue the ram from his power.
8The goat became very great, but at the
height of his power his large horn was
broken off, and in its place four
prominent horns grew up toward the
four winds of heaven.
9Out of one of them came another horn,
which started small but grew in power to
the south and to the east and toward the
Beautiful Land.
10It grew until it reached the host of the
heavens, and it threw some of the starry
host down to the earth and trampled on
them.
11It set itself up to be as great as the
Prince of the host; it took away the daily
sacrifice from him, and the place of his
sanctuary was brought low.
12Because of rebellion, the host of the
saints and the daily sacrifice were given
over to it. It prospered in everything it
did, and truth was thrown to the ground.
13Then I heard a holy one speaking, and
another holy one said to him, "How long
will it take for the vision to be fulfilled-the
vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the
rebellion that causes desolation, and the
surrender of the sanctuary and of the
host that will be trampled underfoot?"
14He said to me, "It will take 2,300
evenings and mornings; then the
sanctuary will be reconsecrated."
15While I, Daniel, was watching the
vision and trying to understand it, there
before me stood one who looked like a
man.
16And I heard a man's voice from the
Ulai calling, "Gabriel, tell this man the
meaning of the vision."
17As he came near the place where I
was standing, I was terrified and fell
prostrate. "Son of man," he said to me,
"understand that the vision concerns the
time of the end."
18While he was speaking to me, I was in
a deep sleep, with my face to the
ground. Then he touched me and raised
me to my feet.
19He said: "I am going to tell you what
will happen later in the time of wrath,
because the vision concerns the
appointed time of the end.
20The two-horned ram that you saw
represents the kings of Media and
Persia.
21The shaggy goat is the king of Greece,
and the large horn between his eyes is
the first king.
22The four horns that replaced the one
that was broken off represent four
kingdoms that will emerge from his
nation but will not have the same power.
23"In the latter part of their reign, when
rebels have become completely wicked,
a stern-faced king, a master of intrigue,
will arise.
24He will become very strong, but not by
his own power. He will cause
astounding devastation and will succeed
in whatever he does. He will destroy the
mighty men and the holy people.
25He will cause deceit to prosper, and he
will consider himself superior. When
they feel secure, he will destroy many
and take his stand against the Prince of
princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but
not by human power.
26"The vision of the evenings and
mornings that has been given you is
true, but seal up the vision, for it
concerns the distant future."
27I, Daniel, was exhausted and lay ill for
several days. Then I got up and went
about the king's business. I was
appalled by the vision; it was beyond
understanding.
9In the first year of Darius son of
Xerxes (a Mede by descent), who was
made ruler over the Babylonian
kingdom-
2in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel,
understood from the Scriptures,
according to the word of the Lord given
to Jeremiah the prophet, that the
desolation of Jerusalem would last
seventy years.
3So I turned to the Lord God and
pleaded with him in prayer and petition,
in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes.
4I prayed to the Lord my God and
confessed: "O Lord, the great and
awesome God, who keeps his covenant
of love with all who love him and obey
his commands,
5we have sinned and done wrong. We
have been wicked and have rebelled;
we have turned away from your
commands and laws.
6We have not listened to your servants
the prophets, who spoke in your name
to our kings, our princes and our fathers,
and to all the people of the land.
7"Lord, you are righteous, but this day
we are covered with shame-the men of
Judah and people of Jerusalem and all
Israel, both near and far, in all the
countries where you have scattered us
because of our unfaithfulness to you.
8O Lord , we and our kings, our princes
and our fathers are covered with shame
because we have sinned against you.
9The Lord our God is merciful and
forgiving, even though we have rebelled
against him;
10we have not obeyed the Lord our God
or kept the laws he gave us through his
servants the prophets.
11All Israel has transgressed your law
and turned away, refusing to obey you.
"Therefore the curses and sworn
judgments written in the Law of Moses,
the servant of God, have been poured
out on us, because we have sinned
against you.
12You have fulfilled the words spoken
against us and against our rulers by
bringing upon us great disaster. Under
the whole heaven nothing has ever
been done like what has been done to
Jerusalem.
13Just as it is written in the Law of
Moses, all this disaster has come upon
us, yet we have not sought the favor of
the Lord our God by turning from our
sins and giving attention to your truth.
14The Lord did not hesitate to bring the
disaster upon us, for the Lord our God is
righteous in everything he does; yet we
have not obeyed him.
15"Now, O Lord our God, who brought
your people out of Egypt with a mighty
hand and who made for yourself a name
that endures to this day, we have sinned,
we have done wrong.
16O Lord, in keeping with all your
righteous acts, turn away your anger
and your wrath from Jerusalem, your
city, your holy hill. Our sins and the
iniquities of our fathers have made
Jerusalem and your people an object of
scorn to all those around us.
17"Now, our God, hear the prayers and
petitions of your servant. For your sake,
O Lord, look with favor on your desolate
sanctuary.
18Give ear, O God, and hear; open your
eyes and see the desolation of the city
that bears your Name. We do not make
requests of you because we are
righteous, but because of your great
mercy.
19O Lord, listen! O Lord, forgive! O Lord,
hear and act! For your sake, O my God,
do not delay, because your city and your
people bear your Name."
20While I was speaking and praying,
confessing my sin and the sin of my
people Israel and making my request to
the Lord my God for his holy hill-
21while I was still in prayer, Gabriel, the
man I had seen in the earlier vision,
came to me in swift flight about the time
of the evening sacrifice.
22He instructed me and said to me,
"Daniel, I have now come to give you
insight and understanding.
23As soon as you began to pray, an
answer was given, which I have come to
tell you, for you are highly esteemed.
Therefore, consider the message and
understand the vision:
24"Seventy 'sevens' are decreed for your
people and your holy city to finish
transgression, to put an end to sin, to
atone for wickedness, to bring in
everlasting righteousness, to seal up
vision and prophecy and to anoint the
most holy.
25"Know and understand this: From the
issuing of the decree to restore and
rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed
One, the ruler, comes, there will be
seven 'sevens,' and sixty-two 'sevens.' It
will be rebuilt with streets and a trench,
but in times of trouble.
26After the sixty-two 'sevens,' the
Anointed One will be cut off and will
have nothing. The people of the ruler
who will come will destroy the city and
the sanctuary. The end will come like a
flood: War will continue until the end,
and desolations have been decreed.
27He will confirm a covenant with many
for one 'seven.' In the middle of the
'seven' he will put an end to sacrifice
and offering. And on a wing of the
temple he will set up an abomination
that causes desolation, until the end that
is decreed is poured out on him. "
10In the third year of Cyrus king of
Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel
(who was called Belteshazzar). Its
message was true and it concerned a
great war. The understanding of the
message came to him in a vision.
2At that time I, Daniel, mourned for three
weeks.
3I ate no choice food; no meat or wine
touched my lips; and I used no lotions at
all until the three weeks were over.
4On the twenty-fourth day of the first
month, as I was standing on the bank of
the great river, the Tigris,
5I looked up and there before me was a
man dressed in linen, with a belt of the
finest gold around his waist.
6His body was like chrysolite, his face
like lightning, his eyes like flaming
torches, his arms and legs like the
gleam of burnished bronze, and his
voice like the sound of a multitude.
7I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the
vision; the men with me did not see it,
but such terror overwhelmed them that
they fled and hid themselves.
8So I was left alone, gazing at this great
vision; I had no strength left, my face
turned deathly pale and I was helpless.
9Then I heard him speaking, and as I
listened to him, I fell into a deep sleep,
my face to the ground.
10A hand touched me and set me
trembling on my hands and knees.
11He said, "Daniel, you who are highly
esteemed, consider carefully the words I
am about to speak to you, and stand up,
for I have now been sent to you." And
when he said this to me, I stood up
trembling.
12Then he continued, "Do not be afraid,
Daniel. Since the first day that you set
your mind to gain understanding and to
humble yourself before your God, your
words were heard, and I have come in
response to them.
13But the prince of the Persian kingdom
resisted me twenty-one days. Then
Michael, one of the chief princes, came
to help me, because I was detained
there with the king of Persia.
14Now I have come to explain to you
what will happen to your people in the
future, for the vision concerns a time yet
to come."
15While he was saying this to me, I
bowed with my face toward the ground
and was speechless.
16Then one who looked like a man
touched my lips, and I opened my
mouth and began to speak. I said to the
one standing before me, "I am
overcome with anguish because of the
vision, my lord, and I am helpless.
17How can I, your servant, talk with you,
my lord? My strength is gone and I can
hardly breathe."
18Again the one who looked like a man
touched me and gave me strength.
19"Do not be afraid, O man highly
esteemed," he said. "Peace! Be strong
now; be strong." When he spoke to me,
I was strengthened and said, "Speak,
my lord, since you have given me
strength."
20So he said, "Do you know why I have
come to you? Soon I will return to fight
against the prince of Persia, and when I
go, the prince of Greece will come;
21but first I will tell you what is written in
the Book of Truth. (No one supports me
against them except Michael, your
prince.
11And in the first year of Darius the
Mede, I took my stand to support and
protect him.)
2"Now then, I tell you the truth: Three
more kings will appear in Persia, and
then a fourth, who will be far richer than
all the others. When he has gained
power by his wealth, he will stir up
everyone against the kingdom of
Greece.
3Then a mighty king will appear, who will
rule with great power and do as he
pleases.
4After he has appeared, his empire will
be broken up and parceled out toward
the four winds of heaven. It will not go to
his descendants, nor will it have the
power he exercised, because his empire
will be uprooted and given to others.
5"The king of the South will become
strong, but one of his commanders will
become even stronger than he and will
rule his own kingdom with great power.
6After some years, they will become
allies. The daughter of the king of the
South will go to the king of the North to
make an alliance, but she will not retain
her power, and he and his power will not
last. In those days she will be handed
over, together with her royal escort and
her father and the one who supported
her.
7"One from her family line will arise to
take her place. He will attack the forces
of the king of the North and enter his
fortress; he will fight against them and
be victorious.
8He will also seize their gods, their metal
images and their valuable articles of
silver and gold and carry them off to
Egypt. For some years he will leave the
king of the North alone.
9Then the king of the North will invade
the realm of the king of the South but
will retreat to his own country.
10His sons will prepare for war and
assemble a great army, which will
sweep on like an irresistible flood and
carry the battle as far as his fortress.
11"Then the king of the South will march
out in a rage and fight against the king
of the North, who will raise a large army,
but it will be defeated.
12When the army is carried off, the king
of the South will be filled with pride and
will slaughter many thousands, yet he
will not remain triumphant.
13For the king of the North will muster
another army, larger than the first; and
after several years, he will advance with
a huge army fully equipped.
14"In those times many will rise against
the king of the South. The violent men
among your own people will rebel in
fulfillment of the vision, but without
success.
15Then the king of the North will come
and build up siege ramps and will
capture a fortified city. The forces of the
South will be powerless to resist; even
their best troops will not have the
strength to stand.
16The invader will do as he pleases; no
one will be able to stand against him. He
will establish himself in the Beautiful
Land and will have the power to destroy
it.
17He will determine to come with the
might of his entire kingdom and will
make an alliance with the king of the
South. And he will give him a daughter
in marriage in order to overthrow the
kingdom, but his plans will not succeed
or help him.
18Then he will turn his attention to the
coastlands and will take many of them,
but a commander will put an end to his
insolence and will turn his insolence
back upon him.
19After this, he will turn back toward the
fortresses of his own country but will
stumble and fall, to be seen no more.
20"His successor will send out a tax
collector to maintain the royal splendor.
In a few years, however, he will be
destroyed, yet not in anger or in battle.
21"He will be succeeded by a
contemptible person who has not been
given the honor of royalty. He will invade
the kingdom when its people feel secure,
and he will seize it through intrigue.
22Then an overwhelming army will be
swept away before him; both it and a
prince of the covenant will be destroyed.
23After coming to an agreement with him,
he will act deceitfully, and with only a
few people he will rise to power.
24When the richest provinces feel secure,
he will invade them and will achieve
what neither his fathers nor his
forefathers did. He will distribute plunder,
loot and wealth among his followers. He
will plot the overthrow of fortresses-but
only for a time.
25"With a large army he will stir up his
strength and courage against the king of
the South. The king of the South will
wage war with a large and very powerful
army, but he will not be able to stand
because of the plots devised against
him.
26Those who eat from the king's
provisions will try to destroy him; his
army will be swept away, and many will
fall in battle.
27The two kings, with their hearts bent
on evil, will sit at the same table and lie
to each other, but to no avail, because
an end will still come at the appointed
time.
28The king of the North will return to his
own country with great wealth, but his
heart will be set against the holy
covenant. He will take action against it
and then return to his own country.
29"At the appointed time he will invade
the South again, but this time the
outcome will be different from what it
was before.
30Ships of the western coastlands will
oppose him, and he will lose heart. Then
he will turn back and vent his fury
against the holy covenant. He will return
and show favor to those who forsake the
holy covenant.
31"His armed forces will rise up to
desecrate the temple fortress and will
abolish the daily sacrifice. Then they will
set up the abomination that causes
desolation.
32With flattery he will corrupt those who
have violated the covenant, but the
people who know their God will firmly
resist him.
33"Those who are wise will instruct many,
though for a time they will fall by the
sword or be burned or captured or
plundered.
34When they fall, they will receive a little
help, and many who are not sincere will
join them.
35Some of the wise will stumble, so that
they may be refined, purified and made
spotless until the time of the end, for it
will still come at the appointed time.
36"The king will do as he pleases. He will
exalt and magnify himself above every
god and will say unheard-of things
against the God of gods. He will be
successful until the time of wrath is
completed, for what has been
determined must take place.
37He will show no regard for the gods of
his fathers or for the one desired by
women, nor will he regard any god, but
will exalt himself above them all.
38Instead of them, he will honor a god of
fortresses; a god unknown to his fathers
he will honor with gold and silver, with
precious stones and costly gifts.
39He will attack the mightiest fortresses
with the help of a foreign god and will
greatly honor those who acknowledge
him. He will make them rulers over
many people and will distribute the land
at a price.
40"At the time of the end the king of the
South will engage him in battle, and the
king of the North will storm out against
him with chariots and cavalry and a
great fleet of ships. He will invade many
countries and sweep through them like a
flood.
41He will also invade the Beautiful Land.
Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab
and the leaders of Ammon will be
delivered from his hand.
42He will extend his power over many
countries; Egypt will not escape.
43He will gain control of the treasures of
gold and silver and all the riches of
Egypt, with the Libyans and Nubians in
submission.
44But reports from the east and the north
will alarm him, and he will set out in a
great rage to destroy and annihilate
many.
45He will pitch his royal tents between
the seas at the beautiful holy mountain.
Yet he will come to his end, and no one
will help him.
12"At that time Michael, the great
prince who protects your people, will
arise. There will be a time of distress
such as has not happened from the
beginning of nations until then. But at
that time your people-everyone whose
name is found written in the book-will be
delivered.
2Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the
earth will awake: some to everlasting life,
others to shame and everlasting
contempt.
3Those who are wise will shine like the
brightness of the heavens, and those
who lead many to righteousness, like
the stars for ever and ever.
4But you, Daniel, close up and seal the
words of the scroll until the time of the
end. Many will go here and there to
increase knowledge."
5Then I, Daniel, looked, and there before
me stood two others, one on this bank
of the river and one on the opposite
bank.
6One of them said to the man clothed in
linen, who was above the waters of the
river, "How long will it be before these
astonishing things are fulfilled?"
7The man clothed in linen, who was
above the waters of the river, lifted his
right hand and his left hand toward
heaven, and I heard him swear by him
who lives forever, saying, "It will be for a
time, times and half a time. When the
power of the holy people has been
finally broken, all these things will be
completed."
8I heard, but I did not understand. So I
asked, "My lord, what will the outcome
of all this be?"
9He replied, "Go your way, Daniel,
because the words are closed up and
sealed until the time of the end.
10Many will be purified, made spotless
and refined, but the wicked will continue
to be wicked. None of the wicked will
understand, but those who are wise will
understand.
11"From the time that the daily sacrifice
is abolished and the abomination that
causes desolation is set up, there will be
1,290 days.
12Blessed is the one who waits for and
reaches the end of the 1,335 days.
13"As for you, go your way till the end.
You will rest, and then at the end of the
days you will rise to receive your allotted
inheritance."
Hosea
1The word of the Lord that came to
Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of
Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah,
kings of Judah, and during the reign of
Jeroboam son of Jehoash king of Israel:
2When the Lord began to speak through
Hosea, the Lord said to him, "Go, take
to yourself an adulterous wife and
children of unfaithfulness, because the
land is guilty of the vilest adultery in
departing from the Lord ."
3So he married Gomer daughter of
Diblaim, and she conceived and bore
him a son.
4Then the Lord said to Hosea, "Call him
Jezreel, because I will soon punish the
house of Jehu for the massacre at
Jezreel, and I will put an end to the
kingdom of Israel.
5In that day I will break Israel's bow in
the Valley of Jezreel."
6Gomer conceived again and gave birth
to a daughter. Then the Lord said to
Hosea, "Call her Lo-Ruhamah, for I will
no longer show love to the house of
Israel, that I should at all forgive them.
7Yet I will show love to the house of
Judah; and I will save them-not by bow,
sword or battle, or by horses and
horsemen, but by the Lord their God."
8After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah,
Gomer had another son.
9Then the Lord said, "Call him Lo-Ammi,
for you are not my people, and I am not
your God.
10"Yet the Israelites will be like the sand
on the seashore, which cannot be
measured or counted. In the place
where it was said to them, 'You are not
my people,' they will be called 'sons of
the living God.'
11The people of Judah and the people of
Israel will be reunited, and they will
appoint one leader and will come up out
of the land, for great will be the day of
Jezreel.
2"Say of your brothers, 'My people,'
and of your sisters, 'My loved one.'
2"Rebuke your mother, rebuke her, for
she is not my wife, and I am not her
husband. Let her remove the adulterous
look from her face and the
unfaithfulness from between her breasts.
3Otherwise I will strip her naked and
make her as bare as on the day she
was born; I will make her like a desert,
turn her into a parched land, and slay
her with thirst.
4I will not show my love to her children,
because they are the children of
adultery.
5Their mother has been unfaithful and
has conceived them in disgrace. She
said, 'I will go after my lovers, who give
me my food and my water, my wool and
my linen, my oil and my drink.'
6Therefore I will block her path with
thornbushes; I will wall her in so that she
cannot find her way.
7She will chase after her lovers but not
catch them; she will look for them but
not find them. Then she will say, 'I will
go back to my husband as at first, for
then I was better off than now.'
8She has not acknowledged that I was
the one who gave her the grain, the new
wine and oil, who lavished on her the
silver and gold- which they used for Baal.
9"Therefore I will take away my grain
when it ripens, and my new wine when it
is ready. I will take back my wool and
my linen, intended to cover her
nakedness.
10So now I will expose her lewdness
before the eyes of her lovers; no one will
take her out of my hands.
11I will stop all her celebrations: her
yearly festivals, her New Moons, her
Sabbath days-all her appointed feasts.
12I will ruin her vines and her fig trees,
which she said were her pay from her
lovers; I will make them a thicket, and
wild animals will devour them.
13I will punish her for the days she
burned incense to the Baals; she
decked herself with rings and jewelry,
and went after her lovers, but me she
forgot," declares the Lord .
14"Therefore I am now going to allure
her; I will lead her into the desert and
speak tenderly to her.
15There I will give her back her
vineyards, and will make the Valley of
Achor a door of hope. There she will
sing as in the days of her youth, as in
the day she came up out of Egypt.
16"In that day," declares the Lord , "you
will call me 'my husband'; you will no
longer call me 'my master. '
17I will remove the names of the Baals
from her lips; no longer will their names
be invoked.
18In that day I will make a covenant for
them with the beasts of the field and the
birds of the air and the creatures that
move along the ground. Bow and sword
and battle I will abolish from the land, so
that all may lie down in safety.
19I will betroth you to me forever; I will
betroth you in righteousness and justice,
in love and compassion.
20I will betroth you in faithfulness, and
you will acknowledge the Lord .
21"In that day I will respond," declares
the Lord - "I will respond to the skies,
and they will respond to the earth;
22and the earth will respond to the grain,
the new wine and oil, and they will
respond to Jezreel.
23I will plant her for myself in the land; I
will show my love to the one I called 'Not
my loved one. ' I will say to those called
'Not my people, ' 'You are my people';
and they will say, 'You are my God.' "
3The Lord said to me, "Go, show your
love to your wife again, though she is
loved by another and is an adulteress.
Love her as the Lord loves the Israelites,
though they turn to other gods and love
the sacred raisin cakes."
2So I bought her for fifteen shekels of
silver and about a homer and a lethek of
barley.
3Then I told her, "You are to live with me
many days; you must not be a prostitute
or be intimate with any man, and I will
live with you."
4For the Israelites will live many days
without king or prince, without sacrifice
or sacred stones, without ephod or idol.
5Afterward the Israelites will return and
seek the Lord their God and David their
king. They will come trembling to the
Lord and to his blessings in the last
days.
4Hear the word of the Lord , you
Israelites, because the Lord has a
charge to bring against you who live in
the land: "There is no faithfulness, no
love, no acknowledgment of God in the
land.
2There is only cursing, lying and murder,
stealing and adultery; they break all
bounds, and bloodshed follows
bloodshed.
3Because of this the land mourns, and
all who live in it waste away; the beasts
of the field and the birds of the air and
the fish of the sea are dying.
4"But let no man bring a charge, let no
man accuse another, for your people
are like those who bring charges against
a priest.
5You stumble day and night, and the
prophets stumble with you. So I will
destroy your mother-
6my people are destroyed from lack of
knowledge. "Because you have rejected
knowledge, I also reject you as my
priests; because you have ignored the
law of your God, I also will ignore your
children.
7The more the priests increased, the
more they sinned against me; they
exchanged their Glory for something
disgraceful.
8They feed on the sins of my people and
relish their wickedness.
9And it will be: Like people, like priests. I
will punish both of them for their ways
and repay them for their deeds.
10"They will eat but not have enough;
they will engage in prostitution but not
increase, because they have deserted
the Lord to give themselves
11to prostitution, to old wine and new,
which take away the understanding
12of my people. They consult a wooden
idol and are answered by a stick of
wood. A spirit of prostitution leads them
astray; they are unfaithful to their God.
13They sacrifice on the mountaintops
and burn offerings on the hills, under
oak, poplar and terebinth, where the
shade is pleasant. Therefore your
daughters turn to prostitution and your
daughters-in-law to adultery.
14"I will not punish your daughters when
they turn to prostitution, nor your
daughters-in-law when they commit
adultery, because the men themselves
consort with harlots and sacrifice with
shrine prostitutes- a people without
understanding will come to ruin!
15"Though you commit adultery, O Israel,
let not Judah become guilty. "Do not go
to Gilgal; do not go up to Beth Aven.
And do not swear, 'As surely as the Lord
lives!'
16The Israelites are stubborn, like a
stubborn heifer. How then can the Lord
pasture them like lambs in a meadow?
17Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him
alone!
18Even when their drinks are gone, they
continue their prostitution; their rulers
dearly love shameful ways.
19A whirlwind will sweep them away, and
their sacrifices will bring them shame.
5"Hear this, you priests! Pay attention,
you Israelites! Listen, O royal house!
This judgment is against you: You have
been a snare at Mizpah, a net spread
out on Tabor.
2The rebels are deep in slaughter. I will
discipline all of them.
3I know all about Ephraim; Israel is not
hidden from me. Ephraim, you have now
turned to prostitution; Israel is corrupt.
4"Their deeds do not permit them to
return to their God. A spirit of
prostitution is in their heart; they do not
acknowledge the Lord .
5Israel's arrogance testifies against
them; the Israelites, even Ephraim,
stumble in their sin; Judah also
stumbles with them.
6When they go with their flocks and
herds to seek the Lord , they will not find
him; he has withdrawn himself from
them.
7They are unfaithful to the Lord ; they
give birth to illegitimate children. Now
their New Moon festivals will devour
them and their fields.
8"Sound the trumpet in Gibeah, the horn
in Ramah. Raise the battle cry in Beth
Aven ; lead on, O Benjamin.
9Ephraim will be laid waste on the day of
reckoning. Among the tribes of Israel I
proclaim what is certain.
10Judah's leaders are like those who
move boundary stones. I will pour out
my wrath on them like a flood of water.
11Ephraim is oppressed, trampled in
judgment, intent on pursuing idols.
12I am like a moth to Ephraim, like rot to
the people of Judah.
13"When Ephraim saw his sickness, and
Judah his sores, then Ephraim turned to
Assyria, and sent to the great king for
help. But he is not able to cure you, not
able to heal your sores.
14For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, like
a great lion to Judah. I will tear them to
pieces and go away; I will carry them off,
with no one to rescue them.
15Then I will go back to my place until
they admit their guilt. And they will seek
my face; in their misery they will
earnestly seek me."
6"Come, let us return to the Lord . He
has torn us to pieces but he will heal us;
he has injured us but he will bind up our
wounds.
2After two days he will revive us; on the
third day he will restore us, that we may
live in his presence.
3Let us acknowledge the Lord ; let us
press on to acknowledge him. As surely
as the sun rises, he will appear; he will
come to us like the winter rains, like the
spring rains that water the earth."
4"What can I do with you, Ephraim?
What can I do with you, Judah? Your
love is like the morning mist, like the
early dew that disappears.
5Therefore I cut you in pieces with my
prophets, I killed you with the words of
my mouth; my judgments flashed like
lightning upon you.
6For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and
acknowledgment of God rather than
burnt offerings.
7Like Adam, they have broken the
covenant- they were unfaithful to me
there.
8Gilead is a city of wicked men, stained
with footprints of blood.
9As marauders lie in ambush for a man,
so do bands of priests; they murder on
the road to Shechem, committing
shameful crimes.
10I have seen a horrible thing in the
house of Israel. There Ephraim is given
to prostitution and Israel is defiled.
11"Also for you, Judah, a harvest is
appointed. "Whenever I would restore
the fortunes of my people,
7whenever I would heal Israel, the
sins of Ephraim are exposed and the
crimes of Samaria revealed. They
practice deceit, thieves break into
houses, bandits rob in the streets;
2but they do not realize that I remember
all their evil deeds. Their sins engulf
them; they are always before me.
3"They delight the king with their
wickedness, the princes with their lies.
4They are all adulterers, burning like an
oven whose fire the baker need not stir
from the kneading of the dough till it
rises.
5On the day of the festival of our king
the princes become inflamed with wine,
and he joins hands with the mockers.
6Their hearts are like an oven; they
approach him with intrigue. Their
passion smolders all night; in the
morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
7All of them are hot as an oven; they
devour their rulers. All their kings fall,
and none of them calls on me.
8"Ephraim mixes with the nations;
Ephraim is a flat cake not turned over.
9Foreigners sap his strength, but he
does not realize it. His hair is sprinkled
with gray, but he does not notice.
10Israel's arrogance testifies against him,
but despite all this he does not return to
the Lord his God or search for him.
11"Ephraim is like a dove, easily
deceived and senseless- now calling to
Egypt, now turning to Assyria.
12When they go, I will throw my net over
them; I will pull them down like birds of
the air. When I hear them flocking
together, I will catch them.
13Woe to them, because they have
strayed from me! Destruction to them,
because they have rebelled against me!
I long to redeem them but they speak
lies against me.
14They do not cry out to me from their
hearts but wail upon their beds. They
gather together for grain and new wine
but turn away from me.
15I trained them and strengthened them,
but they plot evil against me.
16They do not turn to the Most High;
they are like a faulty bow. Their leaders
will fall by the sword because of their
insolent words. For this they will be
ridiculed in the land of Egypt.
8"Put the trumpet to your lips! An
eagle is over the house of the Lord
because the people have broken my
covenant and rebelled against my law.
2Israel cries out to me, 'O our God, we
acknowledge you!'
3But Israel has rejected what is good; an
enemy will pursue him.
4They set up kings without my consent;
they choose princes without my
approval. With their silver and gold they
make idols for themselves to their own
destruction.
5Throw out your calf-idol, O Samaria! My
anger burns against them. How long will
they be incapable of purity?
6They are from Israel! This calf-a
craftsman has made it; it is not God. It
will be broken in pieces, that calf of
Samaria.
7"They sow the wind and reap the
whirlwind. The stalk has no head; it will
produce no flour. Were it to yield grain,
foreigners would swallow it up.
8Israel is swallowed up; now she is
among the nations like a worthless thing.
9For they have gone up to Assyria like a
wild donkey wandering alone. Ephraim
has sold herself to lovers.
10Although they have sold themselves
among the nations, I will now gather
them together. They will begin to waste
away under the oppression of the
mighty king.
11"Though Ephraim built many altars for
sin offerings, these have become altars
for sinning.
12I wrote for them the many things of my
law, but they regarded them as
something alien.
13They offer sacrifices given to me and
they eat the meat, but the Lord is not
pleased with them. Now he will
remember their wickedness and punish
their sins: They will return to Egypt.
14Israel has forgotten his Maker and built
palaces; Judah has fortified many towns.
But I will send fire upon their cities that
will consume their fortresses."
9Do not rejoice, O Israel; do not be
jubilant like the other nations. For you
have been unfaithful to your God; you
love the wages of a prostitute at every
threshing floor.
2Threshing floors and winepresses will
not feed the people; the new wine will
fail them.
3They will not remain in the Lord 's land;
Ephraim will return to Egypt and eat
unclean food in Assyria.
4They will not pour out wine offerings to
the Lord , nor will their sacrifices please
him. Such sacrifices will be to them like
the bread of mourners; all who eat them
will be unclean. This food will be for
themselves; it will not come into the
temple of the Lord .
5What will you do on the day of your
appointed feasts, on the festival days of
the Lord ?
6Even if they escape from destruction,
Egypt will gather them, and Memphis
will bury them. Their treasures of silver
will be taken over by briers, and thorns
will overrun their tents.
7The days of punishment are coming,
the days of reckoning are at hand. Let
Israel know this. Because your sins are
so many and your hostility so great, the
prophet is considered a fool, the
inspired man a maniac.
8The prophet, along with my God, is the
watchman over Ephraim, yet snares
await him on all his paths, and hostility
in the house of his God.
9They have sunk deep into corruption,
as in the days of Gibeah. God will
remember their wickedness and punish
them for their sins.
10"When I found Israel, it was like finding
grapes in the desert; when I saw your
fathers, it was like seeing the early fruit
on the fig tree. But when they came to
Baal Peor, they consecrated themselves
to that shameful idol and became as vile
as the thing they loved.
11Ephraim's glory will fly away like a
bird- no birth, no pregnancy, no
conception.
12Even if they rear children, I will
bereave them of every one. Woe to
them when I turn away from them!
13I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre,
planted in a pleasant place. But Ephraim
will bring out their children to the slayer."
14Give them, O Lord - what will you give
them? Give them wombs that miscarry
and breasts that are dry.
15"Because of all their wickedness in
Gilgal, I hated them there. Because of
their sinful deeds, I will drive them out of
my house. I will no longer love them; all
their leaders are rebellious.
16Ephraim is blighted, their root is
withered, they yield no fruit. Even if they
bear children, I will slay their cherished
offspring."
17My God will reject them because they
have not obeyed him; they will be
wanderers among the nations.
10Israel was a spreading vine; he
brought forth fruit for himself. As his fruit
increased, he built more altars; as his
land prospered, he adorned his sacred
stones.
2Their heart is deceitful, and now they
must bear their guilt. The Lord will
demolish their altars and destroy their
sacred stones.
3Then they will say, "We have no king
because we did not revere the Lord .
But even if we had a king, what could he
do for us?"
4They make many promises, take false
oaths and make agreements; therefore
lawsuits spring up like poisonous weeds
in a plowed field.
5The people who live in Samaria fear for
the calf-idol of Beth Aven. Its people will
mourn over it, and so will its idolatrous
priests, those who had rejoiced over its
splendor, because it is taken from them
into exile.
6It will be carried to Assyria as tribute for
the great king. Ephraim will be
disgraced; Israel will be ashamed of its
wooden idols.
7Samaria and its king will float away like
a twig on the surface of the waters.
8The high places of wickedness will be
destroyed- it is the sin of Israel. Thorns
and thistles will grow up and cover their
altars. Then they will say to the
mountains, "Cover us!" and to the hills,
"Fall on us!"
9"Since the days of Gibeah, you have
sinned, O Israel, and there you have
remained. Did not war overtake the
evildoers in Gibeah?
10When I please, I will punish them;
nations will be gathered against them to
put them in bonds for their double sin.
11Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves
to thresh; so I will put a yoke on her fair
neck. I will drive Ephraim, Judah must
plow, and Jacob must break up the
ground.
12Sow for yourselves righteousness,
reap the fruit of unfailing love, and break
up your unplowed ground; for it is time
to seek the Lord , until he comes and
showers righteousness on you.
13But you have planted wickedness, you
have reaped evil, you have eaten the
fruit of deception. Because you have
depended on your own strength and on
your many warriors,
14the roar of battle will rise against your
people, so that all your fortresses will be
devastated- as Shalman devastated
Beth Arbel on the day of battle, when
mothers were dashed to the ground with
their children.
15Thus will it happen to you, O Bethel,
because your wickedness is great.
When that day dawns, the king of Israel
will be completely destroyed.
11"When Israel was a child, I loved
him, and out of Egypt I called my son.
2But the more I called Israel, the further
they went from me. They sacrificed to
the Baals and they burned incense to
images.
3It was I who taught Ephraim to walk,
taking them by the arms; but they did
not realize it was I who healed them.
4I led them with cords of human
kindness, with ties of love; I lifted the
yoke from their neck and bent down to
feed them.
5"Will they not return to Egypt and will
not Assyria rule over them because they
refuse to repent?
6Swords will flash in their cities, will
destroy the bars of their gates and put
an end to their plans.
7My people are determined to turn from
me. Even if they call to the Most High,
he will by no means exalt them.
8"How can I give you up, Ephraim? How
can I hand you over, Israel? How can I
treat you like Admah? How can I make
you like Zeboiim? My heart is changed
within me; all my compassion is aroused.
9I will not carry out my fierce anger, nor
will I turn and devastate Ephraim. For I
am God, and not man- the Holy One
among you. I will not come in wrath.
10They will follow the Lord ; he will roar
like a lion. When he roars, his children
will come trembling from the west.
11They will come trembling like birds
from Egypt, like doves from Assyria. I
will settle them in their homes," declares
the Lord .
12Ephraim has surrounded me with lies,
the house of Israel with deceit. And
Judah is unruly against God, even
against the faithful Holy One.
12Ephraim feeds on the wind; he
pursues the east wind all day and
multiplies lies and violence. He makes a
treaty with Assyria and sends olive oil to
Egypt.
2The Lord has a charge to bring against
Judah; he will punish Jacob according to
his ways and repay him according to his
deeds.
3In the womb he grasped his brother's
heel; as a man he struggled with God.
4He struggled with the angel and
overcame him; he wept and begged for
his favor. He found him at Bethel and
talked with him there-
5the Lord God Almighty, the Lord is his
name of renown!
6But you must return to your God;
maintain love and justice, and wait for
your God always.
7The merchant uses dishonest scales;
he loves to defraud.
8Ephraim boasts, "I am very rich; I have
become wealthy. With all my wealth
they will not find in me any iniquity or
sin."
9"I am the Lord your God, who brought
you out of Egypt; I will make you live in
tents again, as in the days of your
appointed feasts.
10I spoke to the prophets, gave them
many visions and told parables through
them."
11Is Gilead wicked? Its people are
worthless! Do they sacrifice bulls in
Gilgal? Their altars will be like piles of
stones on a plowed field.
12Jacob fled to the country of Aram ;
Israel served to get a wife, and to pay
for her he tended sheep.
13The Lord used a prophet to bring
Israel up from Egypt, by a prophet he
cared for him.
14But Ephraim has bitterly provoked him
to anger; his Lord will leave upon him
the guilt of his bloodshed and will repay
him for his contempt.
13When Ephraim spoke, men
trembled; he was exalted in Israel. But
he became guilty of Baal worship and
died.
2Now they sin more and more; they
make idols for themselves from their
silver, cleverly fashioned images, all of
them the work of craftsmen. It is said of
these people, "They offer human
sacrifice and kiss the calf-idols."
3Therefore they will be like the morning
mist, like the early dew that disappears,
like chaff swirling from a threshing floor,
like smoke escaping through a window.
4"But I am the Lord your God, who
brought you out of Egypt. You shall
acknowledge no God but me, no Savior
except me.
5I cared for you in the desert, in the land
of burning heat.
6When I fed them, they were satisfied;
when they were satisfied, they became
proud; then they forgot me.
7So I will come upon them like a lion,
like a leopard I will lurk by the path.
8Like a bear robbed of her cubs, I will
attack them and rip them open. Like a
lion I will devour them; a wild animal will
tear them apart.
9"You are destroyed, O Israel, because
you are against me, against your helper.
10Where is your king, that he may save
you? Where are your rulers in all your
towns, of whom you said, 'Give me a
king and princes'?
11So in my anger I gave you a king, and
in my wrath I took him away.
12The guilt of Ephraim is stored up, his
sins are kept on record.
13Pains as of a woman in childbirth
come to him, but he is a child without
wisdom; when the time arrives, he does
not come to the opening of the womb.
14"I will ransom them from the power of
the grave ; I will redeem them from
death. Where, O death, are your
plagues? Where, O grave, is your
destruction? "I will have no compassion,
15even though he thrives among his
brothers. An east wind from the Lord will
come, blowing in from the desert; his
spring will fail and his well dry up. His
storehouse will be plundered of all its
treasures.
16The people of Samaria must bear their
guilt, because they have rebelled
against their God. They will fall by the
sword; their little ones will be dashed to
the ground, their pregnant women
ripped open."
14Return, O Israel, to the Lord your
God. Your sins have been your
downfall!
2Take words with you and return to the
Lord . Say to him: "Forgive all our sins
and receive us graciously, that we may
offer the fruit of our lips.
3Assyria cannot save us; we will not
mount war-horses. We will never again
say 'Our gods' to what our own hands
have made, for in you the fatherless find
compassion."
4"I will heal their waywardness and love
them freely, for my anger has turned
away from them.
5I will be like the dew to Israel; he will
blossom like a lily. Like a cedar of
Lebanon he will send down his roots;
6his young shoots will grow. His
splendor will be like an olive tree, his
fragrance like a cedar of Lebanon.
7Men will dwell again in his shade. He
will flourish like the grain. He will
blossom like a vine, and his fame will be
like the wine from Lebanon.
8O Ephraim, what more have I to do with
idols? I will answer him and care for him.
I am like a green pine tree; your
fruitfulness comes from me."
9Who is wise? He will realize these
things. Who is discerning? He will
understand them. The ways of the Lord
are right; the righteous walk in them, but
the rebellious stumble in them.
Joel
1The word of the Lord that came to
Joel son of Pethuel.
2Hear this, you elders; listen, all who live
in the land. Has anything like this ever
happened in your days or in the days of
your forefathers?
3Tell it to your children, and let your
children tell it to their children, and their
children to the next generation.
4What the locust swarm has left the
great locusts have eaten; what the great
locusts have left the young locusts have
eaten; what the young locusts have left
other locusts have eaten.
5Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!
Wail, all you drinkers of wine; wail
because of the new wine, for it has been
snatched from your lips.
6A nation has invaded my land, powerful
and without number; it has the teeth of a
lion, the fangs of a lioness.
7It has laid waste my vines and ruined
my fig trees. It has stripped off their bark
and thrown it away, leaving their
branches white.
8Mourn like a virgin in sackcloth grieving
for the husband of her youth.
9Grain offerings and drink offerings are
cut off from the house of the Lord . The
priests are in mourning, those who
minister before the Lord .
10The fields are ruined, the ground is
dried up ; the grain is destroyed, the
new wine is dried up, the oil fails.
11Despair, you farmers, wail, you vine
growers; grieve for the wheat and the
barley, because the harvest of the field
is destroyed.
12The vine is dried up and the fig tree is
withered; the pomegranate, the palm
and the apple tree- all the trees of the
field-are dried up. Surely the joy of
mankind is withered away.
13Put on sackcloth, O priests, and
mourn; wail, you who minister before the
altar. Come, spend the night in
sackcloth, you who minister before my
God; for the grain offerings and drink
offerings are withheld from the house of
your God.
14Declare a holy fast; call a sacred
assembly. Summon the elders and all
who live in the land to the house of the
Lord your God, and cry out to the Lord .
15Alas for that day! For the day of the
Lord is near; it will come like destruction
from the Almighty.
16Has not the food been cut off before
our very eyes- joy and gladness from
the house of our God?
17The seeds are shriveled beneath the
clods. The storehouses are in ruins, the
granaries have been broken down, for
the grain has dried up.
18How the cattle moan! The herds mill
about because they have no pasture;
even the flocks of sheep are suffering.
19To you, O Lord , I call, for fire has
devoured the open pastures and flames
have burned up all the trees of the field.
20Even the wild animals pant for you; the
streams of water have dried up and fire
has devoured the open pastures.
2Blow the trumpet in Zion; sound the
alarm on my holy hill. Let all who live in
the land tremble, for the day of the Lord
is coming. It is close at hand-
2a day of darkness and gloom, a day of
clouds and blackness. Like dawn
spreading across the mountains a large
and mighty army comes, such as never
was of old nor ever will be in ages to
come.
3Before them fire devours, behind them
a flame blazes. Before them the land is
like the garden of Eden, behind them, a
desert waste- nothing escapes them.
4They have the appearance of horses;
they gallop along like cavalry.
5With a noise like that of chariots they
leap over the mountaintops, like a
crackling fire consuming stubble, like a
mighty army drawn up for battle.
6At the sight of them, nations are in
anguish; every face turns pale.
7They charge like warriors; they scale
walls like soldiers. They all march in line,
not swerving from their course.
8They do not jostle each other; each
marches straight ahead. They plunge
through defenses without breaking
ranks.
9They rush upon the city; they run along
the wall. They climb into the houses; like
thieves they enter through the windows.
10Before them the earth shakes, the sky
trembles, the sun and moon are
darkened, and the stars no longer shine.
11The Lord thunders at the head of his
army; his forces are beyond number,
and mighty are those who obey his
command. The day of the Lord is great;
it is dreadful. Who can endure it?
12"Even now," declares the Lord , "return
to me with all your heart, with fasting
and weeping and mourning."
13Rend your heart and not your
garments. Return to the Lord your God,
for he is gracious and compassionate,
slow to anger and abounding in love,
and he relents from sending calamity.
14Who knows? He may turn and have
pity and leave behind a blessing- grain
offerings and drink offerings for the Lord
your God.
15Blow the trumpet in Zion, declare a
holy fast, call a sacred assembly.
16Gather the people, consecrate the
assembly; bring together the elders,
gather the children, those nursing at the
breast. Let the bridegroom leave his
room and the bride her chamber.
17Let the priests, who minister before the
Lord , weep between the temple porch
and the altar. Let them say, "Spare your
people, O Lord . Do not make your
inheritance an object of scorn, a byword
among the nations. Why should they
say among the peoples, 'Where is their
God?' "
18Then the Lord will be jealous for his
land and take pity on his people.
19The Lord will reply to them: "I am
sending you grain, new wine and oil,
enough to satisfy you fully; never again
will I make you an object of scorn to the
nations.
20"I will drive the northern army far from
you, pushing it into a parched and
barren land, with its front columns going
into the eastern sea and those in the
rear into the western sea. And its stench
will go up; its smell will rise." Surely he
has done great things.
21Be not afraid, O land; be glad and
rejoice. Surely the Lord has done great
things.
22Be not afraid, O wild animals, for the
open pastures are becoming green. The
trees are bearing their fruit; the fig tree
and the vine yield their riches.
23Be glad, O people of Zion, rejoice in
the Lord your God, for he has given you
the autumn rains in righteousness. He
sends you abundant showers, both
autumn and spring rains, as before.
24The threshing floors will be filled with
grain; the vats will overflow with new
wine and oil.
25"I will repay you for the years the
locusts have eaten- the great locust and
the young locust, the other locusts and
the locust swarm - my great army that I
sent among you.
26You will have plenty to eat, until you
are full, and you will praise the name of
the Lord your God, who has worked
wonders for you; never again will my
people be shamed.
27Then you will know that I am in Israel,
that I am the Lord your God, and that
there is no other; never again will my
people be shamed.
28"And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit
on all people. Your sons and daughters
will prophesy, your old men will dream
dreams, your young men will see visions.
29Even on my servants, both men and
women, I will pour out my Spirit in those
days.
30I will show wonders in the heavens
and on the earth, blood and fire and
billows of smoke.
31The sun will be turned to darkness and
the moon to blood before the coming of
the great and dreadful day of the Lord .
32And everyone who calls on the name
of the Lord will be saved; for on Mount
Zion and in Jerusalem there will be
deliverance, as the Lord has said,
among the survivors whom the Lord
calls.
3"In those days and at that time, when
I restore the fortunes of Judah and
Jerusalem,
2I will gather all nations and bring them
down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.
There I will enter into judgment against
them concerning my inheritance, my
people Israel, for they scattered my
people among the nations and divided
up my land.
3They cast lots for my people and traded
boys for prostitutes; they sold girls for
wine that they might drink.
4"Now what have you against me, O
Tyre and Sidon and all you regions of
Philistia? Are you repaying me for
something I have done? If you are
paying me back, I will swiftly and
speedily return on your own heads what
you have done.
5For you took my silver and my gold and
carried off my finest treasures to your
temples.
6You sold the people of Judah and
Jerusalem to the Greeks, that you might
send them far from their homeland.
7"See, I am going to rouse them out of
the places to which you sold them, and I
will return on your own heads what you
have done.
8I will sell your sons and daughters to
the people of Judah, and they will sell
them to the Sabeans, a nation far
away." The Lord has spoken.
9Proclaim this among the nations:
Prepare for war! Rouse the warriors! Let
all the fighting men draw near and
attack.
10Beat your plowshares into swords and
your pruning hooks into spears. Let the
weakling say, "I am strong!"
11Come quickly, all you nations from
every side, and assemble there. Bring
down your warriors, O Lord !
12"Let the nations be roused; let them
advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
for there I will sit to judge all the nations
on every side.
13Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe.
Come, trample the grapes, for the
winepress is full and the vats overflowso
great is their wickedness!"
14Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of
decision! For the day of the Lord is near
in the valley of decision.
15The sun and moon will be darkened,
and the stars no longer shine.
16The Lord will roar from Zion and
thunder from Jerusalem; the earth and
the sky will tremble. But the Lord will be
a refuge for his people, a stronghold for
the people of Israel.
17"Then you will know that I, the Lord
your God, dwell in Zion, my holy hill.
Jerusalem will be holy; never again will
foreigners invade her.
18"In that day the mountains will drip
new wine, and the hills will flow with
milk; all the ravines of Judah will run
with water. A fountain will flow out of the
Lord 's house and will water the valley of
acacias.
19But Egypt will be desolate, Edom a
desert waste, because of violence done
to the people of Judah, in whose land
they shed innocent blood.
20Judah will be inhabited forever and
Jerusalem through all generations.
21Their bloodguilt, which I have not
pardoned, I will pardon." The Lord
dwells in Zion!
Amos
1The words of Amos, one of the
shepherds of Tekoa-what he saw
concerning Israel two years before the
earthquake, when Uzziah was king of
Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash
was king of Israel.
2He said: "The Lord roars from Zion and
thunders from Jerusalem; the pastures
of the shepherds dry up, and the top of
Carmel withers."
3This is what the Lord says: "For three
sins of Damascus, even for four, I will
not turn back my wrath . Because she
threshed Gilead with sledges having
iron teeth,
4I will send fire upon the house of
Hazael that will consume the fortresses
of Ben-Hadad.
5I will break down the gate of
Damascus; I will destroy the king who is
in the Valley of Aven and the one who
holds the scepter in Beth Eden. The
people of Aram will go into exile to Kir,"
says the Lord .
6This is what the Lord says: "For three
sins of Gaza, even for four, I will not turn
back my wrath . Because she took
captive whole communities and sold
them to Edom,
7I will send fire upon the walls of Gaza
that will consume her fortresses.
8I will destroy the king of Ashdod and
the one who holds the scepter in
Ashkelon. I will turn my hand against
Ekron, till the last of the Philistines is
dead," says the Sovereign Lord .
9This is what the Lord says: "For three
sins of Tyre, even for four, I will not turn
back my wrath . Because she sold
whole communities of captives to Edom,
disregarding a treaty of brotherhood,
10I will send fire upon the walls of Tyre
that will consume her fortresses."
11This is what the Lord says: "For three
sins of Edom, even for four, I will not
turn back my wrath . Because he
pursued his brother with a sword, stifling
all compassion, because his anger
raged continually and his fury flamed
unchecked,
12I will send fire upon Teman that will
consume the fortresses of Bozrah."
13This is what the Lord says: "For three
sins of Ammon, even for four, I will not
turn back [my wrath]. Because he ripped
open the pregnant women of Gilead in
order to extend his borders,
14I will set fire to the walls of Rabbah
that will consume her fortresses amid
war cries on the day of battle, amid
violent winds on a stormy day.
15Her king will go into exile, he and his
officials together," says the Lord .
2This is what the Lord says: "For three
sins of Moab, even for four, I will not
turn back [my wrath]. Because he
burned, as if to lime, the bones of
Edom's king,
2I will send fire upon Moab that will
consume the fortresses of Kerioth.
Moab will go down in great tumult amid
war cries and the blast of the trumpet.
3I will destroy her ruler and kill all her
officials with him," says the Lord .
4This is what the Lord says: "For three
sins of Judah, even for four, I will not
turn back [my wrath]. Because they
have rejected the law of the Lord and
have not kept his decrees, because they
have been led astray by false gods, the
gods their ancestors followed,
5I will send fire upon Judah that will
consume the fortresses of Jerusalem."
6This is what the Lord says: "For three
sins of Israel, even for four, I will not turn
back [my wrath]. They sell the righteous
for silver, and the needy for a pair of
sandals.
7They trample on the heads of the poor
as upon the dust of the ground and deny
justice to the oppressed. Father and son
use the same girl and so profane my
holy name.
8They lie down beside every altar on
garments taken in pledge. In the house
of their god they drink wine taken as
fines.
9"I destroyed the Amorite before them,
though he was tall as the cedars and
strong as the oaks. I destroyed his fruit
above and his roots below.
10"I brought you up out of Egypt, and I
led you forty years in the desert to give
you the land of the Amorites.
11I also raised up prophets from among
your sons and Nazirites from among
your young men. Is this not true, people
of Israel?" declares the Lord .
12"But you made the Nazirites drink wine
and commanded the prophets not to
prophesy.
13"Now then, I will crush you as a cart
crushes when loaded with grain.
14The swift will not escape, the strong
will not muster their strength, and the
warrior will not save his life.
15The archer will not stand his ground,
the fleet-footed soldier will not get away,
and the horseman will not save his life.
16Even the bravest warriors will flee
naked on that day," declares the Lord .
3Hear this word the Lord has spoken
against you, O people of Israel-against
the whole family I brought up out of
Egypt:
2"You only have I chosen of all the
families of the earth; therefore I will
punish you for all your sins."
3Do two walk together unless they have
agreed to do so?
4Does a lion roar in the thicket when he
has no prey? Does he growl in his den
when he has caught nothing?
5Does a bird fall into a trap on the
ground where no snare has been set?
Does a trap spring up from the earth
when there is nothing to catch?
6When a trumpet sounds in a city, do not
the people tremble? When disaster
comes to a city, has not the Lord caused
it?
7Surely the Sovereign Lord does nothing
without revealing his plan to his servants
the prophets.
8The lion has roared- who will not fear?
The Sovereign Lord has spoken- who
can but prophesy?
9Proclaim to the fortresses of Ashdod
and to the fortresses of Egypt:
"Assemble yourselves on the mountains
of Samaria; see the great unrest within
her and the oppression among her
people."
10"They do not know how to do right,"
declares the Lord , "who hoard plunder
and loot in their fortresses."
11Therefore this is what the Sovereign
Lord says: "An enemy will overrun the
land; he will pull down your strongholds
and plunder your fortresses."
12This is what the Lord says: "As a
shepherd saves from the lion's mouth
only two leg bones or a piece of an ear,
so will the Israelites be saved, those
who sit in Samaria on the edge of their
beds and in Damascus on their couches.
"
13"Hear this and testify against the
house of Jacob," declares the Lord, the
Lord God Almighty.
14"On the day I punish Israel for her sins,
I will destroy the altars of Bethel; the
horns of the altar will be cut off and fall
to the ground.
15I will tear down the winter house along
with the summer house; the houses
adorned with ivory will be destroyed and
the mansions will be demolished,"
declares the Lord .
4Hear this word, you cows of Bashan
on Mount Samaria, you women who
oppress the poor and crush the needy
and say to your husbands, "Bring us
some drinks!"
2The Sovereign Lord has sworn by his
holiness: "The time will surely come
when you will be taken away with hooks,
the last of you with fishhooks.
3You will each go straight out through
breaks in the wall, and you will be cast
out toward Harmon, " declares the Lord .
4"Go to Bethel and sin; go to Gilgal and
sin yet more. Bring your sacrifices every
morning, your tithes every three years.
5Burn leavened bread as a thank
offering and brag about your freewill
offerings- boast about them, you
Israelites, for this is what you love to
do," declares the Sovereign Lord .
6"I gave you empty stomachs in every
city and lack of bread in every town, yet
you have not returned to me," declares
the Lord .
7"I also withheld rain from you when the
harvest was still three months away. I
sent rain on one town, but withheld it
from another. One field had rain;
another had none and dried up.
8People staggered from town to town for
water but did not get enough to drink,
yet you have not returned to me,"
declares the Lord .
9"Many times I struck your gardens and
vineyards, I struck them with blight and
mildew. Locusts devoured your fig and
olive trees, yet you have not returned to
me," declares the Lord .
10"I sent plagues among you as I did to
Egypt. I killed your young men with the
sword, along with your captured horses.
I filled your nostrils with the stench of
your camps, yet you have not returned
to me," declares the Lord .
11"I overthrew some of you as I
overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You
were like a burning stick snatched from
the fire, yet you have not returned to
me," declares the Lord .
12"Therefore this is what I will do to you,
Israel, and because I will do this to you,
prepare to meet your God, O Israel."
13He who forms the mountains, creates
the wind, and reveals his thoughts to
man, he who turns dawn to darkness,
and treads the high places of the earththe
Lord God Almighty is his name.
5Hear this word, O house of Israel,
this lament I take up concerning you:
2"Fallen is Virgin Israel, never to rise
again, deserted in her own land, with no
one to lift her up."
3This is what the Sovereign Lord says:
"The city that marches out a thousand
strong for Israel will have only a hundred
left; the town that marches out a
hundred strong will have only ten left."
4This is what the Lord says to the house
of Israel: "Seek me and live;
5do not seek Bethel, do not go to Gilgal,
do not journey to Beersheba. For Gilgal
will surely go into exile, and Bethel will
be reduced to nothing. "
6Seek the Lord and live, or he will sweep
through the house of Joseph like a fire;
it will devour, and Bethel will have no
one to quench it.
7You who turn justice into bitterness and
cast righteousness to the ground
8(he who made the Pleiades and Orion,
who turns blackness into dawn and
darkens day into night, who calls for the
waters of the sea and pours them out
over the face of the land- the Lord is his
name9he
flashes destruction on the
stronghold and brings the fortified city to
ruin),
10you hate the one who reproves in
court and despise him who tells the truth.
11You trample on the poor and force him
to give you grain. Therefore, though you
have built stone mansions, you will not
live in them; though you have planted
lush vineyards, you will not drink their
wine.
12For I know how many are your
offenses and how great your sins. You
oppress the righteous and take bribes
and you deprive the poor of justice in
the courts.
13Therefore the prudent man keeps
quiet in such times, for the times are evil.
14Seek good, not evil, that you may live.
Then the Lord God Almighty will be with
you, just as you say he is.
15Hate evil, love good; maintain justice
in the courts. Perhaps the Lord God
Almighty will have mercy on the remnant
of Joseph.
16Therefore this is what the Lord, the
Lord God Almighty, says: "There will be
wailing in all the streets and cries of
anguish in every public square. The
farmers will be summoned to weep and
the mourners to wail.
17There will be wailing in all the
vineyards, for I will pass through your
midst," says the Lord .
18Woe to you who long for the day of the
Lord ! Why do you long for the day of
the Lord ? That day will be darkness,
not light.
19It will be as though a man fled from a
lion only to meet a bear, as though he
entered his house and rested his hand
on the wall only to have a snake bite
him.
20Will not the day of the Lord be
darkness, not light- pitch-dark, without a
ray of brightness?
21"I hate, I despise your religious feasts;
I cannot stand your assemblies.
22Even though you bring me burnt
offerings and grain offerings, I will not
accept them. Though you bring choice
fellowship offerings, I will have no
regard for them.
23Away with the noise of your songs! I
will not listen to the music of your harps.
24But let justice roll on like a river,
righteousness like a never-failing
stream!
25"Did you bring me sacrifices and
offerings forty years in the desert, O
house of Israel?
26You have lifted up the shrine of your
king, the pedestal of your idols, the star
of your god - which you made for
yourselves.
27Therefore I will send you into exile
beyond Damascus," says the Lord ,
whose name is God Almighty.
6Woe to you who are complacent in
Zion, and to you who feel secure on
Mount Samaria, you notable men of the
foremost nation, to whom the people of
Israel come!
2Go to Calneh and look at it; go from
there to great Hamath, and then go
down to Gath in Philistia. Are they better
off than your two kingdoms? Is their land
larger than yours?
3You put off the evil day and bring near
a reign of terror.
4You lie on beds inlaid with ivory and
lounge on your couches. You dine on
choice lambs and fattened calves.
5You strum away on your harps like
David and improvise on musical
instruments.
6You drink wine by the bowlful and use
the finest lotions, but you do not grieve
over the ruin of Joseph.
7Therefore you will be among the first to
go into exile; your feasting and lounging
will end.
8The Sovereign Lord has sworn by
himself-the Lord God Almighty declares:
"I abhor the pride of Jacob and detest
his fortresses; I will deliver up the city
and everything in it."
9If ten men are left in one house, they
too will die.
10And if a relative who is to burn the
bodies comes to carry them out of the
house and asks anyone still hiding there,
"Is anyone with you?" and he says,
"No," then he will say, "Hush! We must
not mention the name of the Lord ."
11For the Lord has given the command,
and he will smash the great house into
pieces and the small house into bits.
12Do horses run on the rocky crags?
Does one plow there with oxen? But you
have turned justice into poison and the
fruit of righteousness into bitterness-
13you who rejoice in the conquest of Lo
Debar and say, "Did we not take
Karnaim by our own strength?"
14For the Lord God Almighty declares, "I
will stir up a nation against you, O house
of Israel, that will oppress you all the
way from Lebo Hamath to the valley of
the Arabah."
7This is what the Sovereign Lord
showed me: He was preparing swarms
of locusts after the king's share had
been harvested and just as the second
crop was coming up.
2When they had stripped the land clean,
I cried out, "Sovereign Lord , forgive!
How can Jacob survive? He is so small!"
3So the Lord relented. "This will not
happen," the Lord said.
4This is what the Sovereign Lord
showed me: The Sovereign Lord was
calling for judgment by fire; it dried up
the great deep and devoured the land.
5Then I cried out, "Sovereign Lord , I
beg you, stop! How can Jacob survive?
He is so small!"
6So the Lord relented. "This will not
happen either," the Sovereign Lord said.
7This is what he showed me: The Lord
was standing by a wall that had been
built true to plumb, with a plumb line in
his hand.
8And the Lord asked me, "What do you
see, Amos?" "A plumb line," I replied.
Then the Lord said, "Look, I am setting a
plumb line among my people Israel; I
will spare them no longer.
9"The high places of Isaac will be
destroyed and the sanctuaries of Israel
will be ruined; with my sword I will rise
against the house of Jeroboam."
10Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent
a message to Jeroboam king of Israel:
"Amos is raising a conspiracy against
you in the very heart of Israel. The land
cannot bear all his words.
11For this is what Amos is saying: "
'Jeroboam will die by the sword, and
Israel will surely go into exile, away from
their native land.' "
12Then Amaziah said to Amos, "Get out,
you seer! Go back to the land of Judah.
Earn your bread there and do your
prophesying there.
13Don't prophesy anymore at Bethel,
because this is the king's sanctuary and
the temple of the kingdom."
14Amos answered Amaziah, "I was
neither a prophet nor a prophet's son,
but I was a shepherd, and I also took
care of sycamore-fig trees.
15But the Lord took me from tending the
flock and said to me, 'Go, prophesy to
my people Israel.'
16Now then, hear the word of the Lord .
You say, " 'Do not prophesy against
Israel, and stop preaching against the
house of Isaac.'
17"Therefore this is what the Lord says: "
'Your wife will become a prostitute in the
city, and your sons and daughters will
fall by the sword. Your land will be
measured and divided up, and you
yourself will die in a pagan country. And
Israel will certainly go into exile, away
from their native land.' "
8This is what the Sovereign Lord
showed me: a basket of ripe fruit.
2"What do you see, Amos?" he asked.
"A basket of ripe fruit," I answered. Then
the Lord said to me, "The time is ripe for
my people Israel; I will spare them no
longer.
3"In that day," declares the Sovereign
Lord , "the songs in the temple will turn
to wailing. Many, many bodies-flung
everywhere! Silence!"
4Hear this, you who trample the needy
and do away with the poor of the land,
5saying, "When will the New Moon be
over that we may sell grain, and the
Sabbath be ended that we may market
wheat?"- skimping the measure,
boosting the price and cheating with
dishonest scales,
6buying the poor with silver and the
needy for a pair of sandals, selling even
the sweepings with the wheat.
7The Lord has sworn by the Pride of
Jacob: "I will never forget anything they
have done.
8"Will not the land tremble for this, and
all who live in it mourn? The whole land
will rise like the Nile; it will be stirred up
and then sink like the river of Egypt.
9"In that day," declares the Sovereign
Lord , "I will make the sun go down at
noon and darken the earth in broad
daylight.
10I will turn your religious feasts into
mourning and all your singing into
weeping. I will make all of you wear
sackcloth and shave your heads. I will
make that time like mourning for an only
son and the end of it like a bitter day.
11"The days are coming," declares the
Sovereign Lord , "when I will send a
famine through the land- not a famine of
food or a thirst for water, but a famine of
hearing the words of the Lord .
12Men will stagger from sea to sea and
wander from north to east, searching for
the word of the Lord , but they will not
find it.
13"In that day "the lovely young women
and strong young men will faint because
of thirst.
14They who swear by the shame of
Samaria, or say, 'As surely as your god
lives, O Dan,' or, 'As surely as the god
of Beersheba lives'- they will fall, never
to rise again."
9I saw the Lord standing by the altar,
and he said: "Strike the tops of the
pillars so that the thresholds shake.
Bring them down on the heads of all the
people; those who are left I will kill with
the sword. Not one will get away, none
will escape.
2Though they dig down to the depths of
the grave, from there my hand will take
them. Though they climb up to the
heavens, from there I will bring them
down.
3Though they hide themselves on the
top of Carmel, there I will hunt them
down and seize them. Though they hide
from me at the bottom of the sea, there I
will command the serpent to bite them.
4Though they are driven into exile by
their enemies, there I will command the
sword to slay them. I will fix my eyes
upon them for evil and not for good."
5The Lord, the Lord Almighty, he who
touches the earth and it melts, and all
who live in it mourn- the whole land
rises like the Nile, then sinks like the
river of Egypt6he
who builds his lofty palace in the
heavens and sets its foundation on the
earth, who calls for the waters of the sea
and pours them out over the face of the
land- the Lord is his name.
7"Are not you Israelites the same to me
as the Cushites ?" declares the Lord .
"Did I not bring Israel up from Egypt, the
Philistines from Caphtor and the
Arameans from Kir?
8"Surely the eyes of the Sovereign Lord
are on the sinful kingdom. I will destroy
it from the face of the earth- yet I will not
totally destroy the house of Jacob,"
declares the Lord .
9"For I will give the command, and I will
shake the house of Israel among all the
nations as grain is shaken in a sieve,
and not a pebble will reach the ground.
10All the sinners among my people will
die by the sword, all those who say,
'Disaster will not overtake or meet us.'
11"In that day I will restore David's fallen
tent. I will repair its broken places,
restore its ruins, and build it as it used to
be,
12so that they may possess the remnant
of Edom and all the nations that bear my
name, " declares the Lord , who will do
these things.
13"The days are coming," declares the
Lord , "when the reaper will be
overtaken by the plowman and the
planter by the one treading grapes. New
wine will drip from the mountains and
flow from all the hills.
14I will bring back my exiled people
Israel; they will rebuild the ruined cities
and live in them. They will plant
vineyards and drink their wine; they will
make gardens and eat their fruit.
15I will plant Israel in their own land,
never again to be uprooted from the
land I have given them," says the Lord
your God.
Obadiah
1The vision of Obadiah. This is what
the Sovereign Lord says about Edom-
We have heard a message from the
Lord : An envoy was sent to the nations
to say, "Rise, and let us go against her
for battle"-
2"See, I will make you small among the
nations; you will be utterly despised.
3The pride of your heart has deceived
you, you who live in the clefts of the
rocks and make your home on the
heights, you who say to yourself, 'Who
can bring me down to the ground?'
4Though you soar like the eagle and
make your nest among the stars, from
there I will bring you down," declares the
Lord.
5"If thieves came to you, if robbers in the
night- Oh, what a disaster awaits youwould
they not steal only as much as
they wanted? If grape pickers came to
you, would they not leave a few grapes?
6But how Esau will be ransacked, his
hidden treasures pillaged!
7All your allies will force you to the
border; your friends will deceive and
overpower you; those who eat your
bread will set a trap for you, but you will
not detect it.
8"In that day," declares the Lord , "will I
not destroy the wise men of Edom, men
of understanding in the mountains of
Esau?
9Your warriors, O Teman, will be terrified,
and everyone in Esau's mountains will
be cut down in the slaughter.
10Because of the violence against your
brother Jacob, you will be covered with
shame; you will be destroyed forever.
11On the day you stood aloof while
strangers carried off his wealth and
foreigners entered his gates and cast
lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of
them.
12You should not look down on your
brother in the day of his misfortune, nor
rejoice over the people of Judah in the
day of their destruction, nor boast so
much in the day of their trouble.
13You should not march through the
gates of my people in the day of their
disaster, nor look down on them in their
calamity in the day of their disaster, nor
seize their wealth in the day of their
disaster.
14You should not wait at the crossroads
to cut down their fugitives, nor hand
over their survivors in the day of their
trouble.
15"The day of the Lord is near for all
nations. As you have done, it will be
done to you; your deeds will return upon
your own head.
16Just as you drank on my holy hill, so
all the nations will drink continually; they
will drink and drink and be as if they had
never been.
17But on Mount Zion will be deliverance;
it will be holy, and the house of Jacob
will possess its inheritance.
18The house of Jacob will be a fire and
the house of Joseph a flame; the house
of Esau will be stubble, and they will set
it on fire and consume it. There will be
no survivors from the house of Esau."
The Lord has spoken.
19People from the Negev will occupy the
mountains of Esau, and people from the
foothills will possess the land of the
Philistines. They will occupy the fields of
Ephraim and Samaria, and Benjamin
will possess Gilead.
20This company of Israelite exiles who
are in Canaan will possess the land as
far as Zarephath; the exiles from
Jerusalem who are in Sepharad will
possess the towns of the Negev.
21Deliverers will go up on Mount Zion to
govern the mountains of Esau. And the
kingdom will be the Lord's.
Jonah
1The word of the Lord came to Jonah
son of Amittai:
2"Go to the great city of Nineveh and
preach against it, because its
wickedness has come up before me."
3But Jonah ran away from the Lord and
headed for Tarshish. He went down to
Joppa, where he found a ship bound for
that port. After paying the fare, he went
aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee
from the Lord .
4Then the Lord sent a great wind on the
sea, and such a violent storm arose that
the ship threatened to break up.
5All the sailors were afraid and each
cried out to his own god. And they threw
the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship.
But Jonah had gone below deck, where
he lay down and fell into a deep sleep.
6The captain went to him and said, "How
can you sleep? Get up and call on your
god! Maybe he will take notice of us,
and we will not perish."
7Then the sailors said to each other,
"Come, let us cast lots to find out who is
responsible for this calamity." They cast
lots and the lot fell on Jonah.
8So they asked him, "Tell us, who is
responsible for making all this trouble for
us? What do you do? Where do you
come from? What is your country? From
what people are you?"
9He answered, "I am a Hebrew and I
worship the Lord , the God of heaven,
who made the sea and the land."
10This terrified them and they asked,
"What have you done?" (They knew he
was running away from the Lord ,
because he had already told them so.)
11The sea was getting rougher and
rougher. So they asked him, "What
should we do to you to make the sea
calm down for us?"
12"Pick me up and throw me into the
sea," he replied, "and it will become
calm. I know that it is my fault that this
great storm has come upon you."
13Instead, the men did their best to row
back to land. But they could not, for the
sea grew even wilder than before.
14Then they cried to the Lord , "O Lord ,
please do not let us die for taking this
man's life. Do not hold us accountable
for killing an innocent man, for you, O
Lord , have done as you pleased."
15Then they took Jonah and threw him
overboard, and the raging sea grew
calm.
16At this the men greatly feared the
Lord , and they offered a sacrifice to the
Lord and made vows to him.
17But the Lord provided a great fish to
swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside
the fish three days and three nights.
2From inside the fish Jonah prayed to
the Lord his God.
2He said: "In my distress I called to the
Lord , and he answered me. From the
depths of the grave I called for help, and
you listened to my cry.
3You hurled me into the deep, into the
very heart of the seas, and the currents
swirled about me; all your waves and
breakers swept over me.
4I said, 'I have been banished from your
sight; yet I will look again toward your
holy temple.'
5The engulfing waters threatened me,
the deep surrounded me; seaweed was
wrapped around my head.
6To the roots of the mountains I sank
down; the earth beneath barred me in
forever. But you brought my life up from
the pit, O Lord my God.
7"When my life was ebbing away, I
remembered you, Lord , and my prayer
rose to you, to your holy temple.
8"Those who cling to worthless idols
forfeit the grace that could be theirs.
9But I, with a song of thanksgiving, will
sacrifice to you. What I have vowed I will
make good. Salvation comes from the
Lord ."
10And the Lord commanded the fish, and
it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
3Then the word of the Lord came to
Jonah a second time:
2"Go to the great city of Nineveh and
proclaim to it the message I give you."
3Jonah obeyed the word of the Lord and
went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a
very important city-a visit required three
days.
4On the first day, Jonah started into the
city. He proclaimed: "Forty more days
and Nineveh will be overturned."
5The Ninevites believed God. They
declared a fast, and all of them, from the
greatest to the least, put on sackcloth.
6When the news reached the king of
Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took
off his royal robes, covered himself with
sackcloth and sat down in the dust.
7Then he issued a proclamation in
Nineveh: "By the decree of the king and
his nobles: Do not let any man or beast,
herd or flock, taste anything; do not let
them eat or drink.
8But let man and beast be covered with
sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on
God. Let them give up their evil ways
and their violence.
9Who knows? God may yet relent and
with compassion turn from his fierce
anger so that we will not perish."
10When God saw what they did and how
they turned from their evil ways, he had
compassion and did not bring upon
them the destruction he had threatened.
4But Jonah was greatly displeased
and became angry.
2He prayed to the Lord , "O Lord , is this
not what I said when I was still at home?
That is why I was so quick to flee to
Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious
and compassionate God, slow to anger
and abounding in love, a God who
relents from sending calamity.
3Now, O Lord , take away my life, for it is
better for me to die than to live."
4But the Lord replied, "Have you any
right to be angry?"
5Jonah went out and sat down at a place
east of the city. There he made himself
a shelter, sat in its shade and waited to
see what would happen to the city.
6Then the Lord God provided a vine and
made it grow up over Jonah to give
shade for his head to ease his
discomfort, and Jonah was very happy
about the vine.
7But at dawn the next day God provided
a worm, which chewed the vine so that it
withered.
8When the sun rose, God provided a
scorching east wind, and the sun blazed
on Jonah's head so that he grew faint.
He wanted to die, and said, "It would be
better for me to die than to live."
9But God said to Jonah, "Do you have a
right to be angry about the vine?" "I do,"
he said. "I am angry enough to die."
10But the Lord said, "You have been
concerned about this vine, though you
did not tend it or make it grow. It sprang
up overnight and died overnight.
11But Nineveh has more than a hundred
and twenty thousand people who cannot
tell their right hand from their left, and
many cattle as well. Should I not be
concerned about that great city?"
Micah
1The word of the Lord that came to
Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of
Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of
Judah-the vision he saw concerning
Samaria and Jerusalem.
2Hear, O peoples, all of you, listen, O
earth and all who are in it, that the
Sovereign Lord may witness against you,
the Lord from his holy temple.
3Look! The Lord is coming from his
dwelling place; he comes down and
treads the high places of the earth.
4The mountains melt beneath him and
the valleys split apart, like wax before
the fire, like water rushing down a slope.
5All this is because of Jacob's
transgression, because of the sins of the
house of Israel. What is Jacob's
transgression? Is it not Samaria? What
is Judah's high place? Is it not
Jerusalem?
6"Therefore I will make Samaria a heap
of rubble, a place for planting vineyards.
I will pour her stones into the valley and
lay bare her foundations.
7All her idols will be broken to pieces; all
her temple gifts will be burned with fire; I
will destroy all her images. Since she
gathered her gifts from the wages of
prostitutes, as the wages of prostitutes
they will again be used."
8Because of this I will weep and wail; I
will go about barefoot and naked. I will
howl like a jackal and moan like an owl.
9For her wound is incurable; it has come
to Judah. It has reached the very gate of
my people, even to Jerusalem itself.
10Tell it not in Gath ; weep not at all. In
Beth Ophrah roll in the dust.
11Pass on in nakedness and shame, you
who live in Shaphir. Those who live in
Zaanan will not come out. Beth Ezel is
in mourning; its protection is taken from
you.
12Those who live in Maroth writhe in
pain, waiting for relief, because disaster
has come from the Lord , even to the
gate of Jerusalem.
13You who live in Lachish, harness the
team to the chariot. You were the
beginning of sin to the Daughter of Zion,
for the transgressions of Israel were
found in you.
14Therefore you will give parting gifts to
Moresheth Gath. The town of Aczib will
prove deceptive to the kings of Israel.
15I will bring a conqueror against you
who live in Mareshah. He who is the
glory of Israel will come to Adullam.
16Shave your heads in mourning for the
children in whom you delight; make
yourselves as bald as the vulture, for
they will go from you into exile.
2Woe to those who plan iniquity, to
those who plot evil on their beds! At
morning's light they carry it out because
it is in their power to do it.
2They covet fields and seize them, and
houses, and take them. They defraud a
man of his home, a fellowman of his
inheritance.
3Therefore, the Lord says: "I am
planning disaster against this people,
from which you cannot save yourselves.
You will no longer walk proudly, for it will
be a time of calamity.
4In that day men will ridicule you; they
will taunt you with this mournful song:
'We are utterly ruined; my people's
possession is divided up. He takes it
from me! He assigns our fields to
traitors.' "
5Therefore you will have no one in the
assembly of the Lord to divide the land
by lot.
6"Do not prophesy," their prophets say.
"Do not prophesy about these things;
disgrace will not overtake us."
7Should it be said, O house of Jacob: "Is
the Spirit of the Lord angry? Does he do
such things?" "Do not my words do good
to him whose ways are upright?
8Lately my people have risen up like an
enemy. You strip off the rich robe from
those who pass by without a care, like
men returning from battle.
9You drive the women of my people
from their pleasant homes. You take
away my blessing from their children
forever.
10Get up, go away! For this is not your
resting place, because it is defiled, it is
ruined, beyond all remedy.
11If a liar and deceiver comes and says,
'I will prophesy for you plenty of wine
and beer,' he would be just the prophet
for this people!
12"I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob;
I will surely bring together the remnant
of Israel. I will bring them together like
sheep in a pen, like a flock in its
pasture; the place will throng with
people.
13One who breaks open the way will go
up before them; they will break through
the gate and go out. Their king will pass
through before them, the Lord at their
head."
3Then I said, "Listen, you leaders of
Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel.
Should you not know justice,
2you who hate good and love evil; who
tear the skin from my people and the
flesh from their bones;
3who eat my people's flesh, strip off their
skin and break their bones in pieces;
who chop them up like meat for the pan,
like flesh for the pot?"
4Then they will cry out to the Lord , but
he will not answer them. At that time he
will hide his face from them because of
the evil they have done.
5This is what the Lord says: "As for the
prophets who lead my people astray, if
one feeds them, they proclaim 'peace'; if
he does not, they prepare to wage war
against him.
6Therefore night will come over you,
without visions, and darkness, without
divination. The sun will set for the
prophets, and the day will go dark for
them.
7The seers will be ashamed and the
diviners disgraced. They will all cover
their faces because there is no answer
from God."
8But as for me, I am filled with power,
with the Spirit of the Lord , and with
justice and might, to declare to Jacob
his transgression, to Israel his sin.
9Hear this, you leaders of the house of
Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel,
who despise justice and distort all that is
right;
10who build Zion with bloodshed, and
Jerusalem with wickedness.
11Her leaders judge for a bribe, her
priests teach for a price, and her
prophets tell fortunes for money. Yet
they lean upon the Lord and say, "Is not
the Lord among us? No disaster will
come upon us."
12Therefore because of you, Zion will be
plowed like a field, Jerusalem will
become a heap of rubble, the temple hill
a mound overgrown with thickets.
4In the last days the mountain of the
Lord 's temple will be established as
chief among the mountains; it will be
raised above the hills, and peoples will
stream to it.
2Many nations will come and say,
"Come, let us go up to the mountain of
the Lord , to the house of the God of
Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that
we may walk in his paths." The law will
go out from Zion, the word of the Lord
from Jerusalem.
3He will judge between many peoples
and will settle disputes for strong
nations far and wide. They will beat their
swords into plowshares and their spears
into pruning hooks. Nation will not take
up sword against nation, nor will they
train for war anymore.
4Every man will sit under his own vine
and under his own fig tree, and no one
will make them afraid, for the Lord
Almighty has spoken.
5All the nations may walk in the name of
their gods; we will walk in the name of
the Lord our God for ever and ever. The
Lord 's Plan
6"In that day," declares the Lord , "I will
gather the lame; I will assemble the
exiles and those I have brought to grief.
7I will make the lame a remnant, those
driven away a strong nation. The Lord
will rule over them in Mount Zion from
that day and forever.
8As for you, O watchtower of the flock, O
stronghold of the Daughter of Zion, the
former dominion will be restored to you;
kingship will come to the Daughter of
Jerusalem."
9Why do you now cry aloud- have you
no king? Has your counselor perished,
that pain seizes you like that of a
woman in labor?
10Writhe in agony, O Daughter of Zion,
like a woman in labor, for now you must
leave the city to camp in the open field.
You will go to Babylon; there you will be
rescued. There the Lord will redeem you
out of the hand of your enemies.
11But now many nations are gathered
against you. They say, "Let her be
defiled, let our eyes gloat over Zion!"
12But they do not know the thoughts of
the Lord ; they do not understand his
plan, he who gathers them like sheaves
to the threshing floor.
13"Rise and thresh, O Daughter of Zion,
for I will give you horns of iron; I will give
you hoofs of bronze and you will break
to pieces many nations." You will devote
their ill-gotten gains to the Lord , their
wealth to the Lord of all the earth.
5Marshal your troops, O city of troops,
for a siege is laid against us. They will
strike Israel's ruler on the cheek with a
rod.
2"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though
you are small among the clans of Judah,
out of you will come for me one who will
be ruler over Israel, whose origins are
from of old, from ancient times. "
3Therefore Israel will be abandoned until
the time when she who is in labor gives
birth and the rest of his brothers return
to join the Israelites.
4He will stand and shepherd his flock in
the strength of the Lord , in the majesty
of the name of the Lord his God. And
they will live securely, for then his
greatness will reach to the ends of the
earth.
5And he will be their peace. When the
Assyrian invades our land and marches
through our fortresses, we will raise
against him seven shepherds, even
eight leaders of men.
6They will rule the land of Assyria with
the sword, the land of Nimrod with
drawn sword. He will deliver us from the
Assyrian when he invades our land and
marches into our borders.
7The remnant of Jacob will be in the
midst of many peoples like dew from the
Lord , like showers on the grass, which
do not wait for man or linger for mankind.
8The remnant of Jacob will be among
the nations, in the midst of many
peoples, like a lion among the beasts of
the forest, like a young lion among
flocks of sheep, which mauls and
mangles as it goes, and no one can
rescue.
9Your hand will be lifted up in triumph
over your enemies, and all your foes will
be destroyed.
10"In that day," declares the Lord , "I will
destroy your horses from among you
and demolish your chariots.
11I will destroy the cities of your land and
tear down all your strongholds.
12I will destroy your witchcraft and you
will no longer cast spells.
13I will destroy your carved images and
your sacred stones from among you;
you will no longer bow down to the work
of your hands.
14I will uproot from among you your
Asherah poles and demolish your cities.
15I will take vengeance in anger and
wrath upon the nations that have not
obeyed me."
6Listen to what the Lord says: "Stand
up, plead your case before the
mountains; let the hills hear what you
have to say.
2Hear, O mountains, the Lord 's
accusation; listen, you everlasting
foundations of the earth. For the Lord
has a case against his people; he is
lodging a charge against Israel.
3"My people, what have I done to you?
How have I burdened you? Answer me.
4I brought you up out of Egypt and
redeemed you from the land of slavery. I
sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and
Miriam.
5My people, remember what Balak king
of Moab counseled and what Balaam
son of Beor answered. Remember your
journey from Shittim to Gilgal, that you
may know the righteous acts of the
Lord ."
6With what shall I come before the Lord
and bow down before the exalted God?
Shall I come before him with burnt
offerings, with calves a year old?
7Will the Lord be pleased with
thousands of rams, with ten thousand
rivers of oil? Shall I offer my firstborn for
my transgression, the fruit of my body
for the sin of my soul?
8He has showed you, O man, what is
good. And what does the Lord require of
you? To act justly and to love mercy and
to walk humbly with your God.
9Listen! The Lord is calling to the cityand
to fear your name is wisdom- "Heed
the rod and the One who appointed it.
10Am I still to forget, O wicked house,
your ill-gotten treasures and the short
ephah, which is accursed?
11Shall I acquit a man with dishonest
scales, with a bag of false weights?
12Her rich men are violent; her people
are liars and their tongues speak
deceitfully.
13Therefore, I have begun to destroy you,
to ruin you because of your sins.
14You will eat but not be satisfied; your
stomach will still be empty. You will
store up but save nothing, because what
you save I will give to the sword.
15You will plant but not harvest; you will
press olives but not use the oil on
yourselves, you will crush grapes but
not drink the wine.
16You have observed the statutes of
Omri and all the practices of Ahab's
house, and you have followed their
traditions. Therefore I will give you over
to ruin and your people to derision; you
will bear the scorn of the nations. "
7What misery is mine! I am like one
who gathers summer fruit at the
gleaning of the vineyard; there is no
cluster of grapes to eat, none of the
early figs that I crave.
2The godly have been swept from the
land; not one upright man remains. All
men lie in wait to shed blood; each
hunts his brother with a net.
3Both hands are skilled in doing evil; the
ruler demands gifts, the judge accepts
bribes, the powerful dictate what they
desire- they all conspire together.
4The best of them is like a brier, the
most upright worse than a thorn hedge.
The day of your watchmen has come,
the day God visits you. Now is the time
of their confusion.
5Do not trust a neighbor; put no
confidence in a friend. Even with her
who lies in your embrace be careful of
your words.
6For a son dishonors his father, a
daughter rises up against her mother, a
daughter-in-law against her mother-inlaw-
a man's enemies are the members
of his own household.
7But as for me, I watch in hope for the
Lord , I wait for God my Savior; my God
will hear me.
8Do not gloat over me, my enemy!
Though I have fallen, I will rise. Though I
sit in darkness, the Lord will be my light.
9Because I have sinned against him, I
will bear the Lord 's wrath, until he
pleads my case and establishes my
right. He will bring me out into the light; I
will see his righteousness.
10Then my enemy will see it and will be
covered with shame, she who said to
me, "Where is the Lord your God?" My
eyes will see her downfall; even now
she will be trampled underfoot like mire
in the streets.
11The day for building your walls will
come, the day for extending your
boundaries.
12In that day people will come to you
from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,
even from Egypt to the Euphrates and
from sea to sea and from mountain to
mountain.
13The earth will become desolate
because of its inhabitants, as the result
of their deeds.
14Shepherd your people with your staff,
the flock of your inheritance, which lives
by itself in a forest, in fertile
pasturelands. Let them feed in Bashan
and Gilead as in days long ago.
15"As in the days when you came out of
Egypt, I will show them my wonders."
16Nations will see and be ashamed,
deprived of all their power. They will lay
their hands on their mouths and their
ears will become deaf.
17They will lick dust like a snake, like
creatures that crawl on the ground. They
will come trembling out of their dens;
they will turn in fear to the Lord our God
and will be afraid of you.
18Who is a God like you, who pardons
sin and forgives the transgression of the
remnant of his inheritance? You do not
stay angry forever but delight to show
mercy.
19You will again have compassion on us;
you will tread our sins underfoot and
hurl all our iniquities into the depths of
the sea.
20You will be true to Jacob, and show
mercy to Abraham, as you pledged on
oath to our fathers in days long ago.
Nahum
1An oracle concerning Nineveh. The
book of the vision of Nahum the
Elkoshite.
2The Lord is a jealous and avenging
God; the Lord takes vengeance and is
filled with wrath. The Lord takes
vengeance on his foes and maintains
his wrath against his enemies.
3The Lord is slow to anger and great in
power; the Lord will not leave the guilty
unpunished. His way is in the whirlwind
and the storm, and clouds are the dust
of his feet.
4He rebukes the sea and dries it up; he
makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and
Carmel wither and the blossoms of
Lebanon fade.
5The mountains quake before him and
the hills melt away. The earth trembles
at his presence, the world and all who
live in it.
6Who can withstand his indignation?
Who can endure his fierce anger? His
wrath is poured out like fire; the rocks
are shattered before him.
7The Lord is good, a refuge in times of
trouble. He cares for those who trust in
him,
8but with an overwhelming flood he will
make an end of Nineveh ; he will pursue
his foes into darkness.
9Whatever they plot against the Lord he
will bring to an end; trouble will not
come a second time.
10They will be entangled among thorns
and drunk from their wine; they will be
consumed like dry stubble.
11From you, O Nineveh , has one come
forth who plots evil against the Lord and
counsels wickedness.
12This is what the Lord says: "Although
they have allies and are numerous, they
will be cut off and pass away. Although I
have afflicted you, O Judah , I will afflict
you no more.
13Now I will break their yoke from your
neck and tear your shackles away."
14The Lord has given a command
concerning you, Nineveh : "You will
have no descendants to bear your name.
I will destroy the carved images and
cast idols that are in the temple of your
gods. I will prepare your grave, for you
are vile."
15Look, there on the mountains, the feet
of one who brings good news, who
proclaims peace! Celebrate your
festivals, O Judah, and fulfill your vows.
No more will the wicked invade you;
they will be completely destroyed.
2An attacker advances against you,
Nineveh . Guard the fortress, watch the
road, brace yourselves, marshal all your
strength!
2The Lord will restore the splendor of
Jacob like the splendor of Israel, though
destroyers have laid them waste and
have ruined their vines.
3The shields of his soldiers are red; the
warriors are clad in scarlet. The metal
on the chariots flashes on the day they
are made ready; the spears of pine are
brandished.
4The chariots storm through the streets,
rushing back and forth through the
squares. They look like flaming torches;
they dart about like lightning.
5He summons his picked troops, yet
they stumble on their way. They dash to
the city wall; the protective shield is put
in place.
6The river gates are thrown open and
the palace collapses.
7It is decreed that the city be exiled and
carried away. Its slave girls moan like
doves and beat upon their breasts.
8Nineveh is like a pool, and its water is
draining away. "Stop! Stop!" they cry,
but no one turns back.
9Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!
The supply is endless, the wealth from
all its treasures!
10She is pillaged, plundered, stripped!
Hearts melt, knees give way, bodies
tremble, every face grows pale.
11Where now is the lions' den, the place
where they fed their young, where the
lion and lioness went, and the cubs, with
nothing to fear?
12The lion killed enough for his cubs and
strangled the prey for his mate, filling his
lairs with the kill and his dens with the
prey.
13"I am against you," declares the Lord
Almighty. "I will burn up your chariots in
smoke, and the sword will devour your
young lions. I will leave you no prey on
the earth. The voices of your
messengers will no longer be heard."
3Woe to the city of blood, full of lies,
full of plunder, never without victims!
2The crack of whips, the clatter of
wheels, galloping horses and jolting
chariots!
3Charging cavalry, flashing swords and
glittering spears! Many casualties, piles
of dead, bodies without number, people
stumbling over the corpses-
4all because of the wanton lust of a
harlot, alluring, the mistress of sorceries,
who enslaved nations by her prostitution
and peoples by her witchcraft.
5"I am against you," declares the Lord
Almighty. "I will lift your skirts over your
face. I will show the nations your
nakedness and the kingdoms your
shame.
6I will pelt you with filth, I will treat you
with contempt and make you a
spectacle.
7All who see you will flee from you and
say, 'Nineveh is in ruins-who will mourn
for her?' Where can I find anyone to
comfort you?"
8Are you better than Thebes, situated on
the Nile, with water around her? The
river was her defense, the waters her
wall.
9Cush and Egypt were her boundless
strength; Put and Libya were among her
allies.
10Yet she was taken captive and went
into exile. Her infants were dashed to
pieces at the head of every street. Lots
were cast for her nobles, and all her
great men were put in chains.
11You too will become drunk; you will go
into hiding and seek refuge from the
enemy.
12All your fortresses are like fig trees
with their first ripe fruit; when they are
shaken, the figs fall into the mouth of the
eater.
13Look at your troops- they are all
women! The gates of your land are wide
open to your enemies; fire has
consumed their bars.
14Draw water for the siege, strengthen
your defenses! Work the clay, tread the
mortar, repair the brickwork!
15There the fire will devour you; the
sword will cut you down and, like
grasshoppers, consume you. Multiply
like grasshoppers, multiply like locusts!
16You have increased the number of
your merchants till they are more than
the stars of the sky, but like locusts they
strip the land and then fly away.
17Your guards are like locusts, your
officials like swarms of locusts that settle
in the walls on a cold day- but when the
sun appears they fly away, and no one
knows where.
18O king of Assyria, your shepherds
slumber; your nobles lie down to rest.
Your people are scattered on the
mountains with no one to gather them.
19Nothing can heal your wound; your
injury is fatal. Everyone who hears the
news about you claps his hands at your
fall, for who has not felt your endless
cruelty?
Habakkuk
1The oracle that Habakkuk the
prophet received.
2How long, O Lord , must I call for help,
but you do not listen? Or cry out to you,
"Violence!" but you do not save?
3Why do you make me look at injustice?
Why do you tolerate wrong? Destruction
and violence are before me; there is
strife, and conflict abounds.
4Therefore the law is paralyzed, and
justice never prevails. The wicked hem
in the righteous, so that justice is
perverted.
5"Look at the nations and watch- and be
utterly amazed. For I am going to do
something in your days that you would
not believe, even if you were told.
6I am raising up the Babylonians, that
ruthless and impetuous people, who
sweep across the whole earth to seize
dwelling places not their own.
7They are a feared and dreaded people;
they are a law to themselves and
promote their own honor.
8Their horses are swifter than leopards,
fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their
cavalry gallops headlong; their
horsemen come from afar. They fly like
a vulture swooping to devour;
9they all come bent on violence. Their
hordes advance like a desert wind and
gather prisoners like sand.
10They deride kings and scoff at rulers.
They laugh at all fortified cities; they
build earthen ramps and capture them.
11Then they sweep past like the wind
and go on- guilty men, whose own
strength is their god."
12O Lord , are you not from everlasting?
My God, my Holy One, we will not die. O
Lord , you have appointed them to
execute judgment; O Rock, you have
ordained them to punish.
13Your eyes are too pure to look on evil;
you cannot tolerate wrong. Why then do
you tolerate the treacherous? Why are
you silent while the wicked swallow up
those more righteous than themselves?
14You have made men like fish in the
sea, like sea creatures that have no
ruler.
15The wicked foe pulls all of them up
with hooks, he catches them in his net,
he gathers them up in his dragnet; and
so he rejoices and is glad.
16Therefore he sacrifices to his net and
burns incense to his dragnet, for by his
net he lives in luxury and enjoys the
choicest food.
17Is he to keep on emptying his net,
destroying nations without mercy?
2I will stand at my watch and station
myself on the ramparts; I will look to see
what he will say to me, and what answer
I am to give to this complaint.
2Then the Lord replied: "Write down the
revelation and make it plain on tablets
so that a herald may run with it.
3For the revelation awaits an appointed
time; it speaks of the end and will not
prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it
will certainly come and will not delay.
4"See, he is puffed up; his desires are
not upright- but the righteous will live by
his faith -
5indeed, wine betrays him; he is
arrogant and never at rest. Because he
is as greedy as the grave and like death
is never satisfied, he gathers to himself
all the nations and takes captive all the
peoples.
6"Will not all of them taunt him with
ridicule and scorn, saying, " 'Woe to him
who piles up stolen goods and makes
himself wealthy by extortion! How long
must this go on?'
7Will not your debtors suddenly arise?
Will they not wake up and make you
tremble? Then you will become their
victim.
8Because you have plundered many
nations, the peoples who are left will
plunder you. For you have shed man's
blood; you have destroyed lands and
cities and everyone in them.
9"Woe to him who builds his realm by
unjust gain to set his nest on high, to
escape the clutches of ruin!
10You have plotted the ruin of many
peoples, shaming your own house and
forfeiting your life.
11The stones of the wall will cry out, and
the beams of the woodwork will echo it.
12"Woe to him who builds a city with
bloodshed and establishes a town by
crime!
13Has not the Lord Almighty determined
that the people's labor is only fuel for the
fire, that the nations exhaust themselves
for nothing?
14For the earth will be filled with the
knowledge of the glory of the Lord , as
the waters cover the sea.
15"Woe to him who gives drink to his
neighbors, pouring it from the wineskin
till they are drunk, so that he can gaze
on their naked bodies.
16You will be filled with shame instead of
glory. Now it is your turn! Drink and be
exposed ! The cup from the Lord 's right
hand is coming around to you, and
disgrace will cover your glory.
17The violence you have done to
Lebanon will overwhelm you, and your
destruction of animals will terrify you.
For you have shed man's blood; you
have destroyed lands and cities and
everyone in them.
18"Of what value is an idol, since a man
has carved it? Or an image that teaches
lies? For he who makes it trusts in his
own creation; he makes idols that
cannot speak.
19Woe to him who says to wood, 'Come
to life!' Or to lifeless stone, 'Wake up!'
Can it give guidance? It is covered with
gold and silver; there is no breath in it.
20But the Lord is in his holy temple; let
all the earth be silent before him."
3A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet.
On shigionoth .
2Lord , I have heard of your fame; I
stand in awe of your deeds, O Lord .
Renew them in our day, in our time
make them known; in wrath remember
mercy.
3God came from Teman, the Holy One
from Mount Paran. Selah His glory
covered the heavens and his praise
filled the earth.
4His splendor was like the sunrise; rays
flashed from his hand, where his power
was hidden.
5Plague went before him; pestilence
followed his steps.
6He stood, and shook the earth; he
looked, and made the nations tremble.
The ancient mountains crumbled and
the age-old hills collapsed. His ways are
eternal.
7I saw the tents of Cushan in distress,
the dwellings of Midian in anguish.
8Were you angry with the rivers, O
Lord ? Was your wrath against the
streams? Did you rage against the sea
when you rode with your horses and
your victorious chariots?
9You uncovered your bow, you called for
many arrows. Selah You split the earth
with rivers;
10the mountains saw you and writhed.
Torrents of water swept by; the deep
roared and lifted its waves on high.
11Sun and moon stood still in the
heavens at the glint of your flying arrows,
at the lightning of your flashing spear.
12In wrath you strode through the earth
and in anger you threshed the nations.
13You came out to deliver your people,
to save your anointed one. You crushed
the leader of the land of wickedness,
you stripped him from head to foot.
Selah
14With his own spear you pierced his
head when his warriors stormed out to
scatter us, gloating as though about to
devour the wretched who were in hiding.
15You trampled the sea with your horses,
churning the great waters.
16I heard and my heart pounded, my lips
quivered at the sound; decay crept into
my bones, and my legs trembled. Yet I
will wait patiently for the day of calamity
to come on the nation invading us.
17Though the fig tree does not bud and
there are no grapes on the vines,
though the olive crop fails and the fields
produce no food, though there are no
sheep in the pen and no cattle in the
stalls,
18yet I will rejoice in the Lord , I will be
joyful in God my Savior.
19The Sovereign Lord is my strength; he
makes my feet like the feet of a deer, he
enables me to go on the heights. For the
director of music. On my stringed
instruments.
Zephaniah
1The word of the Lord that came to
Zephaniah son of Cushi, the son of
Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of
Hezekiah, during the reign of Josiah son
of Amon king of Judah:
2"I will sweep away everything from the
face of the earth," declares the Lord .
3"I will sweep away both men and
animals; I will sweep away the birds of
the air and the fish of the sea. The
wicked will have only heaps of rubble
when I cut off man from the face of the
earth," declares the Lord .
4"I will stretch out my hand against
Judah and against all who live in
Jerusalem. I will cut off from this place
every remnant of Baal, the names of the
pagan and the idolatrous priests-
5those who bow down on the roofs to
worship the starry host, those who bow
down and swear by the Lord and who
also swear by Molech,
6those who turn back from following the
Lord and neither seek the Lord nor
inquire of him.
7Be silent before the Sovereign Lord ,
for the day of the Lord is near. The Lord
has prepared a sacrifice; he has
consecrated those he has invited.
8On the day of the Lord 's sacrifice I will
punish the princes and the king's sons
and all those clad in foreign clothes.
9On that day I will punish all who avoid
stepping on the threshold, who fill the
temple of their gods with violence and
deceit.
10"On that day," declares the Lord , "a
cry will go up from the Fish Gate, wailing
from the New Quarter, and a loud crash
from the hills.
11Wail, you who live in the market
district ; all your merchants will be wiped
out, all who trade with silver will be
ruined.
12At that time I will search Jerusalem
with lamps and punish those who are
complacent, who are like wine left on its
dregs, who think, 'The Lord will do
nothing, either good or bad.'
13Their wealth will be plundered, their
houses demolished. They will build
houses but not live in them; they will
plant vineyards but not drink the wine.
14"The great day of the Lord is nearnear
and coming quickly. Listen! The cry
on the day of the Lord will be bitter, the
shouting of the warrior there.
15That day will be a day of wrath, a day
of distress and anguish, a day of trouble
and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom,
a day of clouds and blackness,
16a day of trumpet and battle cry against
the fortified cities and against the corner
towers.
17I will bring distress on the people and
they will walk like blind men, because
they have sinned against the Lord .
Their blood will be poured out like dust
and their entrails like filth.
18Neither their silver nor their gold will be
able to save them on the day of the Lord
's wrath. In the fire of his jealousy the
whole world will be consumed, for he
will make a sudden end of all who live in
the earth."
2Gather together, gather together, O
shameful nation,
2before the appointed time arrives and
that day sweeps on like chaff, before the
fierce anger of the Lord comes upon you,
before the day of the Lord 's wrath
comes upon you.
3Seek the Lord , all you humble of the
land, you who do what he commands.
Seek righteousness, seek humility;
perhaps you will be sheltered on the day
of the Lord 's anger.
4Gaza will be abandoned and Ashkelon
left in ruins. At midday Ashdod will be
emptied and Ekron uprooted.
5Woe to you who live by the sea, O
Kerethite people; the word of the Lord is
against you, O Canaan, land of the
Philistines. "I will destroy you, and none
will be left."
6The land by the sea, where the
Kerethites dwell, will be a place for
shepherds and sheep pens.
7It will belong to the remnant of the
house of Judah; there they will find
pasture. In the evening they will lie down
in the houses of Ashkelon. The Lord
their God will care for them; he will
restore their fortunes.
8"I have heard the insults of Moab and
the taunts of the Ammonites, who
insulted my people and made threats
against their land.
9Therefore, as surely as I live," declares
the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel,
"surely Moab will become like Sodom,
the Ammonites like Gomorrah- a place
of weeds and salt pits, a wasteland
forever. The remnant of my people will
plunder them; the survivors of my nation
will inherit their land."
10This is what they will get in return for
their pride, for insulting and mocking the
people of the Lord Almighty.
11The Lord will be awesome to them
when he destroys all the gods of the
land. The nations on every shore will
worship him, every one in its own land.
12"You too, O Cushites, will be slain by
my sword."
13He will stretch out his hand against the
north and destroy Assyria, leaving
Nineveh utterly desolate and dry as the
desert.
14Flocks and herds will lie down there,
creatures of every kind. The desert owl
and the screech owl will roost on her
columns. Their calls will echo through
the windows, rubble will be in the
doorways, the beams of cedar will be
exposed.
15This is the carefree city that lived in
safety. She said to herself, "I am, and
there is none besides me." What a ruin
she has become, a lair for wild beasts!
All who pass by her scoff and shake
their fists.
3Woe to the city of oppressors,
rebellious and defiled!
2She obeys no one, she accepts no
correction. She does not trust in the
Lord , she does not draw near to her
God.
3Her officials are roaring lions, her rulers
are evening wolves, who leave nothing
for the morning.
4Her prophets are arrogant; they are
treacherous men. Her priests profane
the sanctuary and do violence to the law.
5The Lord within her is righteous; he
does no wrong. Morning by morning he
dispenses his justice, and every new
day he does not fail, yet the unrighteous
know no shame.
6"I have cut off nations; their strongholds
are demolished. I have left their streets
deserted, with no one passing through.
Their cities are destroyed; no one will be
left-no one at all.
7I said to the city, 'Surely you will fear
me and accept correction!' Then her
dwelling would not be cut off, nor all my
punishments come upon her. But they
were still eager to act corruptly in all
they did.
8Therefore wait for me," declares the
Lord , "for the day I will stand up to
testify. I have decided to assemble the
nations, to gather the kingdoms and to
pour out my wrath on them- all my fierce
anger. The whole world will be
consumed by the fire of my jealous
anger.
9"Then will I purify the lips of the peoples,
that all of them may call on the name of
the Lord and serve him shoulder to
shoulder.
10From beyond the rivers of Cush my
worshipers, my scattered people, will
bring me offerings.
11On that day you will not be put to
shame for all the wrongs you have done
to me, because I will remove from this
city those who rejoice in their pride.
Never again will you be haughty on my
holy hill.
12But I will leave within you the meek
and humble, who trust in the name of
the Lord .
13The remnant of Israel will do no wrong;
they will speak no lies, nor will deceit be
found in their mouths. They will eat and
lie down and no one will make them
afraid."
14Sing, O Daughter of Zion; shout aloud,
O Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all
your heart, O Daughter of Jerusalem!
15The Lord has taken away your
punishment, he has turned back your
enemy. The Lord , the King of Israel, is
with you; never again will you fear any
harm.
16On that day they will say to Jerusalem,
"Do not fear, O Zion; do not let your
hands hang limp.
17The Lord your God is with you, he is
mighty to save. He will take great delight
in you, he will quiet you with his love, he
will rejoice over you with singing."
18"The sorrows for the appointed feasts I
will remove from you; they are a burden
and a reproach to you.
19At that time I will deal with all who
oppressed you; I will rescue the lame
and gather those who have been
scattered. I will give them praise and
honor in every land where they were put
to shame.
20At that time I will gather you; at that
time I will bring you home. I will give you
honor and praise among all the peoples
of the earth when I restore your fortunes
before your very eyes," says the Lord .
Haggai
1In the second year of King Darius, on
the first day of the sixth month, the word
of the Lord came through the prophet
Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,
governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of
Jehozadak, the high priest:
2This is what the Lord Almighty says:
"These people say, 'The time has not
yet come for the Lord 's house to be
built.' "
3Then the word of the Lord came
through the prophet Haggai:
4"Is it a time for you yourselves to be
living in your paneled houses, while this
house remains a ruin?"
5Now this is what the Lord Almighty
says: "Give careful thought to your ways.
6You have planted much, but have
harvested little. You eat, but never have
enough. You drink, but never have your
fill. You put on clothes, but are not warm.
You earn wages, only to put them in a
purse with holes in it."
7This is what the Lord Almighty says:
"Give careful thought to your ways.
8Go up into the mountains and bring
down timber and build the house, so
that I may take pleasure in it and be
honored," says the Lord .
9"You expected much, but see, it turned
out to be little. What you brought home,
I blew away. Why?" declares the Lord
Almighty. "Because of my house, which
remains a ruin, while each of you is
busy with his own house.
10Therefore, because of you the
heavens have withheld their dew and
the earth its crops.
11I called for a drought on the fields and
the mountains, on the grain, the new
wine, the oil and whatever the ground
produces, on men and cattle, and on the
labor of your hands."
12Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,
Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high
priest, and the whole remnant of the
people obeyed the voice of the Lord
their God and the message of the
prophet Haggai, because the Lord their
God had sent him. And the people
feared the Lord .
13Then Haggai, the Lord 's messenger,
gave this message of the Lord to the
people: "I am with you," declares the
Lord .
14So the Lord stirred up the spirit of
Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of
Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of
Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit
of the whole remnant of the people.
They came and began to work on the
house of the Lord Almighty, their God,
15on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth
month in the second year of King Darius.
2On the twenty-first day of the seventh
month, the word of the Lord came
through the prophet Haggai:
2"Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,
governor of Judah, to Joshua son of
Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the
remnant of the people. Ask them,
3'Who of you is left who saw this house
in its former glory? How does it look to
you now? Does it not seem to you like
nothing?
4But now be strong, O Zerubbabel,'
declares the Lord . 'Be strong, O Joshua
son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be
strong, all you people of the land,'
declares the Lord , 'and work. For I am
with you,' declares the Lord Almighty.
5'This is what I covenanted with you
when you came out of Egypt. And my
Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.'
6"This is what the Lord Almighty says: 'In
a little while I will once more shake the
heavens and the earth, the sea and the
dry land.
7I will shake all nations, and the desired
of all nations will come, and I will fill this
house with glory,' says the Lord
Almighty.
8'The silver is mine and the gold is
mine,' declares the Lord Almighty.
9'The glory of this present house will be
greater than the glory of the former
house,' says the Lord Almighty. 'And in
this place I will grant peace,' declares
the Lord Almighty."
10On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth
month, in the second year of Darius, the
word of the Lord came to the prophet
Haggai:
11"This is what the Lord Almighty says:
'Ask the priests what the law says:
12If a person carries consecrated meat
in the fold of his garment, and that fold
touches some bread or stew, some wine,
oil or other food, does it become
consecrated?' " The priests answered,
"No."
13Then Haggai said, "If a person defiled
by contact with a dead body touches
one of these things, does it become
defiled?" "Yes," the priests replied, "it
becomes defiled."
14Then Haggai said, " 'So it is with this
people and this nation in my sight,'
declares the Lord . 'Whatever they do
and whatever they offer there is defiled.
15" 'Now give careful thought to this from
this day on -consider how things were
before one stone was laid on another in
the Lord 's temple.
16When anyone came to a heap of
twenty measures, there were only ten.
When anyone went to a wine vat to
draw fifty measures, there were only
twenty.
17I struck all the work of your hands with
blight, mildew and hail, yet you did not
turn to me,' declares the Lord .
18'From this day on, from this twentyfourth
day of the ninth month, give
careful thought to the day when the
foundation of the Lord 's temple was laid.
Give careful thought:
19Is there yet any seed left in the barn?
Until now, the vine and the fig tree, the
pomegranate and the olive tree have not
borne fruit. " 'From this day on I will
bless you.' "
20The word of the Lord came to Haggai
a second time on the twenty-fourth day
of the month:
21"Tell Zerubbabel governor of Judah
that I will shake the heavens and the
earth.
22I will overturn royal thrones and shatter
the power of the foreign kingdoms. I will
overthrow chariots and their drivers;
horses and their riders will fall, each by
the sword of his brother.
23" 'On that day,' declares the Lord
Almighty, 'I will take you, my servant
Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,' declares
the Lord , 'and I will make you like my
signet ring, for I have chosen you,'
declares the Lord Almighty."
Zechariah
1In the eighth month of the second
year of Darius, the word of the Lord
came to the prophet Zechariah son of
Berekiah, the son of Iddo:
2"The Lord was very angry with your
forefathers.
3Therefore tell the people: This is what
the Lord Almighty says: 'Return to me,'
declares the Lord Almighty, 'and I will
return to you,' says the Lord Almighty.
4Do not be like your forefathers, to
whom the earlier prophets proclaimed:
This is what the Lord Almighty says:
'Turn from your evil ways and your evil
practices.' But they would not listen or
pay attention to me, declares the Lord .
5Where are your forefathers now? And
the prophets, do they live forever?
6But did not my words and my decrees,
which I commanded my servants the
prophets, overtake your forefathers?
"Then they repented and said, 'The Lord
Almighty has done to us what our ways
and practices deserve, just as he
determined to do.' " The Man Among the
Myrtle Trees
7On the twenty-fourth day of the
eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in
the second year of Darius, the word of
the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah
son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo.
8During the night I had a vision-and
there before me was a man riding a red
horse! He was standing among the
myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him
were red, brown and white horses.
9I asked, "What are these, my lord?"
The angel who was talking with me
answered, "I will show you what they
are."
10Then the man standing among the
myrtle trees explained, "They are the
ones the Lord has sent to go throughout
the earth."
11And they reported to the angel of the
Lord , who was standing among the
myrtle trees, "We have gone throughout
the earth and found the whole world at
rest and in peace."
12Then the angel of the Lord said, "Lord
Almighty, how long will you withhold
mercy from Jerusalem and from the
towns of Judah, which you have been
angry with these seventy years?"
13So the Lord spoke kind and comforting
words to the angel who talked with me.
14Then the angel who was speaking to
me said, "Proclaim this word: This is
what the Lord Almighty says: 'I am very
jealous for Jerusalem and Zion,
15but I am very angry with the nations
that feel secure. I was only a little angry,
but they added to the calamity.'
16"Therefore, this is what the Lord says:
'I will return to Jerusalem with mercy,
and there my house will be rebuilt. And
the measuring line will be stretched out
over Jerusalem,' declares the Lord
Almighty.
17"Proclaim further: This is what the Lord
Almighty says: 'My towns will again
overflow with prosperity, and the Lord
will again comfort Zion and choose
Jerusalem.' "
18Then I looked up-and there before me
were four horns!
19I asked the angel who was speaking to
me, "What are these?" He answered me,
"These are the horns that scattered
Judah, Israel and Jerusalem."
20Then the Lord showed me four
craftsmen.
21I asked, "What are these coming to
do?" He answered, "These are the
horns that scattered Judah so that no
one could raise his head, but the
craftsmen have come to terrify them and
throw down these horns of the nations
who lifted up their horns against the land
of Judah to scatter its people."
2Then I looked up-and there before
me was a man with a measuring line in
his hand!
2I asked, "Where are you going?" He
answered me, "To measure Jerusalem,
to find out how wide and how long it is."
3Then the angel who was speaking to
me left, and another angel came to meet
him
4and said to him: "Run, tell that young
man, 'Jerusalem will be a city without
walls because of the great number of
men and livestock in it.
5And I myself will be a wall of fire around
it,' declares the Lord , 'and I will be its
glory within.'
6"Come! Come! Flee from the land of
the north," declares the Lord , "for I have
scattered you to the four winds of
heaven," declares the Lord .
7"Come, O Zion! Escape, you who live in
the Daughter of Babylon!"
8For this is what the Lord Almighty says:
"After he has honored me and has sent
me against the nations that have
plundered you-for whoever touches you
touches the apple of his eye-
9I will surely raise my hand against them
so that their slaves will plunder them.
Then you will know that the Lord
Almighty has sent me.
10"Shout and be glad, O Daughter of
Zion. For I am coming, and I will live
among you," declares the Lord .
11"Many nations will be joined with the
Lord in that day and will become my
people. I will live among you and you
will know that the Lord Almighty has
sent me to you.
12The Lord will inherit Judah as his
portion in the holy land and will again
choose Jerusalem.
13Be still before the Lord , all mankind,
because he has roused himself from his
holy dwelling."
3Then he showed me Joshua the high
priest standing before the angel of the
Lord , and Satan standing at his right
side to accuse him.
2The Lord said to Satan, "The Lord
rebuke you, Satan! The Lord , who has
chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not
this man a burning stick snatched from
the fire?"
3Now Joshua was dressed in filthy
clothes as he stood before the angel.
4The angel said to those who were
standing before him, "Take off his filthy
clothes." Then he said to Joshua, "See, I
have taken away your sin, and I will put
rich garments on you."
5Then I said, "Put a clean turban on his
head." So they put a clean turban on his
head and clothed him, while the angel of
the Lord stood by.
6The angel of the Lord gave this charge
to Joshua:
7"This is what the Lord Almighty says: 'If
you will walk in my ways and keep my
requirements, then you will govern my
house and have charge of my courts,
and I will give you a place among these
standing here.
8" 'Listen, O high priest Joshua and your
associates seated before you, who are
men symbolic of things to come: I am
going to bring my servant, the Branch.
9See, the stone I have set in front of
Joshua! There are seven eyes on that
one stone, and I will engrave an
inscription on it,' says the Lord Almighty,
'and I will remove the sin of this land in a
single day.
10" 'In that day each of you will invite his
neighbor to sit under his vine and fig
tree,' declares the Lord Almighty."
4Then the angel who talked with me
returned and wakened me, as a man is
wakened from his sleep.
2He asked me, "What do you see?" I
answered, "I see a solid gold lampstand
with a bowl at the top and seven lights
on it, with seven channels to the lights.
3Also there are two olive trees by it, one
on the right of the bowl and the other on
its left."
4I asked the angel who talked with me,
"What are these, my lord?"
5He answered, "Do you not know what
these are?" "No, my lord," I replied.
6So he said to me, "This is the word of
the Lord to Zerubbabel: 'Not by might
nor by power, but by my Spirit,' says the
Lord Almighty.
7"What are you, O mighty mountain?
Before Zerubbabel you will become
level ground. Then he will bring out the
capstone to shouts of 'God bless it! God
bless it!' "
8Then the word of the Lord came to me:
9"The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the
foundation of this temple; his hands will
also complete it. Then you will know that
the Lord Almighty has sent me to you.
10"Who despises the day of small
things? Men will rejoice when they see
the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel.
"(These seven are the eyes of the Lord ,
which range throughout the earth.)"
11Then I asked the angel, "What are
these two olive trees on the right and
the left of the lampstand?"
12Again I asked him, "What are these
two olive branches beside the two gold
pipes that pour out golden oil?"
13He replied, "Do you not know what
these are?" "No, my lord," I said.
14So he said, "These are the two who
are anointed to serve the Lord of all the
earth."
5I looked again-and there before me
was a flying scroll!
2He asked me, "What do you see?" I
answered, "I see a flying scroll, thirty
feet long and fifteen feet wide. "
3And he said to me, "This is the curse
that is going out over the whole land; for
according to what it says on one side,
every thief will be banished, and
according to what it says on the other,
everyone who swears falsely will be
banished.
4The Lord Almighty declares, 'I will send
it out, and it will enter the house of the
thief and the house of him who swears
falsely by my name. It will remain in his
house and destroy it, both its timbers
and its stones.' "
5Then the angel who was speaking to
me came forward and said to me, "Look
up and see what this is that is
appearing."
6I asked, "What is it?" He replied, "It is a
measuring basket. " And he added,
"This is the iniquity of the people
throughout the land."
7Then the cover of lead was raised, and
there in the basket sat a woman!
8He said, "This is wickedness," and he
pushed her back into the basket and
pushed the lead cover down over its
mouth.
9Then I looked up-and there before me
were two women, with the wind in their
wings! They had wings like those of a
stork, and they lifted up the basket
between heaven and earth.
10"Where are they taking the basket?" I
asked the angel who was speaking to
me.
11He replied, "To the country of
Babylonia to build a house for it. When it
is ready, the basket will be set there in
its place."
6I looked up again-and there before
me were four chariots coming out from
between two mountains-mountains of
bronze!
2The first chariot had red horses, the
second black,
3the third white, and the fourth dappledall
of them powerful.
4I asked the angel who was speaking to
me, "What are these, my lord?"
5The angel answered me, "These are
the four spirits of heaven, going out from
standing in the presence of the Lord of
the whole world.
6The one with the black horses is going
toward the north country, the one with
the white horses toward the west, and
the one with the dappled horses toward
the south."
7When the powerful horses went out,
they were straining to go throughout the
earth. And he said, "Go throughout the
earth!" So they went throughout the
earth.
8Then he called to me, "Look, those
going toward the north country have
given my Spirit rest in the land of the
north."
9The word of the Lord came to me:
10"Take silver and gold from the exiles
Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah, who have
arrived from Babylon. Go the same day
to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah.
11Take the silver and gold and make a
crown, and set it on the head of the high
priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak.
12Tell him this is what the Lord Almighty
says: 'Here is the man whose name is
the Branch, and he will branch out from
his place and build the temple of the
Lord .
13It is he who will build the temple of the
Lord , and he will be clothed with
majesty and will sit and rule on his
throne. And he will be a priest on his
throne. And there will be harmony
between the two.'
14The crown will be given to Heldai,
Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen son of
Zephaniah as a memorial in the temple
of the Lord .
15Those who are far away will come and
help to build the temple of the Lord , and
you will know that the Lord Almighty has
sent me to you. This will happen if you
diligently obey the Lord your God."
7In the fourth year of King Darius, the
word of the Lord came to Zechariah on
the fourth day of the ninth month, the
month of Kislev.
2The people of Bethel had sent
Sharezer and Regem-Melech, together
with their men, to entreat the Lord
3by asking the priests of the house of
the Lord Almighty and the prophets,
"Should I mourn and fast in the fifth
month, as I have done for so many
years?"
4Then the word of the Lord Almighty
came to me:
5"Ask all the people of the land and the
priests, 'When you fasted and mourned
in the fifth and seventh months for the
past seventy years, was it really for me
that you fasted?
6And when you were eating and drinking,
were you not just feasting for
yourselves?
7Are these not the words the Lord
proclaimed through the earlier prophets
when Jerusalem and its surrounding
towns were at rest and prosperous, and
the Negev and the western foothills
were settled?' "
8And the word of the Lord came again to
Zechariah:
9"This is what the Lord Almighty says:
'Administer true justice; show mercy and
compassion to one another.
10Do not oppress the widow or the
fatherless, the alien or the poor. In your
hearts do not think evil of each other.'
11"But they refused to pay attention;
stubbornly they turned their backs and
stopped up their ears.
12They made their hearts as hard as flint
and would not listen to the law or to the
words that the Lord Almighty had sent
by his Spirit through the earlier prophets.
So the Lord Almighty was very angry.
13" 'When I called, they did not listen; so
when they called, I would not listen,'
says the Lord Almighty.
14'I scattered them with a whirlwind
among all the nations, where they were
strangers. The land was left so desolate
behind them that no one could come or
go. This is how they made the pleasant
land desolate.' "
8Again the word of the Lord Almighty
came to me.
2This is what the Lord Almighty says: "I
am very jealous for Zion; I am burning
with jealousy for her."
3This is what the Lord says: "I will return
to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem. Then
Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth,
and the mountain of the Lord Almighty
will be called the Holy Mountain."
4This is what the Lord Almighty says:
"Once again men and women of ripe old
age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem,
each with cane in hand because of his
age.
5The city streets will be filled with boys
and girls playing there."
6This is what the Lord Almighty says: "It
may seem marvelous to the remnant of
this people at that time, but will it seem
marvelous to me?" declares the Lord
Almighty.
7This is what the Lord Almighty says: "I
will save my people from the countries
of the east and the west.
8I will bring them back to live in
Jerusalem; they will be my people, and I
will be faithful and righteous to them as
their God."
9This is what the Lord Almighty says:
"You who now hear these words spoken
by the prophets who were there when
the foundation was laid for the house of
the Lord Almighty, let your hands be
strong so that the temple may be built.
10Before that time there were no wages
for man or beast. No one could go about
his business safely because of his
enemy, for I had turned every man
against his neighbor.
11But now I will not deal with the
remnant of this people as I did in the
past," declares the Lord Almighty.
12"The seed will grow well, the vine will
yield its fruit, the ground will produce its
crops, and the heavens will drop their
dew. I will give all these things as an
inheritance to the remnant of this people.
13As you have been an object of cursing
among the nations, O Judah and Israel,
so will I save you, and you will be a
blessing. Do not be afraid, but let your
hands be strong."
14This is what the Lord Almighty says:
"Just as I had determined to bring
disaster upon you and showed no pity
when your fathers angered me," says
the Lord Almighty,
15"so now I have determined to do good
again to Jerusalem and Judah. Do not
be afraid.
16These are the things you are to do:
Speak the truth to each other, and
render true and sound judgment in your
courts;
17do not plot evil against your neighbor,
and do not love to swear falsely. I hate
all this," declares the Lord .
18Again the word of the Lord Almighty
came to me.
19This is what the Lord Almighty says:
"The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh
and tenth months will become joyful and
glad occasions and happy festivals for
Judah. Therefore love truth and peace."
20This is what the Lord Almighty says:
"Many peoples and the inhabitants of
many cities will yet come,
21and the inhabitants of one city will go
to another and say, 'Let us go at once to
entreat the Lord and seek the Lord
Almighty. I myself am going.'
22And many peoples and powerful
nations will come to Jerusalem to seek
the Lord Almighty and to entreat him."
23This is what the Lord Almighty says:
"In those days ten men from all
languages and nations will take firm
hold of one Jew by the hem of his robe
and say, 'Let us go with you, because
we have heard that God is with you.' "
9The word of the Lord is against the
land of Hadrach and will rest upon
Damascus- for the eyes of men and all
the tribes of Israel are on the Lord -
2and upon Hamath too, which borders
on it, and upon Tyre and Sidon, though
they are very skillful.
3Tyre has built herself a stronghold; she
has heaped up silver like dust, and gold
like the dirt of the streets.
4But the Lord will take away her
possessions and destroy her power on
the sea, and she will be consumed by
fire.
5Ashkelon will see it and fear; Gaza will
writhe in agony, and Ekron too, for her
hope will wither. Gaza will lose her king
and Ashkelon will be deserted.
6Foreigners will occupy Ashdod, and I
will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
7I will take the blood from their mouths,
the forbidden food from between their
teeth. Those who are left will belong to
our God and become leaders in Judah,
and Ekron will be like the Jebusites.
8But I will defend my house against
marauding forces. Never again will an
oppressor overrun my people, for now I
am keeping watch.
9Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion!
Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem! See,
your king comes to you, righteous and
having salvation, gentle and riding on a
donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
10I will take away the chariots from
Ephraim and the war-horses from
Jerusalem, and the battle bow will be
broken. He will proclaim peace to the
nations. His rule will extend from sea to
sea and from the River to the ends of
the earth.
11As for you, because of the blood of my
covenant with you, I will free your
prisoners from the waterless pit.
12Return to your fortress, O prisoners of
hope; even now I announce that I will
restore twice as much to you.
13I will bend Judah as I bend my bow
and fill it with Ephraim. I will rouse your
sons, O Zion, against your sons, O
Greece, and make you like a warrior's
sword.
14Then the Lord will appear over them;
his arrow will flash like lightning. The
Sovereign Lord will sound the trumpet;
he will march in the storms of the south,
15and the Lord Almighty will shield them.
They will destroy and overcome with
slingstones. They will drink and roar as
with wine; they will be full like a bowl
used for sprinkling the corners of the
altar.
16The Lord their God will save them on
that day as the flock of his people. They
will sparkle in his land like jewels in a
crown.
17How attractive and beautiful they will
be! Grain will make the young men
thrive, and new wine the young women.
10Ask the Lord for rain in the
springtime; it is the Lord who makes the
storm clouds. He gives showers of rain
to men, and plants of the field to
everyone.
2The idols speak deceit, diviners see
visions that lie; they tell dreams that are
false, they give comfort in vain.
Therefore the people wander like sheep
oppressed for lack of a shepherd.
3"My anger burns against the shepherds,
and I will punish the leaders; for the
Lord Almighty will care for his flock, the
house of Judah, and make them like a
proud horse in battle.
4From Judah will come the cornerstone,
from him the tent peg, from him the
battle bow, from him every ruler.
5Together they will be like mighty men
trampling the muddy streets in battle.
Because the Lord is with them, they will
fight and overthrow the horsemen.
6"I will strengthen the house of Judah
and save the house of Joseph. I will
restore them because I have
compassion on them. They will be as
though I had not rejected them, for I am
the Lord their God and I will answer
them.
7The Ephraimites will become like
mighty men, and their hearts will be glad
as with wine. Their children will see it
and be joyful; their hearts will rejoice in
the Lord .
8I will signal for them and gather them in.
Surely I will redeem them; they will be
as numerous as before.
9Though I scatter them among the
peoples, yet in distant lands they will
remember me. They and their children
will survive, and they will return.
10I will bring them back from Egypt and
gather them from Assyria. I will bring
them to Gilead and Lebanon, and there
will not be room enough for them.
11They will pass through the sea of
trouble; the surging sea will be subdued
and all the depths of the Nile will dry up.
Assyria's pride will be brought down and
Egypt's scepter will pass away.
12I will strengthen them in the Lord and
in his name they will walk," declares the
Lord .
11Open your doors, O Lebanon, so
that fire may devour your cedars!
2Wail, O pine tree, for the cedar has
fallen; the stately trees are ruined! Wail,
oaks of Bashan; the dense forest has
been cut down!
3Listen to the wail of the shepherds;
their rich pastures are destroyed! Listen
to the roar of the lions; the lush thicket
of the Jordan is ruined!
4This is what the Lord my God says:
"Pasture the flock marked for slaughter.
5Their buyers slaughter them and go
unpunished. Those who sell them say,
'Praise the Lord , I am rich!' Their own
shepherds do not spare them.
6For I will no longer have pity on the
people of the land," declares the Lord .
"I will hand everyone over to his
neighbor and his king. They will oppress
the land, and I will not rescue them from
their hands."
7So I pastured the flock marked for
slaughter, particularly the oppressed of
the flock. Then I took two staffs and
called one Favor and the other Union,
and I pastured the flock.
8In one month I got rid of the three
shepherds. The flock detested me, and I
grew weary of them
9and said, "I will not be your shepherd.
Let the dying die, and the perishing
perish. Let those who are left eat one
another's flesh."
10Then I took my staff called Favor and
broke it, revoking the covenant I had
made with all the nations.
11It was revoked on that day, and so the
afflicted of the flock who were watching
me knew it was the word of the Lord .
12I told them, "If you think it best, give
me my pay; but if not, keep it." So they
paid me thirty pieces of silver.
13And the Lord said to me, "Throw it to
the potter"-the handsome price at which
they priced me! So I took the thirty
pieces of silver and threw them into the
house of the Lord to the potter.
14Then I broke my second staff called
Union, breaking the brotherhood
between Judah and Israel.
15Then the Lord said to me, "Take again
the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
16For I am going to raise up a shepherd
over the land who will not care for the
lost, or seek the young, or heal the
injured, or feed the healthy, but will eat
the meat of the choice sheep, tearing off
their hoofs.
17"Woe to the worthless shepherd, who
deserts the flock! May the sword strike
his arm and his right eye! May his arm
be completely withered, his right eye
totally blinded!"
12This is the word of the Lord
concerning Israel. The Lord , who
stretches out the heavens, who lays the
foundation of the earth, and who forms
the spirit of man within him, declares:
2"I am going to make Jerusalem a cup
that sends all the surrounding peoples
reeling. Judah will be besieged as well
as Jerusalem.
3On that day, when all the nations of the
earth are gathered against her, I will
make Jerusalem an immovable rock for
all the nations. All who try to move it will
injure themselves.
4On that day I will strike every horse with
panic and its rider with madness,"
declares the Lord . "I will keep a
watchful eye over the house of Judah,
but I will blind all the horses of the
nations.
5Then the leaders of Judah will say in
their hearts, 'The people of Jerusalem
are strong, because the Lord Almighty is
their God.'
6"On that day I will make the leaders of
Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a
flaming torch among sheaves. They will
consume right and left all the
surrounding peoples, but Jerusalem will
remain intact in her place.
7"The Lord will save the dwellings of
Judah first, so that the honor of the
house of David and of Jerusalem's
inhabitants may not be greater than that
of Judah.
8On that day the Lord will shield those
who live in Jerusalem, so that the
feeblest among them will be like David,
and the house of David will be like God,
like the Angel of the Lord going before
them.
9On that day I will set out to destroy all
the nations that attack Jerusalem.
10"And I will pour out on the house of
David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
a spirit of grace and supplication. They
will look on me, the one they have
pierced, and they will mourn for him as
one mourns for an only child, and grieve
bitterly for him as one grieves for a
firstborn son.
11On that day the weeping in Jerusalem
will be great, like the weeping of Hadad
Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
12The land will mourn, each clan by itself,
with their wives by themselves: the clan
of the house of David and their wives,
the clan of the house of Nathan and
their wives,
13the clan of the house of Levi and their
wives, the clan of Shimei and their wives,
14and all the rest of the clans and their
wives.
13"On that day a fountain will be
opened to the house of David and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse
them from sin and impurity.
2"On that day, I will banish the names of
the idols from the land, and they will be
remembered no more," declares the
Lord Almighty. "I will remove both the
prophets and the spirit of impurity from
the land.
3And if anyone still prophesies, his
father and mother, to whom he was born,
will say to him, 'You must die, because
you have told lies in the Lord 's name.'
When he prophesies, his own parents
will stab him.
4"On that day every prophet will be
ashamed of his prophetic vision. He will
not put on a prophet's garment of hair in
order to deceive.
5He will say, 'I am not a prophet. I am a
farmer; the land has been my livelihood
since my youth. '
6If someone asks him, 'What are these
wounds on your body ?' he will answer,
'The wounds I was given at the house of
my friends.'
7"Awake, O sword, against my shepherd,
against the man who is close to me!"
declares the Lord Almighty. "Strike the
shepherd, and the sheep will be
scattered, and I will turn my hand
against the little ones.
8In the whole land," declares the Lord ,
"two-thirds will be struck down and
perish; yet one-third will be left in it.
9This third I will bring into the fire; I will
refine them like silver and test them like
gold. They will call on my name and I
will answer them; I will say, 'They are
my people,' and they will say, 'The Lord
is our God.' "
14A day of the Lord is coming when
your plunder will be divided among you.
2I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem
to fight against it; the city will be
captured, the houses ransacked, and
the women raped. Half of the city will go
into exile, but the rest of the people will
not be taken from the city.
3Then the Lord will go out and fight
against those nations, as he fights in the
day of battle.
4On that day his feet will stand on the
Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and
the Mount of Olives will be split in two
from east to west, forming a great valley,
with half of the mountain moving north
and half moving south.
5You will flee by my mountain valley, for
it will extend to Azel. You will flee as you
fled from the earthquake in the days of
Uzziah king of Judah. Then the Lord my
God will come, and all the holy ones
with him.
6On that day there will be no light, no
cold or frost.
7It will be a unique day, without daytime
or nighttime-a day known to the Lord .
When evening comes, there will be light.
8On that day living water will flow out
from Jerusalem, half to the eastern sea
and half to the western sea, in summer
and in winter.
9The Lord will be king over the whole
earth. On that day there will be one
Lord , and his name the only name.
10The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon,
south of Jerusalem, will become like the
Arabah. But Jerusalem will be raised up
and remain in its place, from the
Benjamin Gate to the site of the First
Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the
Tower of Hananel to the royal
winepresses.
11It will be inhabited; never again will it
be destroyed. Jerusalem will be secure.
12This is the plague with which the Lord
will strike all the nations that fought
against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot
while they are still standing on their feet,
their eyes will rot in their sockets, and
their tongues will rot in their mouths.
13On that day men will be stricken by the
Lord with great panic. Each man will
seize the hand of another, and they will
attack each other.
14Judah too will fight at Jerusalem. The
wealth of all the surrounding nations will
be collected-great quantities of gold and
silver and clothing.
15A similar plague will strike the horses
and mules, the camels and donkeys,
and all the animals in those camps.
16Then the survivors from all the nations
that have attacked Jerusalem will go up
year after year to worship the King, the
Lord Almighty, and to celebrate the
Feast of Tabernacles.
17If any of the peoples of the earth do
not go up to Jerusalem to worship the
King, the Lord Almighty, they will have
no rain.
18If the Egyptian people do not go up
and take part, they will have no rain.
The Lord will bring on them the plague
he inflicts on the nations that do not go
up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.
19This will be the punishment of Egypt
and the punishment of all the nations
that do not go up to celebrate the Feast
of Tabernacles.
20On that dayHOLY TO THE Lord will be
inscribed on the bells of the horses, and
the cooking pots in the Lord 's house will
be like the sacred bowls in front of the
altar.
21Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will
be holy to the Lord Almighty, and all
who come to sacrifice will take some of
the pots and cook in them. And on that
day there will no longer be a Canaanite
in the house of the Lord Almighty.
Malachi
1An oracle: The word of the Lord to
Israel through Malachi.
2"I have loved you," says the Lord . "But
you ask, 'How have you loved us?' "Was
not Esau Jacob's brother?" the Lord
says. "Yet I have loved Jacob,
3but Esau I have hated, and I have
turned his mountains into a wasteland
and left his inheritance to the desert
jackals."
4Edom may say, "Though we have been
crushed, we will rebuild the ruins." But
this is what the Lord Almighty says:
"They may build, but I will demolish.
They will be called the Wicked Land, a
people always under the wrath of the
Lord .
5You will see it with your own eyes and
say, 'Great is the Lord -even beyond the
borders of Israel!'
6"A son honors his father, and a servant
his master. If I am a father, where is the
honor due me? If I am a master, where
is the respect due me?" says the Lord
Almighty. "It is you, O priests, who show
contempt for my name. "But you ask,
'How have we shown contempt for your
name?'
7"You place defiled food on my altar.
"But you ask, 'How have we defiled
you?' "By saying that the Lord 's table is
contemptible.
8When you bring blind animals for
sacrifice, is that not wrong? When you
sacrifice crippled or diseased animals, is
that not wrong? Try offering them to
your governor! Would he be pleased
with you? Would he accept you?" says
the Lord Almighty.
9"Now implore God to be gracious to us.
With such offerings from your hands, will
he accept you?"-says the Lord Almighty.
10"Oh, that one of you would shut the
temple doors, so that you would not light
useless fires on my altar! I am not
pleased with you," says the Lord
Almighty, "and I will accept no offering
from your hands.
11My name will be great among the
nations, from the rising to the setting of
the sun. In every place incense and
pure offerings will be brought to my
name, because my name will be great
among the nations," says the Lord
Almighty.
12"But you profane it by saying of the
Lord's table, 'It is defiled,' and of its food,
'It is contemptible.'
13And you say, 'What a burden!' and you
sniff at it contemptuously," says the Lord
Almighty. "When you bring injured,
crippled or diseased animals and offer
them as sacrifices, should I accept them
from your hands?" says the Lord .
14"Cursed is the cheat who has an
acceptable male in his flock and vows to
give it, but then sacrifices a blemished
animal to the Lord. For I am a great
king," says the Lord Almighty, "and my
name is to be feared among the nations.
2"And now this admonition is for you,
O priests.
2If you do not listen, and if you do not
set your heart to honor my name," says
the Lord Almighty, "I will send a curse
upon you, and I will curse your blessings.
Yes, I have already cursed them,
because you have not set your heart to
honor me.
3"Because of you I will rebuke your
descendants ; I will spread on your
faces the offal from your festival
sacrifices, and you will be carried off
with it.
4And you will know that I have sent you
this admonition so that my covenant
with Levi may continue," says the Lord
Almighty.
5"My covenant was with him, a covenant
of life and peace, and I gave them to
him; this called for reverence and he
revered me and stood in awe of my
name.
6True instruction was in his mouth and
nothing false was found on his lips. He
walked with me in peace and
uprightness, and turned many from sin.
7"For the lips of a priest ought to
preserve knowledge, and from his
mouth men should seek instructionbecause
he is the messenger of the
Lord Almighty.
8But you have turned from the way and
by your teaching have caused many to
stumble; you have violated the covenant
with Levi," says the Lord Almighty.
9"So I have caused you to be despised
and humiliated before all the people,
because you have not followed my ways
but have shown partiality in matters of
the law."
10Have we not all one Father ? Did not
one God create us? Why do we profane
the covenant of our fathers by breaking
faith with one another?
11Judah has broken faith. A detestable
thing has been committed in Israel and
in Jerusalem: Judah has desecrated the
sanctuary the Lord loves, by marrying
the daughter of a foreign god.
12As for the man who does this, whoever
he may be, may the Lord cut him off
from the tents of Jacob -even though he
brings offerings to the Lord Almighty.
13Another thing you do: You flood the
Lord 's altar with tears. You weep and
wail because he no longer pays
attention to your offerings or accepts
them with pleasure from your hands.
14You ask, "Why?" It is because the Lord
is acting as the witness between you
and the wife of your youth, because you
have broken faith with her, though she is
your partner, the wife of your marriage
covenant.
15Has not the Lord made them one? In
flesh and spirit they are his. And why
one? Because he was seeking godly
offspring. So guard yourself in your spirit,
and do not break faith with the wife of
your youth.
16"I hate divorce," says the Lord God of
Israel, "and I hate a man's covering
himself with violence as well as with his
garment," says the Lord Almighty. So
guard yourself in your spirit, and do not
break faith.
17You have wearied the Lord with your
words. "How have we wearied him?"
you ask. By saying, "All who do evil are
good in the eyes of the Lord , and he is
pleased with them" or "Where is the God
of justice?"
3"See, I will send my messenger, who
will prepare the way before me. Then
suddenly the Lord you are seeking will
come to his temple; the messenger of
the covenant, whom you desire, will
come," says the Lord Almighty.
2But who can endure the day of his
coming? Who can stand when he
appears? For he will be like a refiner's
fire or a launderer's soap.
3He will sit as a refiner and purifier of
silver; he will purify the Levites and
refine them like gold and silver. Then
the Lord will have men who will bring
offerings in righteousness,
4and the offerings of Judah and
Jerusalem will be acceptable to the
Lord , as in days gone by, as in former
years.
5"So I will come near to you for
judgment. I will be quick to testify
against sorcerers, adulterers and
perjurers, against those who defraud
laborers of their wages, who oppress
the widows and the fatherless, and
deprive aliens of justice, but do not fear
me," says the Lord Almighty.
6"I the Lord do not change. So you, O
descendants of Jacob, are not
destroyed.
7Ever since the time of your forefathers
you have turned away from my decrees
and have not kept them. Return to me,
and I will return to you," says the Lord
Almighty. "But you ask, 'How are we to
return?'
8"Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me.
"But you ask, 'How do we rob you?' "In
tithes and offerings.
9You are under a curse-the whole nation
of you-because you are robbing me.
10Bring the whole tithe into the
storehouse, that there may be food in
my house. Test me in this," says the
Lord Almighty, "and see if I will not throw
open the floodgates of heaven and pour
out so much blessing that you will not
have room enough for it.
11I will prevent pests from devouring
your crops, and the vines in your fields
will not cast their fruit," says the Lord
Almighty.
12"Then all the nations will call you
blessed, for yours will be a delightful
land," says the Lord Almighty.
13"You have said harsh things against
me," says the Lord . "Yet you ask, 'What
have we said against you?'
14"You have said, 'It is futile to serve
God. What did we gain by carrying out
his requirements and going about like
mourners before the Lord Almighty?
15But now we call the arrogant blessed.
Certainly the evildoers prosper, and
even those who challenge God escape.'
"
16Then those who feared the Lord talked
with each other, and the Lord listened
and heard. A scroll of remembrance was
written in his presence concerning those
who feared the Lord and honored his
name.
17"They will be mine," says the Lord
Almighty, "in the day when I make up
my treasured possession. I will spare
them, just as in compassion a man
spares his son who serves him.
18And you will again see the distinction
between the righteous and the wicked,
between those who serve God and
those who do not.
4"Surely the day is coming; it will burn
like a furnace. All the arrogant and every
evildoer will be stubble, and that day
that is coming will set them on fire," says
the Lord Almighty. "Not a root or a
branch will be left to them.
2But for you who revere my name, the
sun of righteousness will rise with
healing in its wings. And you will go out
and leap like calves released from the
stall.
3Then you will trample down the wicked;
they will be ashes under the soles of
your feet on the day when I do these
things," says the Lord Almighty.
4"Remember the law of my servant
Moses, the decrees and laws I gave him
at Horeb for all Israel.
5"See, I will send you the prophet Elijah
before that great and dreadful day of the
Lord comes.
6He will turn the hearts of the fathers to
their children, and the hearts of the
children to their fathers; or else I will
come and strike the land with a curse."
Matthew
1A record of the genealogy of Jesus
Christ the son of David, the son of
Abraham:
2Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac
the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of
Judah and his brothers,
3Judah the father of Perez and Zerah,
whose mother was Tamar, Perez the
father of Hezron, Hezron the father of
Ram,
4Ram the father of Amminadab,
Amminadab the father of Nahshon,
Nahshon the father of Salmon,
5Salmon the father of Boaz, whose
mother was Rahab, Boaz the father of
Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed
the father of Jesse,
6and Jesse the father of King David.
David was the father of Solomon, whose
mother had been Uriah's wife,
7Solomon the father of Rehoboam,
Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah
the father of Asa,
8Asa the father of Jehoshaphat,
Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram,
Jehoram the father of Uzziah,
9Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham
the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of
Hezekiah,
10Hezekiah the father of Manasseh,
Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the
father of Josiah,
11and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and
his brothers at the time of the exile to
Babylon.
12After the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah
was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the
father of Zerubbabel,
13Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud
the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father
of Azor,
14Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the
father of Akim, Akim the father of Eliud,
15Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the
father of Matthan, Matthan the father of
Jacob,
16and Jacob the father of Joseph, the
husband of Mary, of whom was born
Jesus, who is called Christ.
17Thus there were fourteen generations
in all from Abraham to David, fourteen
from David to the exile to Babylon, and
fourteen from the exile to the Christ.
18This is how the birth of Jesus Christ
came about: His mother Mary was
pledged to be married to Joseph, but
before they came together, she was
found to be with child through the Holy
Spirit.
19Because Joseph her husband was a
righteous man and did not want to
expose her to public disgrace, he had in
mind to divorce her quietly.
20But after he had considered this, an
angel of the Lord appeared to him in a
dream and said, "Joseph son of David,
do not be afraid to take Mary home as
your wife, because what is conceived in
her is from the Holy Spirit.
21She will give birth to a son, and you
are to give him the name Jesus,
because he will save his people from
their sins."
22All this took place to fulfill what the
Lord had said through the prophet:
23"The virgin will be with child and will
give birth to a son, and they will call him
Immanuel" --which means, "God with
us."
24When Joseph woke up, he did what
the angel of the Lord had commanded
him and took Mary home as his wife.
25But he had no union with her until she
gave birth to a son. And he gave him the
name Jesus.
2After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in
Judea, during the time of King Herod,
Magi from the east came to Jerusalem
2and asked, "Where is the one who has
been born king of the Jews? We saw his
star in the east and have come to
worship him."
3When King Herod heard this he was
disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
4When he had called together all the
people's chief priests and teachers of
the law, he asked them where the Christ
was to be born.
5"In Bethlehem in Judea," they replied,
"for this is what the prophet has written:
6" 'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of
Judah, are by no means least among
the rulers of Judah; for out of you will
come a ruler who will be the shepherd of
my people Israel.' "
7Then Herod called the Magi secretly
and found out from them the exact time
the star had appeared.
8He sent them to Bethlehem and said,
"Go and make a careful search for the
child. As soon as you find him, report to
me, so that I too may go and worship
him."
9After they had heard the king, they
went on their way, and the star they had
seen in the east went ahead of them
until it stopped over the place where the
child was.
10When they saw the star, they were
overjoyed.
11On coming to the house, they saw the
child with his mother Mary, and they
bowed down and worshiped him. Then
they opened their treasures and
presented him with gifts of gold and of
incense and of myrrh.
12And having been warned in a dream
not to go back to Herod, they returned to
their country by another route.
13When they had gone, an angel of the
Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream.
"Get up," he said, "take the child and his
mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there
until I tell you, for Herod is going to
search for the child to kill him."
14So he got up, took the child and his
mother during the night and left for
Egypt,
15where he stayed until the death of
Herod. And so was fulfilled what the
Lord had said through the prophet: "Out
of Egypt I called my son."
16When Herod realized that he had been
outwitted by the Magi, he was furious,
and he gave orders to kill all the boys in
Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two
years old and under, in accordance with
the time he had learned from the Magi.
17Then what was said through the
prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:
18"A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping
and great mourning, Rachel weeping for
her children and refusing to be
comforted, because they are no more."
19After Herod died, an angel of the Lord
appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
20and said, "Get up, take the child and
his mother and go to the land of Israel,
for those who were trying to take the
child's life are dead."
21So he got up, took the child and his
mother and went to the land of Israel.
22But when he heard that Archelaus was
reigning in Judea in place of his father
Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having
been warned in a dream, he withdrew to
the district of Galilee,
23and he went and lived in a town called
Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said
through the prophets: "He will be called
a Nazarene."
3In those days John the Baptist came,
preaching in the Desert of Judea
2and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of
heaven is near."
3This is he who was spoken of through
the prophet Isaiah: "A voice of one
calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way
for the Lord, make straight paths for
him.' "
4John's clothes were made of camel's
hair, and he had a leather belt around
his waist. His food was locusts and wild
honey.
5People went out to him from Jerusalem
and all Judea and the whole region of
the Jordan.
6Confessing their sins, they were
baptized by him in the Jordan River.
7But when he saw many of the
Pharisees and Sadducees coming to
where he was baptizing, he said to
them: "You brood of vipers! Who warned
you to flee from the coming wrath?
8Produce fruit in keeping with
repentance.
9And do not think you can say to
yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our
father.' I tell you that out of these stones
God can raise up children for Abraham.
10The ax is already at the root of the
trees, and every tree that does not
produce good fruit will be cut down and
thrown into the fire.
11"I baptize you with water for
repentance. But after me will come one
who is more powerful than I, whose
sandals I am not fit to carry. He will
baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with
fire.
12His winnowing fork is in his hand, and
he will clear his threshing floor,
gathering his wheat into the barn and
burning up the chaff with unquenchable
fire."
13Then Jesus came from Galilee to the
Jordan to be baptized by John.
14But John tried to deter him, saying, "I
need to be baptized by you, and do you
come to me?"
15Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is
proper for us to do this to fulfill all
righteousness." Then John consented.
16As soon as Jesus was baptized, he
went up out of the water. At that
moment heaven was opened, and he
saw the Spirit of God descending like a
dove and lighting on him.
17And a voice from heaven said, "This is
my Son, whom I love; with him I am well
pleased."
4Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into
the desert to be tempted by the devil.
2After fasting forty days and forty nights,
he was hungry.
3The tempter came to him and said, "If
you are the Son of God, tell these
stones to become bread."
4Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man
does not live on bread alone, but on
every word that comes from the mouth
of God.' "
5Then the devil took him to the holy city
and had him stand on the highest point
of the temple.
6"If you are the Son of God," he said,
"throw yourself down. For it is written: "
'He will command his angels concerning
you, and they will lift you up in their
hands, so that you will not strike your
foot against a stone.' "
7Jesus answered him, "It is also written:
'Do not put the Lord your God to the
test.' "
8Again, the devil took him to a very high
mountain and showed him all the
kingdoms of the world and their
splendor.
9"All this I will give you," he said, "if you
will bow down and worship me."
10Jesus said to him, "Away from me,
Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the
Lord your God, and serve him only.' "
11Then the devil left him, and angels
came and attended him.
12When Jesus heard that John had been
put in prison, he returned to Galilee.
13Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in
Capernaum, which was by the lake in
the area of Zebulun and Naphtali--
14to fulfill what was said through the
prophet Isaiah:
15"Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,
the way to the sea, along the Jordan,
Galilee of the Gentiles--
16the people living in darkness have
seen a great light; on those living in the
land of the shadow of death a light has
dawned."
17From that time on Jesus began to
preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of
heaven is near."
18As Jesus was walking beside the Sea
of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon
called Peter and his brother Andrew.
They were casting a net into the lake,
for they were fishermen.
19"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I
will make you fishers of men."
20At once they left their nets and
followed him.
21Going on from there, he saw two other
brothers, James son of Zebedee and his
brother John. They were in a boat with
their father Zebedee, preparing their
nets. Jesus called them,
22and immediately they left the boat and
their father and followed him.
23Jesus went throughout Galilee,
teaching in their synagogues, preaching
the good news of the kingdom, and
healing every disease and sickness
among the people.
24News about him spread all over Syria,
and people brought to him all who were
ill with various diseases, those suffering
severe pain, the demon-possessed,
those having seizures, and the
paralyzed, and he healed them.
25Large crowds from Galilee, the
Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the
region across the Jordan followed him.
5Now when he saw the crowds, he
went up on a mountainside and sat
down. His disciples came to him,
2and he began to teach them saying:
3"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs
is the kingdom of heaven.
4Blessed are those who mourn, for they
will be comforted.
5Blessed are the meek, for they will
inherit the earth.
6Blessed are those who hunger and
thirst for righteousness, for they will be
filled.
7Blessed are the merciful, for they will
be shown mercy.
8Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
will see God.
9Blessed are the peacemakers, for they
will be called sons of God.
10Blessed are those who are persecuted
because of righteousness, for theirs is
the kingdom of heaven.
11"Blessed are you when people insult
you, persecute you and falsely say all
kinds of evil against you because of me.
12Rejoice and be glad, because great is
your reward in heaven, for in the same
way they persecuted the prophets who
were before you.
13"You are the salt of the earth. But if the
salt loses its saltiness, how can it be
made salty again? It is no longer good
for anything, except to be thrown out
and trampled by men.
14"You are the light of the world. A city
on a hill cannot be hidden.
15Neither do people light a lamp and put
it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its
stand, and it gives light to everyone in
the house.
16In the same way, let your light shine
before men, that they may see your
good deeds and praise your Father in
heaven.
17"Do not think that I have come to
abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have
not come to abolish them but to fulfill
them.
18I tell you the truth, until heaven and
earth disappear, not the smallest letter,
not the least stroke of a pen, will by any
means disappear from the Law until
everything is accomplished.
19Anyone who breaks one of the least of
these commandments and teaches
others to do the same will be called
least in the kingdom of heaven, but
whoever practices and teaches these
commands will be called great in the
kingdom of heaven.
20For I tell you that unless your
righteousness surpasses that of the
Pharisees and the teachers of the law,
you will certainly not enter the kingdom
of heaven.
21"You have heard that it was said to the
people long ago, 'Do not murder, and
anyone who murders will be subject to
judgment.'
22But I tell you that anyone who is angry
with his brother will be subject to
judgment. Again, anyone who says to
his brother, 'Raca, ' is answerable to the
Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You
fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.
23"Therefore, if you are offering your gift
at the altar and there remember that
your brother has something against you,
24leave your gift there in front of the altar.
First go and be reconciled to your
brother; then come and offer your gift.
25"Settle matters quickly with your
adversary who is taking you to court. Do
it while you are still with him on the way,
or he may hand you over to the judge,
and the judge may hand you over to the
officer, and you may be thrown into
prison.
26I tell you the truth, you will not get out
until you have paid the last penny.
27"You have heard that it was said, 'Do
not commit adultery.'
28But I tell you that anyone who looks at
a woman lustfully has already
committed adultery with her in his heart.
29If your right eye causes you to sin,
gouge it out and throw it away. It is
better for you to lose one part of your
body than for your whole body to be
thrown into hell.
30And if your right hand causes you to
sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is
better for you to lose one part of your
body than for your whole body to go into
hell.
31"It has been said, 'Anyone who
divorces his wife must give her a
certificate of divorce.'
32But I tell you that anyone who divorces
his wife, except for marital
unfaithfulness, causes her to become an
adulteress, and anyone who marries the
divorced woman commits adultery.
33"Again, you have heard that it was said
to the people long ago, 'Do not break
your oath, but keep the oaths you have
made to the Lord.'
34But I tell you, Do not swear at all:
either by heaven, for it is God's throne;
35or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or
by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the
Great King.
36And do not swear by your head, for
you cannot make even one hair white or
black.
37Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your
'No,' 'No'; anything beyond this comes
from the evil one.
38"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye
for eye, and tooth for tooth.'
39But I tell you, Do not resist an evil
person. If someone strikes you on the
right cheek, turn to him the other also.
40And if someone wants to sue you and
take your tunic, let him have your cloak
as well.
41If someone forces you to go one mile,
go with him two miles.
42Give to the one who asks you, and do
not turn away from the one who wants
to borrow from you.
43"You have heard that it was said, 'Love
your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
44But I tell you: Love your enemies and
pray for those who persecute you,
45that you may be sons of your Father in
heaven. He causes his sun to rise on
the evil and the good, and sends rain on
the righteous and the unrighteous.
46If you love those who love you, what
reward will you get? Are not even the
tax collectors doing that?
47And if you greet only your brothers,
what are you doing more than others?
Do not even pagans do that?
48Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly
Father is perfect.
6"Be careful not to do your 'acts of
righteousness' before men, to be seen
by them. If you do, you will have no
reward from your Father in heaven.
2"So when you give to the needy, do not
announce it with trumpets, as the
hypocrites do in the synagogues and on
the streets, to be honored by men. I tell
you the truth, they have received their
reward in full.
3But when you give to the needy, do not
let your left hand know what your right
hand is doing,
4so that your giving may be in secret.
Then your Father, who sees what is
done in secret, will reward you.
5"And when you pray, do not be like the
hypocrites, for they love to pray standing
in the synagogues and on the street
corners to be seen by men. I tell you the
truth, they have received their reward in
full.
6But when you pray, go into your room,
close the door and pray to your Father,
who is unseen. Then your Father, who
sees what is done in secret, will reward
you.
7And when you pray, do not keep on
babbling like pagans, for they think they
will be heard because of their many
words.
8Do not be like them, for your Father
knows what you need before you ask
him.
9"This, then, is how you should pray: "
'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your
name,
10your kingdom come, your will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.
11Give us today our daily bread.
12Forgive us our debts, as we also have
forgiven our debtors.
13And lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from the evil one. '
14For if you forgive men when they sin
against you, your heavenly Father will
also forgive you.
15But if you do not forgive men their sins,
your Father will not forgive your sins.
16"When you fast, do not look somber as
the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their
faces to show men they are fasting. I tell
you the truth, they have received their
reward in full.
17But when you fast, put oil on your
head and wash your face,
18so that it will not be obvious to men
that you are fasting, but only to your
Father, who is unseen; and your Father,
who sees what is done in secret, will
reward you.
19"Do not store up for yourselves
treasures on earth, where moth and rust
destroy, and where thieves break in and
steal.
20But store up for yourselves treasures
in heaven, where moth and rust do not
destroy, and where thieves do not break
in and steal.
21For where your treasure is, there your
heart will be also.
22"The eye is the lamp of the body. If
your eyes are good, your whole body
will be full of light.
23But if your eyes are bad, your whole
body will be full of darkness. If then the
light within you is darkness, how great is
that darkness!
24"No one can serve two masters. Either
he will hate the one and love the other,
or he will be devoted to the one and
despise the other. You cannot serve
both God and Money.
25"Therefore I tell you, do not worry
about your life, what you will eat or
drink; or about your body, what you will
wear. Is not life more important than
food, and the body more important than
clothes?
26Look at the birds of the air; they do not
sow or reap or store away in barns, and
yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
Are you not much more valuable than
they?
27Who of you by worrying can add a
single hour to his life ?
28"And why do you worry about clothes?
See how the lilies of the field grow. They
do not labor or spin.
29Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in
all his splendor was dressed like one of
these.
30If that is how God clothes the grass of
the field, which is here today and
tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he
not much more clothe you, O you of little
faith?
31So do not worry, saying, 'What shall
we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or
'What shall we wear?'
32For the pagans run after all these
things, and your heavenly Father knows
that you need them.
33But seek first his kingdom and his
righteousness, and all these things will
be given to you as well.
34Therefore do not worry about
tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about
itself. Each day has enough trouble of
its own.
7"Do not judge, or you too will be
judged.
2For in the same way you judge others,
you will be judged, and with the
measure you use, it will be measured to
you.
3"Why do you look at the speck of
sawdust in your brother's eye and pay
no attention to the plank in your own
eye?
4How can you say to your brother, 'Let
me take the speck out of your eye,'
when all the time there is a plank in your
own eye?
5You hypocrite, first take the plank out of
your own eye, and then you will see
clearly to remove the speck from your
brother's eye.
6"Do not give dogs what is sacred; do
not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do,
they may trample them under their feet,
and then turn and tear you to pieces.
7"Ask and it will be given to you; seek
and you will find; knock and the door will
be opened to you.
8For everyone who asks receives; he
who seeks finds; and to him who knocks,
the door will be opened.
9"Which of you, if his son asks for bread,
will give him a stone?
10Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a
snake?
11If you, then, though you are evil, know
how to give good gifts to your children,
how much more will your Father in
heaven give good gifts to those who ask
him!
12So in everything, do to others what
you would have them do to you, for this
sums up the Law and the Prophets.
13"Enter through the narrow gate. For
wide is the gate and broad is the road
that leads to destruction, and many
enter through it.
14But small is the gate and narrow the
road that leads to life, and only a few
find it.
15"Watch out for false prophets. They
come to you in sheep's clothing, but
inwardly they are ferocious wolves.
16By their fruit you will recognize them.
Do people pick grapes from
thornbushes, or figs from thistles?
17Likewise every good tree bears good
fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
18A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and
a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
19Every tree that does not bear good
fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
20Thus, by their fruit you will recognize
them.
21"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord,
Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven,
but only he who does the will of my
Father who is in heaven.
22Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord,
Lord, did we not prophesy in your name,
and in your name drive out demons and
perform many miracles?'
23Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never
knew you. Away from me, you
evildoers!'
24"Therefore everyone who hears these
words of mine and puts them into
practice is like a wise man who built his
house on the rock.
25The rain came down, the streams rose,
and the winds blew and beat against
that house; yet it did not fall, because it
had its foundation on the rock.
26But everyone who hears these words
of mine and does not put them into
practice is like a foolish man who built
his house on sand.
27The rain came down, the streams rose,
and the winds blew and beat against
that house, and it fell with a great
crash."
28When Jesus had finished saying these
things, the crowds were amazed at his
teaching,
29because he taught as one who had
authority, and not as their teachers of
the law.
8When he came down from the
mountainside, large crowds followed
him.
2A man with leprosy came and knelt
before him and said, "Lord, if you are
willing, you can make me clean."
3Jesus reached out his hand and
touched the man. "I am willing," he said.
"Be clean!" Immediately he was cured of
his leprosy.
4Then Jesus said to him, "See that you
don't tell anyone. But go, show yourself
to the priest and offer the gift Moses
commanded, as a testimony to them."
5When Jesus had entered Capernaum,
a centurion came to him, asking for help.
6"Lord," he said, "my servant lies at
home paralyzed and in terrible
suffering."
7Jesus said to him, "I will go and heal
him."
8The centurion replied, "Lord, I do not
deserve to have you come under my
roof. But just say the word, and my
servant will be healed.
9For I myself am a man under authority,
with soldiers under me. I tell this one,
'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,'
and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do
this,' and he does it."
10When Jesus heard this, he was
astonished and said to those following
him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found
anyone in Israel with such great faith.
11I say to you that many will come from
the east and the west, and will take their
places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
12But the subjects of the kingdom will be
thrown outside, into the darkness, where
there will be weeping and gnashing of
teeth."
13Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go!
It will be done just as you believed it
would." And his servant was healed at
that very hour.
14When Jesus came into Peter's house,
he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in
bed with a fever.
15He touched her hand and the fever left
her, and she got up and began to wait
on him.
16When evening came, many who were
demon-possessed were brought to him,
and he drove out the spirits with a word
and healed all the sick.
17This was to fulfill what was spoken
through the prophet Isaiah: "He took up
our infirmities and carried our diseases."
18When Jesus saw the crowd around
him, he gave orders to cross to the other
side of the lake.
19Then a teacher of the law came to him
and said, "Teacher, I will follow you
wherever you go."
20Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes and
birds of the air have nests, but the Son
of Man has no place to lay his head."
21Another disciple said to him, "Lord,
first let me go and bury my father."
22But Jesus told him, "Follow me, and let
the dead bury their own dead."
23Then he got into the boat and his
disciples followed him.
24Without warning, a furious storm came
up on the lake, so that the waves swept
over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
25The disciples went and woke him,
saying, "Lord, save us! We're going to
drown!"
26He replied, "You of little faith, why are
you so afraid?" Then he got up and
rebuked the winds and the waves, and it
was completely calm.
27The men were amazed and asked,
"What kind of man is this? Even the
winds and the waves obey him!"
28When he arrived at the other side in
the region of the Gadarenes, two
demon-possessed men coming from the
tombs met him. They were so violent
that no one could pass that way.
29"What do you want with us, Son of
God?" they shouted. "Have you come
here to torture us before the appointed
time?"
30Some distance from them a large herd
of pigs was feeding.
31The demons begged Jesus, "If you
drive us out, send us into the herd of
pigs."
32He said to them, "Go!" So they came
out and went into the pigs, and the
whole herd rushed down the steep bank
into the lake and died in the water.
33Those tending the pigs ran off, went
into the town and reported all this,
including what had happened to the
demon-possessed men.
34Then the whole town went out to meet
Jesus. And when they saw him, they
pleaded with him to leave their region.
9Jesus stepped into a boat, crossed
over and came to his own town.
2Some men brought to him a paralytic,
lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their
faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take
heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
3At this, some of the teachers of the law
said to themselves, "This fellow is
blaspheming!"
4Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said,
"Why do you entertain evil thoughts in
your hearts?
5Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are
forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
6But so that you may know that the Son
of Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins...." Then he said to the paralytic,
"Get up, take your mat and go home."
7And the man got up and went home.
8When the crowd saw this, they were
filled with awe; and they praised God,
who had given such authority to men.
9As Jesus went on from there, he saw a
man named Matthew sitting at the tax
collector's booth. "Follow me," he told
him, and Matthew got up and followed
him.
10While Jesus was having dinner at
Matthew's house, many tax collectors
and "sinners" came and ate with him
and his disciples.
11When the Pharisees saw this, they
asked his disciples, "Why does your
teacher eat with tax collectors and
'sinners'?"
12On hearing this, Jesus said, "It is not
the healthy who need a doctor, but the
sick.
13But go and learn what this means: 'I
desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have
not come to call the righteous, but
sinners."
14Then John's disciples came and asked
him, "How is it that we and the
Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not
fast?"
15Jesus answered, "How can the guests
of the bridegroom mourn while he is with
them? The time will come when the
bridegroom will be taken from them;
then they will fast.
16"No one sews a patch of unshrunk
cloth on an old garment, for the patch
will pull away from the garment, making
the tear worse.
17Neither do men pour new wine into old
wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst,
the wine will run out and the wineskins
will be ruined. No, they pour new wine
into new wineskins, and both are
preserved."
18While he was saying this, a ruler came
and knelt before him and said, "My
daughter has just died. But come and
put your hand on her, and she will live."
19Jesus got up and went with him, and
so did his disciples.
20Just then a woman who had been
subject to bleeding for twelve years
came up behind him and touched the
edge of his cloak.
21She said to herself, "If I only touch his
cloak, I will be healed."
22Jesus turned and saw her. "Take heart,
daughter," he said, "your faith has
healed you." And the woman was
healed from that moment.
23When Jesus entered the ruler's house
and saw the flute players and the noisy
crowd,
24he said, "Go away. The girl is not dead
but asleep." But they laughed at him.
25After the crowd had been put outside,
he went in and took the girl by the hand,
and she got up.
26News of this spread through all that
region.
27As Jesus went on from there, two blind
men followed him, calling out, "Have
mercy on us, Son of David!"
28When he had gone indoors, the blind
men came to him, and he asked them,
"Do you believe that I am able to do
this?" "Yes, Lord," they replied.
29Then he touched their eyes and said,
"According to your faith will it be done to
you";
30and their sight was restored. Jesus
warned them sternly, "See that no one
knows about this."
31But they went out and spread the
news about him all over that region.
32While they were going out, a man who
was demon-possessed and could not
talk was brought to Jesus.
33And when the demon was driven out,
the man who had been mute spoke. The
crowd was amazed and said, "Nothing
like this has ever been seen in Israel."
34But the Pharisees said, "It is by the
prince of demons that he drives out
demons."
35Jesus went through all the towns and
villages, teaching in their synagogues,
preaching the good news of the
kingdom and healing every disease and
sickness.
36When he saw the crowds, he had
compassion on them, because they
were harassed and helpless, like sheep
without a shepherd.
37Then he said to his disciples, "The
harvest is plentiful but the workers are
few.
38Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore,
to send out workers into his harvest
field."
10He called his twelve disciples to
him and gave them authority to drive out
evil spirits and to heal every disease
and sickness.
2These are the names of the twelve
apostles: first, Simon (who is called
Peter) and his brother Andrew; James
son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
3Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and
Matthew the tax collector; James son of
Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
4Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot,
who betrayed him.
5These twelve Jesus sent out with the
following instructions: "Do not go among
the Gentiles or enter any town of the
Samaritans.
6Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.
7As you go, preach this message: 'The
kingdom of heaven is near.'
8Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse
those who have leprosy, drive out
demons. Freely you have received,
freely give.
9Do not take along any gold or silver or
copper in your belts;
10take no bag for the journey, or extra
tunic, or sandals or a staff; for the
worker is worth his keep.
11"Whatever town or village you enter,
search for some worthy person there
and stay at his house until you leave.
12As you enter the home, give it your
greeting.
13If the home is deserving, let your
peace rest on it; if it is not, let your
peace return to you.
14If anyone will not welcome you or
listen to your words, shake the dust off
your feet when you leave that home or
town.
15I tell you the truth, it will be more
bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on
the day of judgment than for that town.
16I am sending you out like sheep
among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd
as snakes and as innocent as doves.
17"Be on your guard against men; they
will hand you over to the local councils
and flog you in their synagogues.
18On my account you will be brought
before governors and kings as
witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
19But when they arrest you, do not worry
about what to say or how to say it. At
that time you will be given what to say,
20for it will not be you speaking, but the
Spirit of your Father speaking through
you.
21"Brother will betray brother to death,
and a father his child; children will rebel
against their parents and have them put
to death.
22All men will hate you because of me,
but he who stands firm to the end will be
saved.
23When you are persecuted in one place,
flee to another. I tell you the truth, you
will not finish going through the cities of
Israel before the Son of Man comes.
24"A student is not above his teacher,
nor a servant above his master.
25It is enough for the student to be like
his teacher, and the servant like his
master. If the head of the house has
been called Beelzebub, how much more
the members of his household!
26"So do not be afraid of them. There is
nothing concealed that will not be
disclosed, or hidden that will not be
made known.
27What I tell you in the dark, speak in the
daylight; what is whispered in your ear,
proclaim from the roofs.
28Do not be afraid of those who kill the
body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be
afraid of the One who can destroy both
soul and body in hell.
29Are not two sparrows sold for a
penny ? Yet not one of them will fall to
the ground apart from the will of your
Father.
30And even the very hairs of your head
are all numbered.
31So don't be afraid; you are worth more
than many sparrows.
32"Whoever acknowledges me before
men, I will also acknowledge him before
my Father in heaven.
33But whoever disowns me before men,
I will disown him before my Father in
heaven.
34"Do not suppose that I have come to
bring peace to the earth. I did not come
to bring peace, but a sword.
35For I have come to turn " 'a man
against his father, a daughter against
her mother, a daughter-in-law against
her mother-in-law--
36a man's enemies will be the members
of his own household.'
37"Anyone who loves his father or
mother more than me is not worthy of
me; anyone who loves his son or
daughter more than me is not worthy of
me;
38and anyone who does not take his
cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
39Whoever finds his life will lose it, and
whoever loses his life for my sake will
find it.
40"He who receives you receives me,
and he who receives me receives the
one who sent me.
41Anyone who receives a prophet
because he is a prophet will receive a
prophet's reward, and anyone who
receives a righteous man because he is
a righteous man will receive a righteous
man's reward.
42And if anyone gives even a cup of cold
water to one of these little ones because
he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, he
will certainly not lose his reward."
11After Jesus had finished
instructing his twelve disciples, he went
on from there to teach and preach in the
towns of Galilee.
2When John heard in prison what Christ
was doing, he sent his disciples
3to ask him, "Are you the one who was
to come, or should we expect someone
else?"
4Jesus replied, "Go back and report to
John what you hear and see:
5The blind receive sight, the lame walk,
those who have leprosy are cured, the
deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the
good news is preached to the poor.
6Blessed is the man who does not fall
away on account of me."
7As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus
began to speak to the crowd about
John: "What did you go out into the
desert to see? A reed swayed by the
wind?
8If not, what did you go out to see? A
man dressed in fine clothes? No, those
who wear fine clothes are in kings'
palaces.
9Then what did you go out to see? A
prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than
a prophet.
10This is the one about whom it is
written: " 'I will send my messenger
ahead of you, who will prepare your way
before you.'
11I tell you the truth: Among those born
of women there has not risen anyone
greater than John the Baptist; yet he
who is least in the kingdom of heaven is
greater than he.
12From the days of John the Baptist until
now, the kingdom of heaven has been
forcefully advancing, and forceful men
lay hold of it.
13For all the Prophets and the Law
prophesied until John.
14And if you are willing to accept it, he is
the Elijah who was to come.
15He who has ears, let him hear.
16"To what can I compare this
generation? They are like children sitting
in the marketplaces and calling out to
others:
17" 'We played the flute for you, and you
did not dance; we sang a dirge and you
did not mourn.'
18For John came neither eating nor
drinking, and they say, 'He has a
demon.'
19The Son of Man came eating and
drinking, and they say, 'Here is a glutton
and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors
and "sinners." ' But wisdom is proved
right by her actions."
20Then Jesus began to denounce the
cities in which most of his miracles had
been performed, because they did not
repent.
21"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you,
Bethsaida! If the miracles that were
performed in you had been performed in
Tyre and Sidon, they would have
repented long ago in sackcloth and
ashes.
22But I tell you, it will be more bearable
for Tyre and Sidon on the day of
judgment than for you.
23And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted
up to the skies? No, you will go down to
the depths. If the miracles that were
performed in you had been performed in
Sodom, it would have remained to this
day.
24But I tell you that it will be more
bearable for Sodom on the day of
judgment than for you."
25At that time Jesus said, "I praise you,
Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
because you have hidden these things
from the wise and learned, and revealed
them to little children.
26Yes, Father, for this was your good
pleasure.
27"All things have been committed to me
by my Father. No one knows the Son
except the Father, and no one knows
the Father except the Son and those to
whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
28"Come to me, all you who are weary
and burdened, and I will give you rest.
29Take my yoke upon you and learn
from me, for I am gentle and humble in
heart, and you will find rest for your
souls.
30For my yoke is easy and my burden is
light."
12At that time Jesus went through
the grainfields on the Sabbath. His
disciples were hungry and began to pick
some heads of grain and eat them.
2When the Pharisees saw this, they said
to him, "Look! Your disciples are doing
what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
3He answered, "Haven't you read what
David did when he and his companions
were hungry?
4He entered the house of God, and he
and his companions ate the consecrated
bread--which was not lawful for them to
do, but only for the priests.
5Or haven't you read in the Law that on
the Sabbath the priests in the temple
desecrate the day and yet are innocent?
6I tell you that one greater than the
temple is here.
7If you had known what these words
mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you
would not have condemned the innocent.
8For the Son of Man is Lord of the
Sabbath."
9Going on from that place, he went into
their synagogue,
10and a man with a shriveled hand was
there. Looking for a reason to accuse
Jesus, they asked him, "Is it lawful to
heal on the Sabbath?"
11He said to them, "If any of you has a
sheep and it falls into a pit on the
Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and
lift it out?
12How much more valuable is a man
than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do
good on the Sabbath."
13Then he said to the man, "Stretch out
your hand." So he stretched it out and it
was completely restored, just as sound
as the other.
14But the Pharisees went out and plotted
how they might kill Jesus.
15Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from
that place. Many followed him, and he
healed all their sick,
16warning them not to tell who he was.
17This was to fulfill what was spoken
through the prophet Isaiah:
18"Here is my servant whom I have
chosen, the one I love, in whom I
delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and
he will proclaim justice to the nations.
19He will not quarrel or cry out; no one
will hear his voice in the streets.
20A bruised reed he will not break, and a
smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till
he leads justice to victory.
21In his name the nations will put their
hope."
22Then they brought him a demonpossessed
man who was blind and
mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he
could both talk and see.
23All the people were astonished and
said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
24But when the Pharisees heard this,
they said, "It is only by Beelzebub, the
prince of demons, that this fellow drives
out demons."
25Jesus knew their thoughts and said to
them, "Every kingdom divided against
itself will be ruined, and every city or
household divided against itself will not
stand.
26If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided
against himself. How then can his
kingdom stand?
27And if I drive out demons by
Beelzebub, by whom do your people
drive them out? So then, they will be
your judges.
28But if I drive out demons by the Spirit
of God, then the kingdom of God has
come upon you.
29"Or again, how can anyone enter a
strong man's house and carry off his
possessions unless he first ties up the
strong man? Then he can rob his house.
30"He who is not with me is against me,
and he who does not gather with me
scatters.
31And so I tell you, every sin and
blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the
blasphemy against the Spirit will not be
forgiven.
32Anyone who speaks a word against
the Son of Man will be forgiven, but
anyone who speaks against the Holy
Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this
age or in the age to come.
33"Make a tree good and its fruit will be
good, or make a tree bad and its fruit
will be bad, for a tree is recognized by
its fruit.
34You brood of vipers, how can you who
are evil say anything good? For out of
the overflow of the heart the mouth
speaks.
35The good man brings good things out
of the good stored up in him, and the
evil man brings evil things out of the evil
stored up in him.
36But I tell you that men will have to give
account on the day of judgment for
every careless word they have spoken.
37For by your words you will be
acquitted, and by your words you will be
condemned."
38Then some of the Pharisees and
teachers of the law said to him,
"Teacher, we want to see a miraculous
sign from you."
39He answered, "A wicked and
adulterous generation asks for a
miraculous sign! But none will be given
it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
40For as Jonah was three days and
three nights in the belly of a huge fish,
so the Son of Man will be three days
and three nights in the heart of the earth.
41The men of Nineveh will stand up at
the judgment with this generation and
condemn it; for they repented at the
preaching of Jonah, and now one
greater than Jonah is here.
42The Queen of the South will rise at the
judgment with this generation and
condemn it; for she came from the ends
of the earth to listen to Solomon's
wisdom, and now one greater than
Solomon is here.
43"When an evil spirit comes out of a
man, it goes through arid places seeking
rest and does not find it.
44Then it says, 'I will return to the house
I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house
unoccupied, swept clean and put in
order.
45Then it goes and takes with it seven
other spirits more wicked than itself, and
they go in and live there. And the final
condition of that man is worse than the
first. That is how it will be with this
wicked generation."
46While Jesus was still talking to the
crowd, his mother and brothers stood
outside, wanting to speak to him.
47Someone told him, "Your mother and
brothers are standing outside, wanting
to speak to you."
48He replied to him, "Who is my mother,
and who are my brothers?"
49Pointing to his disciples, he said, "Here
are my mother and my brothers.
50For whoever does the will of my Father
in heaven is my brother and sister and
mother."
13That same day Jesus went out of
the house and sat by the lake.
2Such large crowds gathered around
him that he got into a boat and sat in it,
while all the people stood on the shore.
3Then he told them many things in
parables, saying: "A farmer went out to
sow his seed.
4As he was scattering the seed, some
fell along the path, and the birds came
and ate it up.
5Some fell on rocky places, where it did
not have much soil. It sprang up quickly,
because the soil was shallow.
6But when the sun came up, the plants
were scorched, and they withered
because they had no root.
7Other seed fell among thorns, which
grew up and choked the plants.
8Still other seed fell on good soil, where
it produced a crop--a hundred, sixty or
thirty times what was sown.
9He who has ears, let him hear."
10The disciples came to him and asked,
"Why do you speak to the people in
parables?"
11He replied, "The knowledge of the
secrets of the kingdom of heaven has
been given to you, but not to them.
12Whoever has will be given more, and
he will have an abundance. Whoever
does not have, even what he has will be
taken from him.
13This is why I speak to them in
parables: "Though seeing, they do not
see; though hearing, they do not hear or
understand.
14In them is fulfilled the prophecy of
Isaiah: " 'You will be ever hearing but
never understanding; you will be ever
seeing but never perceiving.
15For this people's heart has become
calloused; they hardly hear with their
ears, and they have closed their eyes.
Otherwise they might see with their eyes,
hear with their ears, understand with
their hearts and turn, and I would heal
them.'
16But blessed are your eyes because
they see, and your ears because they
hear.
17For I tell you the truth, many prophets
and righteous men longed to see what
you see but did not see it, and to hear
what you hear but did not hear it.
18"Listen then to what the parable of the
sower means:
19When anyone hears the message
about the kingdom and does not
understand it, the evil one comes and
snatches away what was sown in his
heart. This is the seed sown along the
path.
20The one who received the seed that
fell on rocky places is the man who
hears the word and at once receives it
with joy.
21But since he has no root, he lasts only
a short time. When trouble or
persecution comes because of the word,
he quickly falls away.
22The one who received the seed that
fell among the thorns is the man who
hears the word, but the worries of this
life and the deceitfulness of wealth
choke it, making it unfruitful.
23But the one who received the seed
that fell on good soil is the man who
hears the word and understands it. He
produces a crop, yielding a hundred,
sixty or thirty times what was sown."
24Jesus told them another parable: "The
kingdom of heaven is like a man who
sowed good seed in his field.
25But while everyone was sleeping, his
enemy came and sowed weeds among
the wheat, and went away.
26When the wheat sprouted and formed
heads, then the weeds also appeared.
27"The owner's servants came to him
and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed
in your field? Where then did the weeds
come from?'
28" 'An enemy did this,' he replied. "The
servants asked him, 'Do you want us to
go and pull them up?'
29" 'No,' he answered, 'because while
you are pulling the weeds, you may root
up the wheat with them.
30Let both grow together until the
harvest. At that time I will tell the
harvesters: First collect the weeds and
tie them in bundles to be burned; then
gather the wheat and bring it into my
barn.' "
31He told them another parable: "The
kingdom of heaven is like a mustard
seed, which a man took and planted in
his field.
32Though it is the smallest of all your
seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest
of garden plants and becomes a tree, so
that the birds of the air come and perch
in its branches."
33He told them still another parable:
"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast
that a woman took and mixed into a
large amount of flour until it worked all
through the dough."
34Jesus spoke all these things to the
crowd in parables; he did not say
anything to them without using a parable.
35So was fulfilled what was spoken
through the prophet: "I will open my
mouth in parables, I will utter things
hidden since the creation of the world."
36Then he left the crowd and went into
the house. His disciples came to him
and said, "Explain to us the parable of
the weeds in the field."
37He answered, "The one who sowed
the good seed is the Son of Man.
38The field is the world, and the good
seed stands for the sons of the kingdom.
The weeds are the sons of the evil one,
39and the enemy who sows them is the
devil. The harvest is the end of the age,
and the harvesters are angels.
40"As the weeds are pulled up and
burned in the fire, so it will be at the end
of the age.
41The Son of Man will send out his
angels, and they will weed out of his
kingdom everything that causes sin and
all who do evil.
42They will throw them into the fiery
furnace, where there will be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.
43Then the righteous will shine like the
sun in the kingdom of their Father. He
who has ears, let him hear.
44"The kingdom of heaven is like
treasure hidden in a field. When a man
found it, he hid it again, and then in his
joy went and sold all he had and bought
that field.
45"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a
merchant looking for fine pearls.
46When he found one of great value, he
went away and sold everything he had
and bought it.
47"Once again, the kingdom of heaven is
like a net that was let down into the lake
and caught all kinds of fish.
48When it was full, the fishermen pulled
it up on the shore. Then they sat down
and collected the good fish in baskets,
but threw the bad away.
49This is how it will be at the end of the
age. The angels will come and separate
the wicked from the righteous
50and throw them into the fiery furnace,
where there will be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.
51"Have you understood all these
things?" Jesus asked. "Yes," they
replied.
52He said to them, "Therefore every
teacher of the law who has been
instructed about the kingdom of heaven
is like the owner of a house who brings
out of his storeroom new treasures as
well as old."
53When Jesus had finished these
parables, he moved on from there.
54Coming to his hometown, he began
teaching the people in their synagogue,
and they were amazed. "Where did this
man get this wisdom and these
miraculous powers?" they asked.
55"Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his
mother's name Mary, and aren't his
brothers James, Joseph, Simon and
Judas?
56Aren't all his sisters with us? Where
then did this man get all these things?"
57And they took offense at him. But
Jesus said to them, "Only in his
hometown and in his own house is a
prophet without honor."
58And he did not do many miracles there
because of their lack of faith.
14At that time Herod the tetrarch
heard the reports about Jesus,
2and he said to his attendants, "This is
John the Baptist; he has risen from the
dead! That is why miraculous powers
are at work in him."
3Now Herod had arrested John and
bound him and put him in prison
because of Herodias, his brother Philip's
wife,
4for John had been saying to him: "It is
not lawful for you to have her."
5Herod wanted to kill John, but he was
afraid of the people, because they
considered him a prophet.
6On Herod's birthday the daughter of
Herodias danced for them and pleased
Herod so much
7that he promised with an oath to give
her whatever she asked.
8Prompted by her mother, she said,
"Give me here on a platter the head of
John the Baptist."
9The king was distressed, but because
of his oaths and his dinner guests, he
ordered that her request be granted
10and had John beheaded in the prison.
11His head was brought in on a platter
and given to the girl, who carried it to
her mother.
12John's disciples came and took his
body and buried it. Then they went and
told Jesus.
13When Jesus heard what had
happened, he withdrew by boat privately
to a solitary place. Hearing of this, the
crowds followed him on foot from the
towns.
14When Jesus landed and saw a large
crowd, he had compassion on them and
healed their sick.
15As evening approached, the disciples
came to him and said, "This is a remote
place, and it's already getting late. Send
the crowds away, so they can go to the
villages and buy themselves some
food."
16Jesus replied, "They do not need to go
away. You give them something to eat."
17"We have here only five loaves of
bread and two fish," they answered.
18"Bring them here to me," he said.
19And he directed the people to sit down
on the grass. Taking the five loaves and
the two fish and looking up to heaven,
he gave thanks and broke the loaves.
Then he gave them to the disciples, and
the disciples gave them to the people.
20They all ate and were satisfied, and
the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls
of broken pieces that were left over.
21The number of those who ate was
about five thousand men, besides
women and children.
22Immediately Jesus made the disciples
get into the boat and go on ahead of him
to the other side, while he dismissed the
crowd.
23After he had dismissed them, he went
up on a mountainside by himself to pray.
When evening came, he was there
alone,
24but the boat was already a
considerable distance from land,
buffeted by the waves because the wind
was against it.
25During the fourth watch of the night
Jesus went out to them, walking on the
lake.
26When the disciples saw him walking
on the lake, they were terrified. "It's a
ghost," they said, and cried out in fear.
27But Jesus immediately said to them:
"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."
28"Lord, if it's you," Peter replied, "tell me
to come to you on the water."
29"Come," he said.
30Then Peter got down out of the boat,
walked on the water and came toward
Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he
was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried
out, "Lord, save me!"
31Immediately Jesus reached out his
hand and caught him. "You of little faith,"
he said, "why did you doubt?"
32And when they climbed into the boat,
the wind died down.
33Then those who were in the boat
worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are
the Son of God."
34When they had crossed over, they
landed at Gennesaret.
35And when the men of that place
recognized Jesus, they sent word to all
the surrounding country. People brought
all their sick to him
36and begged him to let the sick just
touch the edge of his cloak, and all who
touched him were healed.
15Then some Pharisees and
teachers of the law came to Jesus from
Jerusalem and asked,
2"Why do your disciples break the
tradition of the elders? They don't wash
their hands before they eat!"
3Jesus replied, "And why do you break
the command of God for the sake of
your tradition?
4For God said, 'Honor your father and
mother' and 'Anyone who curses his
father or mother must be put to death.'
5But you say that if a man says to his
father or mother, 'Whatever help you
might otherwise have received from me
is a gift devoted to God,'
6he is not to 'honor his father ' with it.
Thus you nullify the word of God for the
sake of your tradition.
7You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when
he prophesied about you:
8" 'These people honor me with their lips,
but their hearts are far from me.
9They worship me in vain; their
teachings are but rules taught by men.' "
10Jesus called the crowd to him and said,
"Listen and understand.
11What goes into a man's mouth does
not make him 'unclean,' but what comes
out of his mouth, that is what makes him
'unclean.' "
12Then the disciples came to him and
asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees
were offended when they heard this?"
13He replied, "Every plant that my
heavenly Father has not planted will be
pulled up by the roots.
14Leave them; they are blind guides. If a
blind man leads a blind man, both will
fall into a pit."
15Peter said, "Explain the parable to us."
16"Are you still so dull?" Jesus asked
them.
17"Don't you see that whatever enters
the mouth goes into the stomach and
then out of the body?
18But the things that come out of the
mouth come from the heart, and these
make a man 'unclean.'
19For out of the heart come evil thoughts,
murder, adultery, sexual immorality,
theft, false testimony, slander.
20These are what make a man 'unclean';
but eating with unwashed hands does
not make him 'unclean.' "
21Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to
the region of Tyre and Sidon.
22A Canaanite woman from that vicinity
came to him, crying out, "Lord, Son of
David, have mercy on me! My daughter
is suffering terribly from demonpossession."
23Jesus did not answer a word. So his
disciples came to him and urged him,
"Send her away, for she keeps crying
out after us."
24He answered, "I was sent only to the
lost sheep of Israel."
25The woman came and knelt before
him. "Lord, help me!" she said.
26He replied, "It is not right to take the
children's bread and toss it to their
dogs."
27"Yes, Lord," she said, "but even the
dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their
masters' table."
28Then Jesus answered, "Woman, you
have great faith! Your request is
granted." And her daughter was healed
from that very hour.
29Jesus left there and went along the
Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a
mountainside and sat down.
30Great crowds came to him, bringing
the lame, the blind, the crippled, the
mute and many others, and laid them at
his feet; and he healed them.
31The people were amazed when they
saw the mute speaking, the crippled
made well, the lame walking and the
blind seeing. And they praised the God
of Israel.
32Jesus called his disciples to him and
said, "I have compassion for these
people; they have already been with me
three days and have nothing to eat. I do
not want to send them away hungry, or
they may collapse on the way."
33His disciples answered, "Where could
we get enough bread in this remote
place to feed such a crowd?"
34"How many loaves do you have?"
Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied, "and
a few small fish."
35He told the crowd to sit down on the
ground.
36Then he took the seven loaves and the
fish, and when he had given thanks, he
broke them and gave them to the
disciples, and they in turn to the people.
37They all ate and were satisfied.
Afterward the disciples picked up seven
basketfuls of broken pieces that were
left over.
38The number of those who ate was four
thousand, besides women and children.
39After Jesus had sent the crowd away,
he got into the boat and went to the
vicinity of Magadan.
16The Pharisees and Sadducees
came to Jesus and tested him by asking
him to show them a sign from heaven.
2He replied, "When evening comes, you
say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is
red,'
3and in the morning, 'Today it will be
stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.'
You know how to interpret the
appearance of the sky, but you cannot
interpret the signs of the times.
4A wicked and adulterous generation
looks for a miraculous sign, but none will
be given it except the sign of Jonah."
Jesus then left them and went away.
5When they went across the lake, the
disciples forgot to take bread.
6"Be careful," Jesus said to them. "Be on
your guard against the yeast of the
Pharisees and Sadducees."
7They discussed this among themselves
and said, "It is because we didn't bring
any bread."
8Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked,
"You of little faith, why are you talking
among yourselves about having no
bread?
9Do you still not understand? Don't you
remember the five loaves for the five
thousand, and how many basketfuls you
gathered?
10Or the seven loaves for the four
thousand, and how many basketfuls you
gathered?
11How is it you don't understand that I
was not talking to you about bread? But
be on your guard against the yeast of
the Pharisees and Sadducees."
12Then they understood that he was not
telling them to guard against the yeast
used in bread, but against the teaching
of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
13When Jesus came to the region of
Caesarea Philippi, he asked his
disciples, "Who do people say the Son
of Man is?"
14They replied, "Some say John the
Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others,
Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
15"But what about you?" he asked. "Who
do you say I am?"
16Simon Peter answered, "You are the
Christ, the Son of the living God."
17Jesus replied, "Blessed are you,
Simon son of Jonah, for this was not
revealed to you by man, but by my
Father in heaven.
18And I tell you that you are Peter, and
on this rock I will build my church, and
the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
19I will give you the keys of the kingdom
of heaven; whatever you bind on earth
will be bound in heaven, and whatever
you loose on earth will be loosed in
heaven."
20Then he warned his disciples not to tell
anyone that he was the Christ.
21From that time on Jesus began to
explain to his disciples that he must go
to Jerusalem and suffer many things at
the hands of the elders, chief priests
and teachers of the law, and that he
must be killed and on the third day be
raised to life.
22Peter took him aside and began to
rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said.
"This shall never happen to you!"
23Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get
behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling
block to me; you do not have in mind the
things of God, but the things of men."
24Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If
anyone would come after me, he must
deny himself and take up his cross and
follow me.
25For whoever wants to save his life will
lose it, but whoever loses his life for me
will find it.
26What good will it be for a man if he
gains the whole world, yet forfeits his
soul? Or what can a man give in
exchange for his soul?
27For the Son of Man is going to come in
his Father's glory with his angels, and
then he will reward each person
according to what he has done.
28I tell you the truth, some who are
standing here will not taste death before
they see the Son of Man coming in his
kingdom."
17After six days Jesus took with him
Peter, James and John the brother of
James, and led them up a high
mountain by themselves.
2There he was transfigured before them.
His face shone like the sun, and his
clothes became as white as the light.
3Just then there appeared before them
Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.
4Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for
us to be here. If you wish, I will put up
three shelters--one for you, one for
Moses and one for Elijah."
5While he was still speaking, a bright
cloud enveloped them, and a voice from
the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I
love; with him I am well pleased. Listen
to him!"
6When the disciples heard this, they fell
facedown to the ground, terrified.
7But Jesus came and touched them.
"Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."
8When they looked up, they saw no one
except Jesus.
9As they were coming down the
mountain, Jesus instructed them, "Don't
tell anyone what you have seen, until
the Son of Man has been raised from
the dead."
10The disciples asked him, "Why then do
the teachers of the law say that Elijah
must come first?"
11Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah
comes and will restore all things.
12But I tell you, Elijah has already come,
and they did not recognize him, but
have done to him everything they
wished. In the same way the Son of
Man is going to suffer at their hands."
13Then the disciples understood that he
was talking to them about John the
Baptist.
14When they came to the crowd, a man
approached Jesus and knelt before him.
15"Lord, have mercy on my son," he said.
"He has seizures and is suffering greatly.
He often falls into the fire or into the
water.
16I brought him to your disciples, but
they could not heal him."
17"O unbelieving and perverse
generation," Jesus replied, "how long
shall I stay with you? How long shall I
put up with you? Bring the boy here to
me."
18Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came
out of the boy, and he was healed from
that moment.
19Then the disciples came to Jesus in
private and asked, "Why couldn't we
drive it out?"
20He replied, "Because you have so little
faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith
as small as a mustard seed, you can
say to this mountain, 'Move from here to
there' and it will move. Nothing will be
impossible for you."
22When they came together in Galilee,
he said to them, "The Son of Man is
going to be betrayed into the hands of
men.
23They will kill him, and on the third day
he will be raised to life." And the
disciples were filled with grief.
24After Jesus and his disciples arrived in
Capernaum, the collectors of the twodrachma
tax came to Peter and asked,
"Doesn't your teacher pay the temple
tax ?"
25"Yes, he does," he replied. When
Peter came into the house, Jesus was
the first to speak. "What do you think,
Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the
kings of the earth collect duty and taxes-
-from their own sons or from others?"
26"From others," Peter answered.
27"Then the sons are exempt," Jesus
said to him. "But so that we may not
offend them, go to the lake and throw
out your line. Take the first fish you
catch; open its mouth and you will find a
four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to
them for my tax and yours."
18At that time the disciples came to
Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest
in the kingdom of heaven?"
2He called a little child and had him
stand among them.
3And he said: "I tell you the truth, unless
you change and become like little
children, you will never enter the
kingdom of heaven.
4Therefore, whoever humbles himself
like this child is the greatest in the
kingdom of heaven.
5"And whoever welcomes a little child
like this in my name welcomes me.
6But if anyone causes one of these little
ones who believe in me to sin, it would
be better for him to have a large
millstone hung around his neck and to
be drowned in the depths of the sea.
7"Woe to the world because of the
things that cause people to sin! Such
things must come, but woe to the man
through whom they come!
8If your hand or your foot causes you to
sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is
better for you to enter life maimed or
crippled than to have two hands or two
feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
9And if your eye causes you to sin,
gouge it out and throw it away. It is
better for you to enter life with one eye
than to have two eyes and be thrown
into the fire of hell.
10"See that you do not look down on one
of these little ones. For I tell you that
their angels in heaven always see the
face of my Father in heaven.
12"What do you think? If a man owns a
hundred sheep, and one of them
wanders away, will he not leave the
ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for
the one that wandered off?
13And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he
is happier about that one sheep than
about the ninety-nine that did not
wander off.
14In the same way your Father in
heaven is not willing that any of these
little ones should be lost.
15"If your brother sins against you, go
and show him his fault, just between the
two of you. If he listens to you, you have
won your brother over.
16But if he will not listen, take one or two
others along, so that 'every matter may
be established by the testimony of two
or three witnesses.'
17If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to
the church; and if he refuses to listen
even to the church, treat him as you
would a pagan or a tax collector.
18"I tell you the truth, whatever you bind
on earth will be bound in heaven, and
whatever you loose on earth will be
loosed in heaven.
19"Again, I tell you that if two of you on
earth agree about anything you ask for,
it will be done for you by my Father in
heaven.
20For where two or three come together
in my name, there am I with them."
21Then Peter came to Jesus and asked,
"Lord, how many times shall I forgive my
brother when he sins against me? Up to
seven times?"
22Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven
times, but seventy-seven times.
23"Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is
like a king who wanted to settle
accounts with his servants.
24As he began the settlement, a man
who owed him ten thousand talents was
brought to him.
25Since he was not able to pay, the
master ordered that he and his wife and
his children and all that he had be sold
to repay the debt.
26"The servant fell on his knees before
him. 'Be patient with me,' he begged,
'and I will pay back everything.'
27The servant's master took pity on him,
canceled the debt and let him go.
28"But when that servant went out, he
found one of his fellow servants who
owed him a hundred denarii. He
grabbed him and began to choke him.
'Pay back what you owe me!' he
demanded.
29"His fellow servant fell to his knees
and begged him, 'Be patient with me,
and I will pay you back.'
30"But he refused. Instead, he went off
and had the man thrown into prison until
he could pay the debt.
31When the other servants saw what
had happened, they were greatly
distressed and went and told their
master everything that had happened.
32"Then the master called the servant in.
'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I
canceled all that debt of yours because
you begged me to.
33Shouldn't you have had mercy on your
fellow servant just as I had on you?'
34In anger his master turned him over to
the jailers to be tortured, until he should
pay back all he owed.
35"This is how my heavenly Father will
treat each of you unless you forgive
your brother from your heart."
19When Jesus had finished saying
these things, he left Galilee and went
into the region of Judea to the other side
of the Jordan.
2Large crowds followed him, and he
healed them there.
3Some Pharisees came to him to test
him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man
to divorce his wife for any and every
reason?"
4"Haven't you read," he replied, "that at
the beginning the Creator 'made them
male and female,'
5and said, 'For this reason a man will
leave his father and mother and be
united to his wife, and the two will
become one flesh' ?
6So they are no longer two, but one.
Therefore what God has joined together,
let man not separate."
7"Why then," they asked, "did Moses
command that a man give his wife a
certificate of divorce and send her
away?"
8Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to
divorce your wives because your hearts
were hard. But it was not this way from
the beginning.
9I tell you that anyone who divorces his
wife, except for marital unfaithfulness,
and marries another woman commits
adultery."
10The disciples said to him, "If this is the
situation between a husband and wife, it
is better not to marry."
11Jesus replied, "Not everyone can
accept this word, but only those to
whom it has been given.
12For some are eunuchs because they
were born that way; others were made
that way by men; and others have
renounced marriage because of the
kingdom of heaven. The one who can
accept this should accept it."
13Then little children were brought to
Jesus for him to place his hands on
them and pray for them. But the
disciples rebuked those who brought
them.
14Jesus said, "Let the little children come
to me, and do not hinder them, for the
kingdom of heaven belongs to such as
these."
15When he had placed his hands on
them, he went on from there.
16Now a man came up to Jesus and
asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I
do to get eternal life?"
17"Why do you ask me about what is
good?" Jesus replied. "There is only
One who is good. If you want to enter
life, obey the commandments."
18"Which ones?" the man inquired.
19Jesus replied, " 'Do not murder, do not
commit adultery, do not steal, do not
give false testimony, honor your father
and mother,' and 'love your neighbor as
yourself.' "
20"All these I have kept," the young man
said. "What do I still lack?"
21Jesus answered, "If you want to be
perfect, go, sell your possessions and
give to the poor, and you will have
treasure in heaven. Then come, follow
me."
22When the young man heard this, he
went away sad, because he had great
wealth.
23Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell
you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of heaven.
24Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel
to go through the eye of a needle than
for a rich man to enter the kingdom of
God."
25When the disciples heard this, they
were greatly astonished and asked,
"Who then can be saved?"
26Jesus looked at them and said, "With
man this is impossible, but with God all
things are possible."
27Peter answered him, "We have left
everything to follow you! What then will
there be for us?"
28Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth,
at the renewal of all things, when the
Son of Man sits on his glorious throne,
you who have followed me will also sit
on twelve thrones, judging the twelve
tribes of Israel.
29And everyone who has left houses or
brothers or sisters or father or mother or
children or fields for my sake will receive
a hundred times as much and will inherit
eternal life.
30But many who are first will be last, and
many who are last will be first.
20"For the kingdom of heaven is like
a landowner who went out early in the
morning to hire men to work in his
vineyard.
2He agreed to pay them a denarius for
the day and sent them into his vineyard.
3"About the third hour he went out and
saw others standing in the marketplace
doing nothing.
4He told them, 'You also go and work in
my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever
is right.'
5So they went.
6"He went out again about the sixth hour
and the ninth hour and did the same
thing. About the eleventh hour he went
out and found still others standing
around. He asked them, 'Why have you
been standing here all day long doing
nothing?'
7" 'Because no one has hired us,' they
answered. "He said to them, 'You also
go and work in my vineyard.'
8"When evening came, the owner of the
vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the
workers and pay them their wages,
beginning with the last ones hired and
going on to the first.'
9"The workers who were hired about the
eleventh hour came and each received
a denarius.
10So when those came who were hired
first, they expected to receive more. But
each one of them also received a
denarius.
11When they received it, they began to
grumble against the landowner.
12'These men who were hired last
worked only one hour,' they said, 'and
you have made them equal to us who
have borne the burden of the work and
the heat of the day.'
13"But he answered one of them, 'Friend,
I am not being unfair to you. Didn't you
agree to work for a denarius?
14Take your pay and go. I want to give
the man who was hired last the same as
I gave you.
15Don't I have the right to do what I want
with my own money? Or are you
envious because I am generous?'
16"So the last will be first, and the first
will be last."
17Now as Jesus was going up to
Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples
aside and said to them,
18"We are going up to Jerusalem, and
the Son of Man will be betrayed to the
chief priests and the teachers of the law.
They will condemn him to death
19and will turn him over to the Gentiles
to be mocked and flogged and crucified.
On the third day he will be raised to life!"
20Then the mother of Zebedee's sons
came to Jesus with her sons and,
kneeling down, asked a favor of him.
21"What is it you want?" he asked. She
said, "Grant that one of these two sons
of mine may sit at your right and the
other at your left in your kingdom."
22"You don't know what you are asking,"
Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the
cup I am going to drink?" "We can," they
answered.
23Jesus said to them, "You will indeed
drink from my cup, but to sit at my right
or left is not for me to grant. These
places belong to those for whom they
have been prepared by my Father."
24When the ten heard about this, they
were indignant with the two brothers.
25Jesus called them together and said,
"You know that the rulers of the Gentiles
lord it over them, and their high officials
exercise authority over them.
26Not so with you. Instead, whoever
wants to become great among you must
be your servant,
27and whoever wants to be first must be
your slave--
28just as the Son of Man did not come to
be served, but to serve, and to give his
life as a ransom for many."
29As Jesus and his disciples were
leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed
him.
30Two blind men were sitting by the
roadside, and when they heard that
Jesus was going by, they shouted, "Lord,
Son of David, have mercy on us!"
31The crowd rebuked them and told
them to be quiet, but they shouted all
the louder, "Lord, Son of David, have
mercy on us!"
32Jesus stopped and called them. "What
do you want me to do for you?" he
asked.
33"Lord," they answered, "we want our
sight."
34Jesus had compassion on them and
touched their eyes. Immediately they
received their sight and followed him.
21As they approached Jerusalem
and came to Bethphage on the Mount of
Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
2saying to them, "Go to the village
ahead of you, and at once you will find a
donkey tied there, with her colt by her.
Untie them and bring them to me.
3If anyone says anything to you, tell him
that the Lord needs them, and he will
send them right away."
4This took place to fulfill what was
spoken through the prophet:
5"Say to the Daughter of Zion, 'See, your
king comes to you, gentle and riding on
a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a
donkey.' "
6The disciples went and did as Jesus
had instructed them.
7They brought the donkey and the colt,
placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus
sat on them.
8A very large crowd spread their cloaks
on the road, while others cut branches
from the trees and spread them on the
road.
9The crowds that went ahead of him and
those that followed shouted, "Hosanna
to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who
comes in the name of the Lord!"
"Hosanna in the highest!"
10When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the
whole city was stirred and asked, "Who
is this?"
11The crowds answered, "This is Jesus,
the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee."
12Jesus entered the temple area and
drove out all who were buying and
selling there. He overturned the tables
of the money changers and the benches
of those selling doves.
13"It is written," he said to them, " 'My
house will be called a house of prayer,'
but you are making it a 'den of robbers.'
"
14The blind and the lame came to him at
the temple, and he healed them.
15But when the chief priests and the
teachers of the law saw the wonderful
things he did and the children shouting
in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son
of David," they were indignant.
16"Do you hear what these children are
saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied
Jesus, "have you never read, " 'From
the lips of children and infants you have
ordained praise' ?"
17And he left them and went out of the
city to Bethany, where he spent the
night.
18Early in the morning, as he was on his
way back to the city, he was hungry.
19Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went
up to it but found nothing on it except
leaves. Then he said to it, "May you
never bear fruit again!" Immediately the
tree withered.
20When the disciples saw this, they were
amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so
quickly?" they asked.
21Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, if
you have faith and do not doubt, not
only can you do what was done to the
fig tree, but also you can say to this
mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the
sea,' and it will be done.
22If you believe, you will receive
whatever you ask for in prayer."
23Jesus entered the temple courts, and,
while he was teaching, the chief priests
and the elders of the people came to
him. "By what authority are you doing
these things?" they asked. "And who
gave you this authority?"
24Jesus replied, "I will also ask you one
question. If you answer me, I will tell you
by what authority I am doing these
things.
25John's baptism--where did it come
from? Was it from heaven, or from
men?"
26They discussed it among themselves
and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he
will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe
him?' But if we say, 'From men'--we are
afraid of the people, for they all hold that
John was a prophet."
27So they answered Jesus, "We don't
know." Then he said, "Neither will I tell
you by what authority I am doing these
things.
28"What do you think? There was a man
who had two sons. He went to the first
and said, 'Son, go and work today in the
vineyard.'
29" 'I will not,' he answered, but later he
changed his mind and went.
30"Then the father went to the other son
and said the same thing. He answered,
'I will, sir,' but he did not go.
31"Which of the two did what his father
wanted?" "The first," they answered.
32Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth,
the tax collectors and the prostitutes are
entering the kingdom of God ahead of
you. For John came to you to show you
the way of righteousness, and you did
not believe him, but the tax collectors
and the prostitutes did. And even after
you saw this, you did not repent and
believe him.
33"Listen to another parable: There was
a landowner who planted a vineyard. He
put a wall around it, dug a winepress in
it and built a watchtower. Then he
rented the vineyard to some farmers
and went away on a journey.
34When the harvest time approached, he
sent his servants to the tenants to
collect his fruit.
35"The tenants seized his servants; they
beat one, killed another, and stoned a
third.
36Then he sent other servants to them,
more than the first time, and the tenants
treated them the same way.
37Last of all, he sent his son to them.
'They will respect my son,' he said.
38"But when the tenants saw the son,
they said to each other, 'This is the heir.
Come, let's kill him and take his
inheritance.'
39So they took him and threw him out of
the vineyard and killed him.
40"Therefore, when the owner of the
vineyard comes, what will he do to those
tenants?"
41"He will bring those wretches to a
wretched end," they replied, "and he will
rent the vineyard to other tenants, who
will give him his share of the crop at
harvest time."
42Jesus said to them, "Have you never
read in the Scriptures: " 'The stone the
builders rejected has become the
capstone ; the Lord has done this, and it
is marvelous in our eyes' ?
43"Therefore I tell you that the kingdom
of God will be taken away from you and
given to a people who will produce its
fruit.
44He who falls on this stone will be
broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls
will be crushed."
45When the chief priests and the
Pharisees heard Jesus' parables, they
knew he was talking about them.
46They looked for a way to arrest him,
but they were afraid of the crowd
because the people held that he was a
prophet.
22Jesus spoke to them again in
parables, saying:
2"The kingdom of heaven is like a king
who prepared a wedding banquet for his
son.
3He sent his servants to those who had
been invited to the banquet to tell them
to come, but they refused to come.
4"Then he sent some more servants and
said, 'Tell those who have been invited
that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen
and fattened cattle have been butchered,
and everything is ready. Come to the
wedding banquet.'
5"But they paid no attention and went
off--one to his field, another to his
business.
6The rest seized his servants,
mistreated them and killed them.
7The king was enraged. He sent his
army and destroyed those murderers
and burned their city.
8"Then he said to his servants, 'The
wedding banquet is ready, but those I
invited did not deserve to come.
9Go to the street corners and invite to
the banquet anyone you find.'
10So the servants went out into the
streets and gathered all the people they
could find, both good and bad, and the
wedding hall was filled with guests.
11"But when the king came in to see the
guests, he noticed a man there who was
not wearing wedding clothes.
12'Friend,' he asked, 'how did you get in
here without wedding clothes?' The man
was speechless.
13"Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie
him hand and foot, and throw him
outside, into the darkness, where there
will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
14"For many are invited, but few are
chosen."
15Then the Pharisees went out and laid
plans to trap him in his words.
16They sent their disciples to him along
with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said,
"we know you are a man of integrity and
that you teach the way of God in
accordance with the truth. You aren't
swayed by men, because you pay no
attention to who they are.
17Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it
right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
18But Jesus, knowing their evil intent,
said, "You hypocrites, why are you
trying to trap me?
19Show me the coin used for paying the
tax." They brought him a denarius,
20and he asked them, "Whose portrait is
this? And whose inscription?"
21"Caesar's," they replied. Then he said
to them, "Give to Caesar what is
Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
22When they heard this, they were
amazed. So they left him and went away.
23That same day the Sadducees, who
say there is no resurrection, came to
him with a question.
24"Teacher," they said, "Moses told us
that if a man dies without having
children, his brother must marry the
widow and have children for him.
25Now there were seven brothers among
us. The first one married and died, and
since he had no children, he left his wife
to his brother.
26The same thing happened to the
second and third brother, right on down
to the seventh.
27Finally, the woman died.
28Now then, at the resurrection, whose
wife will she be of the seven, since all of
them were married to her?"
29Jesus replied, "You are in error
because you do not know the Scriptures
or the power of God.
30At the resurrection people will neither
marry nor be given in marriage; they will
be like the angels in heaven.
31But about the resurrection of the dead-
-have you not read what God said to
you,
32'I am the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob' ? He is not
the God of the dead but of the living."
33When the crowds heard this, they
were astonished at his teaching.
34Hearing that Jesus had silenced the
Sadducees, the Pharisees got together.
35One of them, an expert in the law,
tested him with this question:
36"Teacher, which is the greatest
commandment in the Law?"
37Jesus replied: " 'Love the Lord your
God with all your heart and with all your
soul and with all your mind.'
38This is the first and greatest
commandment.
39And the second is like it: 'Love your
neighbor as yourself.'
40All the Law and the Prophets hang on
these two commandments."
41While the Pharisees were gathered
together, Jesus asked them,
42"What do you think about the Christ ?
Whose son is he?" "The son of David,"
they replied.
43He said to them, "How is it then that
David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him
'Lord'? For he says,
44" 'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my
right hand until I put your enemies under
your feet." '
45If then David calls him 'Lord,' how can
he be his son?"
46No one could say a word in reply, and
from that day on no one dared to ask
him any more questions.
23Then Jesus said to the crowds
and to his disciples:
2"The teachers of the law and the
Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.
3So you must obey them and do
everything they tell you. But do not do
what they do, for they do not practice
what they preach.
4They tie up heavy loads and put them
on men's shoulders, but they
themselves are not willing to lift a finger
to move them.
5"Everything they do is done for men to
see: They make their phylacteries wide
and the tassels on their garments long;
6they love the place of honor at
banquets and the most important seats
in the synagogues;
7they love to be greeted in the
marketplaces and to have men call them
'Rabbi.'
8"But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for
you have only one Master and you are
all brothers.
9And do not call anyone on earth 'father,'
for you have one Father, and he is in
heaven.
10Nor are you to be called 'teacher,' for
you have one Teacher, the Christ.
11The greatest among you will be your
servant.
12For whoever exalts himself will be
humbled, and whoever humbles himself
will be exalted.
13"Woe to you, teachers of the law and
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the
kingdom of heaven in men's faces. You
yourselves do not enter, nor will you let
those enter who are trying to.
15"Woe to you, teachers of the law and
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel
over land and sea to win a single
convert, and when he becomes one,
you make him twice as much a son of
hell as you are.
16"Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'If
anyone swears by the temple, it means
nothing; but if anyone swears by the
gold of the temple, he is bound by his
oath.'
17You blind fools! Which is greater: the
gold, or the temple that makes the gold
sacred?
18You also say, 'If anyone swears by the
altar, it means nothing; but if anyone
swears by the gift on it, he is bound by
his oath.'
19You blind men! Which is greater: the
gift, or the altar that makes the gift
sacred?
20Therefore, he who swears by the altar
swears by it and by everything on it.
21And he who swears by the temple
swears by it and by the one who dwells
in it.
22And he who swears by heaven swears
by God's throne and by the one who sits
on it.
23"Woe to you, teachers of the law and
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a
tenth of your spices--mint, dill and
cummin. But you have neglected the
more important matters of the law--
justice, mercy and faithfulness. You
should have practiced the latter, without
neglecting the former.
24You blind guides! You strain out a gnat
but swallow a camel.
25"Woe to you, teachers of the law and
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean
the outside of the cup and dish, but
inside they are full of greed and selfindulgence.
26Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside
of the cup and dish, and then the
outside also will be clean.
27"Woe to you, teachers of the law and
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like
whitewashed tombs, which look
beautiful on the outside but on the inside
are full of dead men's bones and
everything unclean.
28In the same way, on the outside you
appear to people as righteous but on the
inside you are full of hypocrisy and
wickedness.
29"Woe to you, teachers of the law and
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build
tombs for the prophets and decorate the
graves of the righteous.
30And you say, 'If we had lived in the
days of our forefathers, we would not
have taken part with them in shedding
the blood of the prophets.'
31So you testify against yourselves that
you are the descendants of those who
murdered the prophets.
32Fill up, then, the measure of the sin of
your forefathers!
33"You snakes! You brood of vipers!
How will you escape being condemned
to hell?
34Therefore I am sending you prophets
and wise men and teachers. Some of
them you will kill and crucify; others you
will flog in your synagogues and pursue
from town to town.
35And so upon you will come all the
righteous blood that has been shed on
earth, from the blood of righteous Abel
to the blood of Zechariah son of
Berekiah, whom you murdered between
the temple and the altar.
36I tell you the truth, all this will come
upon this generation.
37"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill
the prophets and stone those sent to
you, how often I have longed to gather
your children together, as a hen gathers
her chicks under her wings, but you
were not willing.
38Look, your house is left to you
desolate.
39For I tell you, you will not see me
again until you say, 'Blessed is he who
comes in the name of the Lord.' "
24Jesus left the temple and was
walking away when his disciples came
up to him to call his attention to its
buildings.
2"Do you see all these things?" he asked.
"I tell you the truth, not one stone here
will be left on another; every one will be
thrown down."
3As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of
Olives, the disciples came to him
privately. "Tell us," they said, "when will
this happen, and what will be the sign of
your coming and of the end of the age?"
4Jesus answered: "Watch out that no
one deceives you.
5For many will come in my name,
claiming, 'I am the Christ, ' and will
deceive many.
6You will hear of wars and rumors of
wars, but see to it that you are not
alarmed. Such things must happen, but
the end is still to come.
7Nation will rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom. There will be
famines and earthquakes in various
places.
8All these are the beginning of birth
pains.
9"Then you will be handed over to be
persecuted and put to death, and you
will be hated by all nations because of
me.
10At that time many will turn away from
the faith and will betray and hate each
other,
11and many false prophets will appear
and deceive many people.
12Because of the increase of
wickedness, the love of most will grow
cold,
13but he who stands firm to the end will
be saved.
14And this gospel of the kingdom will be
preached in the whole world as a
testimony to all nations, and then the
end will come.
15"So when you see standing in the holy
place 'the abomination that causes
desolation,' spoken of through the
prophet Daniel--let the reader
understand--
16then let those who are in Judea flee to
the mountains.
17Let no one on the roof of his house go
down to take anything out of the house.
18Let no one in the field go back to get
his cloak.
19How dreadful it will be in those days
for pregnant women and nursing
mothers!
20Pray that your flight will not take place
in winter or on the Sabbath.
21For then there will be great distress,
unequaled from the beginning of the
world until now--and never to be
equaled again.
22If those days had not been cut short,
no one would survive, but for the sake of
the elect those days will be shortened.
23At that time if anyone says to you,
'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There he
is!' do not believe it.
24For false Christs and false prophets
will appear and perform great signs and
miracles to deceive even the elect--if
that were possible.
25See, I have told you ahead of time.
26"So if anyone tells you, 'There he is,
out in the desert,' do not go out; or,
'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not
believe it.
27For as lightning that comes from the
east is visible even in the west, so will
be the coming of the Son of Man.
28Wherever there is a carcass, there the
vultures will gather.
29"Immediately after the distress of those
days " 'the sun will be darkened, and the
moon will not give its light; the stars will
fall from the sky, and the heavenly
bodies will be shaken.'
30"At that time the sign of the Son of
Man will appear in the sky, and all the
nations of the earth will mourn. They will
see the Son of Man coming on the
clouds of the sky, with power and great
glory.
31And he will send his angels with a loud
trumpet call, and they will gather his
elect from the four winds, from one end
of the heavens to the other.
32"Now learn this lesson from the fig
tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and
its leaves come out, you know that
summer is near.
33Even so, when you see all these
things, you know that it is near, right at
the door.
34I tell you the truth, this generation will
certainly not pass away until all these
things have happened.
35Heaven and earth will pass away, but
my words will never pass away.
36"No one knows about that day or hour,
not even the angels in heaven, nor the
Son, but only the Father.
37As it was in the days of Noah, so it will
be at the coming of the Son of Man.
38For in the days before the flood,
people were eating and drinking,
marrying and giving in marriage, up to
the day Noah entered the ark;
39and they knew nothing about what
would happen until the flood came and
took them all away. That is how it will be
at the coming of the Son of Man.
40Two men will be in the field; one will
be taken and the other left.
41Two women will be grinding with a
hand mill; one will be taken and the
other left.
42"Therefore keep watch, because you
do not know on what day your Lord will
come.
43But understand this: If the owner of the
house had known at what time of night
the thief was coming, he would have
kept watch and would not have let his
house be broken into.
44So you also must be ready, because
the Son of Man will come at an hour
when you do not expect him.
45"Who then is the faithful and wise
servant, whom the master has put in
charge of the servants in his household
to give them their food at the proper
time?
46It will be good for that servant whose
master finds him doing so when he
returns.
47I tell you the truth, he will put him in
charge of all his possessions.
48But suppose that servant is wicked
and says to himself, 'My master is
staying away a long time,'
49and he then begins to beat his fellow
servants and to eat and drink with
drunkards.
50The master of that servant will come
on a day when he does not expect him
and at an hour he is not aware of.
51He will cut him to pieces and assign
him a place with the hypocrites, where
there will be weeping and gnashing of
teeth.
25"At that time the kingdom of
heaven will be like ten virgins who took
their lamps and went out to meet the
bridegroom.
2Five of them were foolish and five were
wise.
3The foolish ones took their lamps but
did not take any oil with them.
4The wise, however, took oil in jars
along with their lamps.
5The bridegroom was a long time in
coming, and they all became drowsy
and fell asleep.
6"At midnight the cry rang out: 'Here's
the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!'
7"Then all the virgins woke up and
trimmed their lamps.
8The foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give
us some of your oil; our lamps are going
out.'
9" 'No,' they replied, 'there may not be
enough for both us and you. Instead, go
to those who sell oil and buy some for
yourselves.'
10"But while they were on their way to
buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The
virgins who were ready went in with him
to the wedding banquet. And the door
was shut.
11"Later the others also came. 'Sir! Sir!'
they said. 'Open the door for us!'
12"But he replied, 'I tell you the truth, I
don't know you.'
13"Therefore keep watch, because you
do not know the day or the hour.
14"Again, it will be like a man going on a
journey, who called his servants and
entrusted his property to them.
15To one he gave five talents of money,
to another two talents, and to another
one talent, each according to his ability.
Then he went on his journey.
16The man who had received the five
talents went at once and put his money
to work and gained five more.
17So also, the one with the two talents
gained two more.
18But the man who had received the one
talent went off, dug a hole in the ground
and hid his master's money.
19"After a long time the master of those
servants returned and settled accounts
with them.
20The man who had received the five
talents brought the other five. 'Master,'
he said, 'you entrusted me with five
talents. See, I have gained five more.'
21"His master replied, 'Well done, good
and faithful servant! You have been
faithful with a few things; I will put you in
charge of many things. Come and share
your master's happiness!'
22"The man with the two talents also
came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted
me with two talents; see, I have gained
two more.'
23"His master replied, 'Well done, good
and faithful servant! You have been
faithful with a few things; I will put you in
charge of many things. Come and share
your master's happiness!'
24"Then the man who had received the
one talent came. 'Master,' he said, 'I
knew that you are a hard man,
harvesting where you have not sown
and gathering where you have not
scattered seed.
25So I was afraid and went out and hid
your talent in the ground. See, here is
what belongs to you.'
26"His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy
servant! So you knew that I harvest
where I have not sown and gather
where I have not scattered seed?
27Well then, you should have put my
money on deposit with the bankers, so
that when I returned I would have
received it back with interest.
28" 'Take the talent from him and give it
to the one who has the ten talents.
29For everyone who has will be given
more, and he will have an abundance.
Whoever does not have, even what he
has will be taken from him.
30And throw that worthless servant
outside, into the darkness, where there
will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
31"When the Son of Man comes in his
glory, and all the angels with him, he will
sit on his throne in heavenly glory.
32All the nations will be gathered before
him, and he will separate the people one
from another as a shepherd separates
the sheep from the goats.
33He will put the sheep on his right and
the goats on his left.
34"Then the King will say to those on his
right, 'Come, you who are blessed by
my Father; take your inheritance, the
kingdom prepared for you since the
creation of the world.
35For I was hungry and you gave me
something to eat, I was thirsty and you
gave me something to drink, I was a
stranger and you invited me in,
36I needed clothes and you clothed me, I
was sick and you looked after me, I was
in prison and you came to visit me.'
37"Then the righteous will answer him,
'Lord, when did we see you hungry and
feed you, or thirsty and give you
something to drink?
38When did we see you a stranger and
invite you in, or needing clothes and
clothe you?
39When did we see you sick or in prison
and go to visit you?'
40"The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth,
whatever you did for one of the least of
these brothers of mine, you did for me.'
41"Then he will say to those on his left,
'Depart from me, you who are cursed,
into the eternal fire prepared for the
devil and his angels.
42For I was hungry and you gave me
nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you
gave me nothing to drink,
43I was a stranger and you did not invite
me in, I needed clothes and you did not
clothe me, I was sick and in prison and
you did not look after me.'
44"They also will answer, 'Lord, when did
we see you hungry or thirsty or a
stranger or needing clothes or sick or in
prison, and did not help you?'
45"He will reply, 'I tell you the truth,
whatever you did not do for one of the
least of these, you did not do for me.'
46"Then they will go away to eternal
punishment, but the righteous to eternal
life."
26When Jesus had finished saying
all these things, he said to his disciples,
2"As you know, the Passover is two
days away--and the Son of Man will be
handed over to be crucified."
3Then the chief priests and the elders of
the people assembled in the palace of
the high priest, whose name was
Caiaphas,
4and they plotted to arrest Jesus in
some sly way and kill him.
5"But not during the Feast," they said,
"or there may be a riot among the
people."
6While Jesus was in Bethany in the
home of a man known as Simon the
Leper,
7a woman came to him with an alabaster
jar of very expensive perfume, which
she poured on his head as he was
reclining at the table.
8When the disciples saw this, they were
indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked.
9"This perfume could have been sold at
a high price and the money given to the
poor."
10Aware of this, Jesus said to them,
"Why are you bothering this woman?
She has done a beautiful thing to me.
11The poor you will always have with
you, but you will not always have me.
12When she poured this perfume on my
body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
13I tell you the truth, wherever this
gospel is preached throughout the world,
what she has done will also be told, in
memory of her."
14Then one of the Twelve--the one
called Judas Iscariot--went to the chief
priests
15and asked, "What are you willing to
give me if I hand him over to you?" So
they counted out for him thirty silver
coins.
16From then on Judas watched for an
opportunity to hand him over.
17On the first day of the Feast of
Unleavened Bread, the disciples came
to Jesus and asked, "Where do you
want us to make preparations for you to
eat the Passover?"
18He replied, "Go into the city to a
certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher
says: My appointed time is near. I am
going to celebrate the Passover with my
disciples at your house.' "
19So the disciples did as Jesus had
directed them and prepared the
Passover.
20When evening came, Jesus was
reclining at the table with the Twelve.
21And while they were eating, he said, "I
tell you the truth, one of you will betray
me."
22They were very sad and began to say
to him one after the other, "Surely not I,
Lord?"
23Jesus replied, "The one who has
dipped his hand into the bowl with me
will betray me.
24The Son of Man will go just as it is
written about him. But woe to that man
who betrays the Son of Man! It would be
better for him if he had not been born."
25Then Judas, the one who would betray
him, said, "Surely not I, Rabbi?" Jesus
answered, "Yes, it is you."
26While they were eating, Jesus took
bread, gave thanks and broke it, and
gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take
and eat; this is my body."
27Then he took the cup, gave thanks
and offered it to them, saying, "Drink
from it, all of you.
28This is my blood of the covenant,
which is poured out for many for the
forgiveness of sins.
29I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of
the vine from now on until that day when
I drink it anew with you in my Father's
kingdom."
30When they had sung a hymn, they
went out to the Mount of Olives.
31Then Jesus told them, "This very night
you will all fall away on account of me,
for it is written: " 'I will strike the
shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will
be scattered.'
32But after I have risen, I will go ahead
of you into Galilee."
33Peter replied, "Even if all fall away on
account of you, I never will."
34"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered,
"this very night, before the rooster crows,
you will disown me three times."
35But Peter declared, "Even if I have to
die with you, I will never disown you."
And all the other disciples said the same.
36Then Jesus went with his disciples to a
place called Gethsemane, and he said
to them, "Sit here while I go over there
and pray."
37He took Peter and the two sons of
Zebedee along with him, and he began
to be sorrowful and troubled.
38Then he said to them, "My soul is
overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of
death. Stay here and keep watch with
me."
39Going a little farther, he fell with his
face to the ground and prayed, "My
Father, if it is possible, may this cup be
taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as
you will."
40Then he returned to his disciples and
found them sleeping. "Could you men
not keep watch with me for one hour?"
he asked Peter.
41"Watch and pray so that you will not
fall into temptation. The spirit is willing,
but the body is weak."
42He went away a second time and
prayed, "My Father, if it is not possible
for this cup to be taken away unless I
drink it, may your will be done."
43When he came back, he again found
them sleeping, because their eyes were
heavy.
44So he left them and went away once
more and prayed the third time, saying
the same thing.
45Then he returned to the disciples and
said to them, "Are you still sleeping and
resting? Look, the hour is near, and the
Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of
sinners.
46Rise, let us go! Here comes my
betrayer!"
47While he was still speaking, Judas,
one of the Twelve, arrived. With him
was a large crowd armed with swords
and clubs, sent from the chief priests
and the elders of the people.
48Now the betrayer had arranged a
signal with them: "The one I kiss is the
man; arrest him."
49Going at once to Jesus, Judas said,
"Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
50Jesus replied, "Friend, do what you
came for."
51Then the men stepped forward, seized
Jesus and arrested him. With that, one
of Jesus' companions reached for his
sword, drew it out and struck the servant
of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
52"Put your sword back in its place,"
Jesus said to him, "for all who draw the
sword will die by the sword.
53Do you think I cannot call on my
Father, and he will at once put at my
disposal more than twelve legions of
angels?
54But how then would the Scriptures be
fulfilled that say it must happen in this
way?"
55At that time Jesus said to the crowd,
"Am I leading a rebellion, that you have
come out with swords and clubs to
capture me? Every day I sat in the
temple courts teaching, and you did not
arrest me.
56But this has all taken place that the
writings of the prophets might be
fulfilled." Then all the disciples deserted
him and fled.
57Those who had arrested Jesus took
him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where
the teachers of the law and the elders
had assembled.
58But Peter followed him at a distance,
right up to the courtyard of the high
priest. He entered and sat down with the
guards to see the outcome.
59The chief priests and the whole
Sanhedrin were looking for false
evidence against Jesus so that they
could put him to death.
60But they did not find any, though many
false witnesses came forward.
61Finally two came forward and declared,
"This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy
the temple of God and rebuild it in three
days.' "
62Then the high priest stood up and said
to Jesus, "Are you not going to answer?
What is this testimony that these men
are bringing against you?"
63But Jesus remained silent. The high
priest said to him, "I charge you under
oath by the living God: Tell us if you are
the Christ, the Son of God."
64"Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.
"But I say to all of you: In the future you
will see the Son of Man sitting at the
right hand of the Mighty One and
coming on the clouds of heaven."
65Then the high priest tore his clothes
and said, "He has spoken blasphemy!
Why do we need any more witnesses?
Look, now you have heard the
blasphemy.
66What do you think?" "He is worthy of
death," they answered.
67Then they spit in his face and struck
him with their fists. Others slapped him
68and said, "Prophesy to us, Christ. Who
hit you?"
69Now Peter was sitting out in the
courtyard, and a servant girl came to
him. "You also were with Jesus of
Galilee," she said.
70But he denied it before them all. "I
don't know what you're talking about,"
he said.
71Then he went out to the gateway,
where another girl saw him and said to
the people there, "This fellow was with
Jesus of Nazareth."
72He denied it again, with an oath: "I
don't know the man!"
73After a little while, those standing there
went up to Peter and said, "Surely you
are one of them, for your accent gives
you away."
74Then he began to call down curses on
himself and he swore to them, "I don't
know the man!"
75Immediately a rooster crowed. Then
Peter remembered the word Jesus had
spoken: "Before the rooster crows, you
will disown me three times." And he
went outside and wept bitterly.
27Early in the morning, all the chief
priests and the elders of the people
came to the decision to put Jesus to
death.
2They bound him, led him away and
handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
3When Judas, who had betrayed him,
saw that Jesus was condemned, he was
seized with remorse and returned the
thirty silver coins to the chief priests and
the elders.
4"I have sinned," he said, "for I have
betrayed innocent blood." "What is that
to us?" they replied. "That's your
responsibility."
5So Judas threw the money into the
temple and left. Then he went away and
hanged himself.
6The chief priests picked up the coins
and said, "It is against the law to put this
into the treasury, since it is blood
money."
7So they decided to use the money to
buy the potter's field as a burial place for
foreigners.
8That is why it has been called the Field
of Blood to this day.
9Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the
prophet was fulfilled: "They took the
thirty silver coins, the price set on him
by the people of Israel,
10and they used them to buy the potter's
field, as the Lord commanded me."
11Meanwhile Jesus stood before the
governor, and the governor asked him,
"Are you the king of the Jews?" "Yes, it
is as you say," Jesus replied.
12When he was accused by the chief
priests and the elders, he gave no
answer.
13Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you
hear the testimony they are bringing
against you?"
14But Jesus made no reply, not even to
a single charge--to the great
amazement of the governor.
15Now it was the governor's custom at
the Feast to release a prisoner chosen
by the crowd.
16At that time they had a notorious
prisoner, called Barabbas.
17So when the crowd had gathered,
Pilate asked them, "Which one do you
want me to release to you: Barabbas, or
Jesus who is called Christ?"
18For he knew it was out of envy that
they had handed Jesus over to him.
19While Pilate was sitting on the judge's
seat, his wife sent him this message:
"Don't have anything to do with that
innocent man, for I have suffered a
great deal today in a dream because of
him."
20But the chief priests and the elders
persuaded the crowd to ask for
Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.
21"Which of the two do you want me to
release to you?" asked the governor.
"Barabbas," they answered.
22"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who
is called Christ?" Pilate asked. They all
answered, "Crucify him!"
23"Why? What crime has he
committed?" asked Pilate. But they
shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
24When Pilate saw that he was getting
nowhere, but that instead an uproar was
starting, he took water and washed his
hands in front of the crowd. "I am
innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It
is your responsibility!"
25All the people answered, "Let his blood
be on us and on our children!"
26Then he released Barabbas to them.
But he had Jesus flogged, and handed
him over to be crucified.
27Then the governor's soldiers took
Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered
the whole company of soldiers around
him.
28They stripped him and put a scarlet
robe on him,
29and then twisted together a crown of
thorns and set it on his head. They put a
staff in his right hand and knelt in front
of him and mocked him. "Hail, king of
the Jews!" they said.
30They spit on him, and took the staff
and struck him on the head again and
again.
31After they had mocked him, they took
off the robe and put his own clothes on
him. Then they led him away to crucify
him.
32As they were going out, they met a
man from Cyrene, named Simon, and
they forced him to carry the cross.
33They came to a place called Golgotha
(which means The Place of the Skull).
34There they offered Jesus wine to drink,
mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he
refused to drink it.
35When they had crucified him, they
divided up his clothes by casting lots.
36And sitting down, they kept watch over
him there.
37Above his head they placed the written
charge against him:
38Two robbers were crucified with him,
one on his right and one on his left.
39Those who passed by hurled insults at
him, shaking their heads
40and saying, "You who are going to
destroy the temple and build it in three
days, save yourself! Come down from
the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
41In the same way the chief priests, the
teachers of the law and the elders
mocked him.
42"He saved others," they said, "but he
can't save himself! He's the King of
Israel! Let him come down now from the
cross, and we will believe in him.
43He trusts in God. Let God rescue him
now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am
the Son of God.' "
44In the same way the robbers who were
crucified with him also heaped insults on
him.
45From the sixth hour until the ninth hour
darkness came over all the land.
46About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in
a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama
sabachthani?"--which means, "My God,
my God, why have you forsaken me?"
47When some of those standing there
heard this, they said, "He's calling
Elijah."
48Immediately one of them ran and got a
sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar,
put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus
to drink.
49The rest said, "Now leave him alone.
Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."
50And when Jesus had cried out again in
a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.
51At that moment the curtain of the
temple was torn in two from top to
bottom. The earth shook and the rocks
split.
52The tombs broke open and the bodies
of many holy people who had died were
raised to life.
53They came out of the tombs, and after
Jesus' resurrection they went into the
holy city and appeared to many people.
54When the centurion and those with
him who were guarding Jesus saw the
earthquake and all that had happened,
they were terrified, and exclaimed,
"Surely he was the Son of God!"
55Many women were there, watching
from a distance. They had followed
Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
56Among them were Mary Magdalene,
Mary the mother of James and Joses,
and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
57As evening approached, there came a
rich man from Arimathea, named
Joseph, who had himself become a
disciple of Jesus.
58Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus'
body, and Pilate ordered that it be given
to him.
59Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a
clean linen cloth,
60and placed it in his own new tomb that
he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a
big stone in front of the entrance to the
tomb and went away.
61Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
were sitting there opposite the tomb.
62The next day, the one after
Preparation Day, the chief priests and
the Pharisees went to Pilate.
63"Sir," they said, "we remember that
while he was still alive that deceiver said,
'After three days I will rise again.'
64So give the order for the tomb to be
made secure until the third day.
Otherwise, his disciples may come and
steal the body and tell the people that
he has been raised from the dead. This
last deception will be worse than the
first."
65"Take a guard," Pilate answered. "Go,
make the tomb as secure as you know
how."
66So they went and made the tomb
secure by putting a seal on the stone
and posting the guard.
28After the Sabbath, at dawn on the
first day of the week, Mary Magdalene
and the other Mary went to look at the
tomb.
2There was a violent earthquake, for an
angel of the Lord came down from
heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled
back the stone and sat on it.
3His appearance was like lightning, and
his clothes were white as snow.
4The guards were so afraid of him that
they shook and became like dead men.
5The angel said to the women, "Do not
be afraid, for I know that you are looking
for Jesus, who was crucified.
6He is not here; he has risen, just as he
said. Come and see the place where he
lay.
7Then go quickly and tell his disciples:
'He has risen from the dead and is going
ahead of you into Galilee. There you will
see him.' Now I have told you."
8So the women hurried away from the
tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to
tell his disciples.
9Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings,"
he said. They came to him, clasped his
feet and worshiped him.
10Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be
afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to
Galilee; there they will see me."
11While the women were on their way,
some of the guards went into the city
and reported to the chief priests
everything that had happened.
12When the chief priests had met with
the elders and devised a plan, they gave
the soldiers a large sum of money,
13telling them, "You are to say, 'His
disciples came during the night and
stole him away while we were asleep.'
14If this report gets to the governor, we
will satisfy him and keep you out of
trouble."
15So the soldiers took the money and
did as they were instructed. And this
story has been widely circulated among
the Jews to this very day.
16Then the eleven disciples went to
Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus
had told them to go.
17When they saw him, they worshiped
him; but some doubted.
18Then Jesus came to them and said,
"All authority in heaven and on earth has
been given to me.
19Therefore go and make disciples of all
nations, baptizing them in the name of
the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit,
20and teaching them to obey everything I
have commanded you. And surely I am
with you always, to the very end of the
age."
Mark
1The beginning of the gospel about
Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
2It is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will
send my messenger ahead of you, who
will prepare your way" --
3"a voice of one calling in the desert,
'Prepare the way for the Lord, make
straight paths for him.' "
4And so John came, baptizing in the
desert region and preaching a baptism
of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
5The whole Judean countryside and all
the people of Jerusalem went out to him.
Confessing their sins, they were
baptized by him in the Jordan River.
6John wore clothing made of camel's
hair, with a leather belt around his waist,
and he ate locusts and wild honey.
7And this was his message: "After me
will come one more powerful than I, the
thongs of whose sandals I am not
worthy to stoop down and untie.
8I baptize you with water, but he will
baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
9At that time Jesus came from Nazareth
in Galilee and was baptized by John in
the Jordan.
10As Jesus was coming up out of the
water, he saw heaven being torn open
and the Spirit descending on him like a
dove.
11And a voice came from heaven: "You
are my Son, whom I love; with you I am
well pleased."
12At once the Spirit sent him out into the
desert,
13and he was in the desert forty days,
being tempted by Satan. He was with
the wild animals, and angels attended
him.
14After John was put in prison, Jesus
went into Galilee, proclaiming the good
news of God.
15"The time has come," he said. "The
kingdom of God is near. Repent and
believe the good news!"
16As Jesus walked beside the Sea of
Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother
Andrew casting a net into the lake, for
they were fishermen.
17"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I
will make you fishers of men."
18At once they left their nets and
followed him.
19When he had gone a little farther, he
saw James son of Zebedee and his
brother John in a boat, preparing their
nets.
20Without delay he called them, and they
left their father Zebedee in the boat with
the hired men and followed him.
21They went to Capernaum, and when
the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the
synagogue and began to teach.
22The people were amazed at his
teaching, because he taught them as
one who had authority, not as the
teachers of the law.
23Just then a man in their synagogue
who was possessed by an evil spirit
cried out,
24"What do you want with us, Jesus of
Nazareth? Have you come to destroy
us? I know who you are--the Holy One
of God!"
25"Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come
out of him!"
26The evil spirit shook the man violently
and came out of him with a shriek.
27The people were all so amazed that
they asked each other, "What is this? A
new teaching--and with authority! He
even gives orders to evil spirits and they
obey him."
28News about him spread quickly over
the whole region of Galilee.
29As soon as they left the synagogue,
they went with James and John to the
home of Simon and Andrew.
30Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with
a fever, and they told Jesus about her.
31So he went to her, took her hand and
helped her up. The fever left her and
she began to wait on them.
32That evening after sunset the people
brought to Jesus all the sick and demonpossessed.
33The whole town gathered at the door,
34and Jesus healed many who had
various diseases. He also drove out
many demons, but he would not let the
demons speak because they knew who
he was.
35Very early in the morning, while it was
still dark, Jesus got up, left the house
and went off to a solitary place, where
he prayed.
36Simon and his companions went to
look for him,
37and when they found him, they
exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for
you!"
38Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere
else--to the nearby villages--so I can
preach there also. That is why I have
come."
39So he traveled throughout Galilee,
preaching in their synagogues and
driving out demons.
40A man with leprosy came to him and
begged him on his knees, "If you are
willing, you can make me clean."
41Filled with compassion, Jesus reached
out his hand and touched the man. "I am
willing," he said. "Be clean!"
42Immediately the leprosy left him and
he was cured.
43Jesus sent him away at once with a
strong warning:
44"See that you don't tell this to anyone.
But go, show yourself to the priest and
offer the sacrifices that Moses
commanded for your cleansing, as a
testimony to them."
45Instead he went out and began to talk
freely, spreading the news. As a result,
Jesus could no longer enter a town
openly but stayed outside in lonely
places. Yet the people still came to him
from everywhere.
2A few days later, when Jesus again
entered Capernaum, the people heard
that he had come home.
2So many gathered that there was no
room left, not even outside the door, and
he preached the word to them.
3Some men came, bringing to him a
paralytic, carried by four of them.
4Since they could not get him to Jesus
because of the crowd, they made an
opening in the roof above Jesus and,
after digging through it, lowered the mat
the paralyzed man was lying on.
5When Jesus saw their faith, he said to
the paralytic, "Son, your sins are
forgiven."
6Now some teachers of the law were
sitting there, thinking to themselves,
7"Why does this fellow talk like that?
He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins
but God alone?"
8Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit
that this was what they were thinking in
their hearts, and he said to them, "Why
are you thinking these things?
9Which is easier: to say to the paralytic,
'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get
up, take your mat and walk'?
10But that you may know that the Son of
Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins . . . ." He said to the paralytic,
11"I tell you, get up, take your mat and
go home."
12He got up, took his mat and walked
out in full view of them all. This amazed
everyone and they praised God, saying,
"We have never seen anything like this!"
13Once again Jesus went out beside the
lake. A large crowd came to him, and he
began to teach them.
14As he walked along, he saw Levi son
of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's
booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and
Levi got up and followed him.
15While Jesus was having dinner at
Levi's house, many tax collectors and
"sinners" were eating with him and his
disciples, for there were many who
followed him.
16When the teachers of the law who
were Pharisees saw him eating with the
"sinners" and tax collectors, they asked
his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax
collectors and 'sinners'?"
17On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It
is not the healthy who need a doctor,
but the sick. I have not come to call the
righteous, but sinners."
18Now John's disciples and the
Pharisees were fasting. Some people
came and asked Jesus, "How is it that
John's disciples and the disciples of the
Pharisees are fasting, but yours are
not?"
19Jesus answered, "How can the guests
of the bridegroom fast while he is with
them? They cannot, so long as they
have him with them.
20But the time will come when the
bridegroom will be taken from them, and
on that day they will fast.
21"No one sews a patch of unshrunk
cloth on an old garment. If he does, the
new piece will pull away from the old,
making the tear worse.
22And no one pours new wine into old
wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst
the skins, and both the wine and the
wineskins will be ruined. No, he pours
new wine into new wineskins."
23One Sabbath Jesus was going through
the grainfields, and as his disciples
walked along, they began to pick some
heads of grain.
24The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why
are they doing what is unlawful on the
Sabbath?"
25He answered, "Have you never read
what David did when he and his
companions were hungry and in need?
26In the days of Abiathar the high priest,
he entered the house of God and ate
the consecrated bread, which is lawful
only for priests to eat. And he also gave
some to his companions."
27Then he said to them, "The Sabbath
was made for man, not man for the
Sabbath.
28So the Son of Man is Lord even of the
Sabbath."
3Another time he went into the
synagogue, and a man with a shriveled
hand was there.
2Some of them were looking for a
reason to accuse Jesus, so they
watched him closely to see if he would
heal him on the Sabbath.
3Jesus said to the man with the
shriveled hand, "Stand up in front of
everyone."
4Then Jesus asked them, "Which is
lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to
do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they
remained silent.
5He looked around at them in anger and,
deeply distressed at their stubborn
hearts, said to the man, "Stretch out
your hand." He stretched it out, and his
hand was completely restored.
6Then the Pharisees went out and
began to plot with the Herodians how
they might kill Jesus.
7Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the
lake, and a large crowd from Galilee
followed.
8When they heard all he was doing,
many people came to him from Judea,
Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions
across the Jordan and around Tyre and
Sidon.
9Because of the crowd he told his
disciples to have a small boat ready for
him, to keep the people from crowding
him.
10For he had healed many, so that those
with diseases were pushing forward to
touch him.
11Whenever the evil spirits saw him,
they fell down before him and cried out,
"You are the Son of God."
12But he gave them strict orders not to
tell who he was.
13Jesus went up on a mountainside and
called to him those he wanted, and they
came to him.
14He appointed twelve--designating
them apostles --that they might be with
him and that he might send them out to
preach
15and to have authority to drive out
demons.
16These are the twelve he appointed:
Simon (to whom he gave the name
Peter);
17James son of Zebedee and his brother
John (to them he gave the name
Boanerges, which means Sons of
Thunder);
18Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew,
Thomas, James son of Alphaeus,
Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot
19and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
20Then Jesus entered a house, and
again a crowd gathered, so that he and
his disciples were not even able to eat.
21When his family heard about this, they
went to take charge of him, for they said,
"He is out of his mind."
22And the teachers of the law who came
down from Jerusalem said, "He is
possessed by Beelzebub ! By the prince
of demons he is driving out demons."
23So Jesus called them and spoke to
them in parables: "How can Satan drive
out Satan?
24If a kingdom is divided against itself,
that kingdom cannot stand.
25If a house is divided against itself, that
house cannot stand.
26And if Satan opposes himself and is
divided, he cannot stand; his end has
come.
27In fact, no one can enter a strong
man's house and carry off his
possessions unless he first ties up the
strong man. Then he can rob his house.
28I tell you the truth, all the sins and
blasphemies of men will be forgiven
them.
29But whoever blasphemes against the
Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is
guilty of an eternal sin."
30He said this because they were saying,
"He has an evil spirit."
31Then Jesus' mother and brothers
arrived. Standing outside, they sent
someone in to call him.
32A crowd was sitting around him, and
they told him, "Your mother and brothers
are outside looking for you."
33"Who are my mother and my
brothers?" he asked.
34Then he looked at those seated in a
circle around him and said, "Here are
my mother and my brothers!
35Whoever does God's will is my brother
and sister and mother."
4Again Jesus began to teach by the
lake. The crowd that gathered around
him was so large that he got into a boat
and sat in it out on the lake, while all the
people were along the shore at the
water's edge.
2He taught them many things by
parables, and in his teaching said:
3"Listen! A farmer went out to sow his
seed.
4As he was scattering the seed, some
fell along the path, and the birds came
and ate it up.
5Some fell on rocky places, where it did
not have much soil. It sprang up quickly,
because the soil was shallow.
6But when the sun came up, the plants
were scorched, and they withered
because they had no root.
7Other seed fell among thorns, which
grew up and choked the plants, so that
they did not bear grain.
8Still other seed fell on good soil. It
came up, grew and produced a crop,
multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a
hundred times."
9Then Jesus said, "He who has ears to
hear, let him hear."
10When he was alone, the Twelve and
the others around him asked him about
the parables.
11He told them, "The secret of the
kingdom of God has been given to you.
But to those on the outside everything is
said in parables
12so that, " 'they may be ever seeing but
never perceiving, and ever hearing but
never understanding; otherwise they
might turn and be forgiven!' "
13Then Jesus said to them, "Don't you
understand this parable? How then will
you understand any parable?
14The farmer sows the word.
15Some people are like seed along the
path, where the word is sown. As soon
as they hear it, Satan comes and takes
away the word that was sown in them.
16Others, like seed sown on rocky
places, hear the word and at once
receive it with joy.
17But since they have no root, they last
only a short time. When trouble or
persecution comes because of the word,
they quickly fall away.
18Still others, like seed sown among
thorns, hear the word;
19but the worries of this life, the
deceitfulness of wealth and the desires
for other things come in and choke the
word, making it unfruitful.
20Others, like seed sown on good soil,
hear the word, accept it, and produce a
crop--thirty, sixty or even a hundred
times what was sown."
21He said to them, "Do you bring in a
lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed?
Instead, don't you put it on its stand?
22For whatever is hidden is meant to be
disclosed, and whatever is concealed is
meant to be brought out into the open.
23If anyone has ears to hear, let him
hear."
24"Consider carefully what you hear," he
continued. "With the measure you use, it
will be measured to you--and even more.
25Whoever has will be given more;
whoever does not have, even what he
has will be taken from him."
26He also said, "This is what the
kingdom of God is like. A man scatters
seed on the ground.
27Night and day, whether he sleeps or
gets up, the seed sprouts and grows,
though he does not know how.
28All by itself the soil produces grain--
first the stalk, then the head, then the
full kernel in the head.
29As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts
the sickle to it, because the harvest has
come."
30Again he said, "What shall we say the
kingdom of God is like, or what parable
shall we use to describe it?
31It is like a mustard seed, which is the
smallest seed you plant in the ground.
32Yet when planted, it grows and
becomes the largest of all garden plants,
with such big branches that the birds of
the air can perch in its shade."
33With many similar parables Jesus
spoke the word to them, as much as
they could understand.
34He did not say anything to them
without using a parable. But when he
was alone with his own disciples, he
explained everything.
35That day when evening came, he said
to his disciples, "Let us go over to the
other side."
36Leaving the crowd behind, they took
him along, just as he was, in the boat.
There were also other boats with him.
37A furious squall came up, and the
waves broke over the boat, so that it
was nearly swamped.
38Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a
cushion. The disciples woke him and
said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if
we drown?"
39He got up, rebuked the wind and said
to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Then the
wind died down and it was completely
calm.
40He said to his disciples, "Why are you
so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"
41They were terrified and asked each
other, "Who is this? Even the wind and
the waves obey him!"
5They went across the lake to the
region of the Gerasenes.
2When Jesus got out of the boat, a man
with an evil spirit came from the tombs
to meet him.
3This man lived in the tombs, and no
one could bind him any more, not even
with a chain.
4For he had often been chained hand
and foot, but he tore the chains apart
and broke the irons on his feet. No one
was strong enough to subdue him.
5Night and day among the tombs and in
the hills he would cry out and cut himself
with stones.
6When he saw Jesus from a distance,
he ran and fell on his knees in front of
him.
7He shouted at the top of his voice,
"What do you want with me, Jesus, Son
of the Most High God? Swear to God
that you won't torture me!"
8For Jesus had said to him, "Come out
of this man, you evil spirit!"
9Then Jesus asked him, "What is your
name?"
10"My name is Legion," he replied, "for
we are many." And he begged Jesus
again and again not to send them out of
the area.
11A large herd of pigs was feeding on
the nearby hillside.
12The demons begged Jesus, "Send us
among the pigs; allow us to go into
them."
13He gave them permission, and the evil
spirits came out and went into the pigs.
The herd, about two thousand in
number, rushed down the steep bank
into the lake and were drowned.
14Those tending the pigs ran off and
reported this in the town and
countryside, and the people went out to
see what had happened.
15When they came to Jesus, they saw
the man who had been possessed by
the legion of demons, sitting there,
dressed and in his right mind; and they
were afraid.
16Those who had seen it told the people
what had happened to the demonpossessed
man--and told about the pigs
as well.
17Then the people began to plead with
Jesus to leave their region.
18As Jesus was getting into the boat, the
man who had been demon-possessed
begged to go with him.
19Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go
home to your family and tell them how
much the Lord has done for you, and
how he has had mercy on you."
20So the man went away and began to
tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus
had done for him. And all the people
were amazed.
21When Jesus had again crossed over
by boat to the other side of the lake, a
large crowd gathered around him while
he was by the lake.
22Then one of the synagogue rulers,
named Jairus, came there. Seeing
Jesus, he fell at his feet
23and pleaded earnestly with him, "My
little daughter is dying. Please come and
put your hands on her so that she will be
healed and live."
24So Jesus went with him.
25A large crowd followed and pressed
around him. And a woman was there
who had been subject to bleeding for
twelve years.
26She had suffered a great deal under
the care of many doctors and had spent
all she had, yet instead of getting better
she grew worse.
27When she heard about Jesus, she
came up behind him in the crowd and
touched his cloak,
28because she thought, "If I just touch
his clothes, I will be healed."
29Immediately her bleeding stopped and
she felt in her body that she was freed
from her suffering.
30At once Jesus realized that power had
gone out from him. He turned around in
the crowd and asked, "Who touched my
clothes?"
31"You see the people crowding against
you," his disciples answered, "and yet
you can ask, 'Who touched me?' "
32But Jesus kept looking around to see
who had done it.
33Then the woman, knowing what had
happened to her, came and fell at his
feet and, trembling with fear, told him
the whole truth.
34He said to her, "Daughter, your faith
has healed you. Go in peace and be
freed from your suffering."
35While Jesus was still speaking, some
men came from the house of Jairus, the
synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is
dead," they said. "Why bother the
teacher any more?"
36Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the
synagogue ruler, "Don't be afraid; just
believe."
37He did not let anyone follow him
except Peter, James and John the
brother of James.
38When they came to the home of the
synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a
commotion, with people crying and
wailing loudly.
39He went in and said to them, "Why all
this commotion and wailing? The child is
not dead but asleep."
40But they laughed at him.
41After he put them all out, he took the
child's father and mother and the
disciples who were with him, and went
in where the child was. He took her by
the hand and said to her, "Talitha
koum!" (which means, "Little girl, I say to
you, get up!" ).
42Immediately the girl stood up and
walked around (she was twelve years
old). At this they were completely
astonished.
43He gave strict orders not to let anyone
know about this, and told them to give
her something to eat.
6Jesus left there and went to his
hometown, accompanied by his
disciples.
2When the Sabbath came, he began to
teach in the synagogue, and many who
heard him were amazed.
3"Where did this man get these things?"
they asked. "What's this wisdom that
has been given him, that he even does
miracles! Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't
this Mary's son and the brother of
James, Joseph, Judas and Simon?
Aren't his sisters here with us?" And
they took offense at him.
4Jesus said to them, "Only in his
hometown, among his relatives and in
his own house is a prophet without
honor."
5He could not do any miracles there,
except lay his hands on a few sick
people and heal them.
6And he was amazed at their lack of
faith.
7Then Jesus went around teaching from
village to village. Calling the Twelve to
him, he sent them out two by two and
gave them authority over evil spirits.
8These were his instructions: "Take
nothing for the journey except a staff--no
bread, no bag, no money in your belts.
9Wear sandals but not an extra tunic.
10Whenever you enter a house, stay
there until you leave that town.
11And if any place will not welcome you
or listen to you, shake the dust off your
feet when you leave, as a testimony
against them."
12They went out and preached that
people should repent.
13They drove out many demons and
anointed many sick people with oil and
healed them.
14King Herod heard about this, for Jesus'
name had become well known. Some
were saying, "John the Baptist has been
raised from the dead, and that is why
miraculous powers are at work in him."
15Others said, "He is Elijah." And still
others claimed, "He is a prophet, like
one of the prophets of long ago."
16But when Herod heard this, he said,
"John, the man I beheaded, has been
raised from the dead!"
17For Herod himself had given orders to
have John arrested, and he had him
bound and put in prison. He did this
because of Herodias, his brother Philip's
wife, whom he had married.
18For John had been saying to Herod, "It
is not lawful for you to have your
brother's wife."
19So Herodias nursed a grudge against
John and wanted to kill him. But she
was not able to,
20because Herod feared John and
protected him, knowing him to be a
righteous and holy man. When Herod
heard John, he was greatly puzzled ; yet
he liked to listen to him.
21Finally the opportune time came. On
his birthday Herod gave a banquet for
his high officials and military
commanders and the leading men of
Galilee.
22When the daughter of Herodias came
in and danced, she pleased Herod and
his dinner guests.
23The king said to the girl, "Ask me for
anything you want, and I'll give it to
you." And he promised her with an oath,
"Whatever you ask I will give you, up to
half my kingdom."
24She went out and said to her mother,
"What shall I ask for?" "The head of
John the Baptist," she answered.
25At once the girl hurried in to the king
with the request: "I want you to give me
right now the head of John the Baptist
on a platter."
26The king was greatly distressed, but
because of his oaths and his dinner
guests, he did not want to refuse her.
27So he immediately sent an executioner
with orders to bring John's head. The
man went, beheaded John in the prison,
28and brought back his head on a platter.
He presented it to the girl, and she gave
it to her mother.
29On hearing of this, John's disciples
came and took his body and laid it in a
tomb.
30The apostles gathered around Jesus
and reported to him all they had done
and taught.
31Then, because so many people were
coming and going that they did not even
have a chance to eat, he said to them,
"Come with me by yourselves to a quiet
place and get some rest."
32So they went away by themselves in a
boat to a solitary place.
33But many who saw them leaving
recognized them and ran on foot from all
the towns and got there ahead of them.
34When Jesus landed and saw a large
crowd, he had compassion on them,
because they were like sheep without a
shepherd. So he began teaching them
many things.
35By this time it was late in the day, so
his disciples came to him. "This is a
remote place," they said, "and it's
already very late.
36Send the people away so they can go
to the surrounding countryside and
villages and buy themselves something
to eat."
37But he answered, "You give them
something to eat." They said to him,
"That would take eight months of a
man's wages ! Are we to go and spend
that much on bread and give it to them
to eat?"
38"How many loaves do you have?" he
asked. "Go and see." When they found
out, they said, "Five--and two fish."
39Then Jesus directed them to have all
the people sit down in groups on the
green grass.
40So they sat down in groups of
hundreds and fifties.
41Taking the five loaves and the two fish
and looking up to heaven, he gave
thanks and broke the loaves. Then he
gave them to his disciples to set before
the people. He also divided the two fish
among them all.
42They all ate and were satisfied,
43and the disciples picked up twelve
basketfuls of broken pieces of bread
and fish.
44The number of the men who had eaten
was five thousand.
45Immediately Jesus made his disciples
get into the boat and go on ahead of him
to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the
crowd.
46After leaving them, he went up on a
mountainside to pray.
47When evening came, the boat was in
the middle of the lake, and he was alone
on land.
48He saw the disciples straining at the
oars, because the wind was against
them. About the fourth watch of the
night he went out to them, walking on
the lake. He was about to pass by them,
49but when they saw him walking on the
lake, they thought he was a ghost. They
cried out,
50because they all saw him and were
terrified.
51Immediately he spoke to them and
said, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be
afraid." Then he climbed into the boat
with them, and the wind died down.
They were completely amazed,
52for they had not understood about the
loaves; their hearts were hardened.
53When they had crossed over, they
landed at Gennesaret and anchored
there.
54As soon as they got out of the boat,
people recognized Jesus.
55They ran throughout that whole region
and carried the sick on mats to
wherever they heard he was.
56And wherever he went--into villages,
towns or countryside--they placed the
sick in the marketplaces. They begged
him to let them touch even the edge of
his cloak, and all who touched him were
healed.
7The Pharisees and some of the
teachers of the law who had come from
Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and
2saw some of his disciples eating food
with hands that were "unclean," that is,
unwashed.
3(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not
eat unless they give their hands a
ceremonial washing, holding to the
tradition of the elders.
4When they come from the marketplace
they do not eat unless they wash. And
they observe many other traditions,
such as the washing of cups, pitchers
and kettles. )
5So the Pharisees and teachers of the
law asked Jesus, "Why don't your
disciples live according to the tradition of
the elders instead of eating their food
with 'unclean' hands?"
6He replied, "Isaiah was right when he
prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is
written: " 'These people honor me with
their lips, but their hearts are far from
me.
7They worship me in vain; their
teachings are but rules taught by men.'
8You have let go of the commands of
God and are holding on to the traditions
of men."
9And he said to them: "You have a fine
way of setting aside the commands of
God in order to observe your own
traditions!
10For Moses said, 'Honor your father
and your mother,' and, 'Anyone who
curses his father or mother must be put
to death.'
11But you say that if a man says to his
father or mother: 'Whatever help you
might otherwise have received from me
is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God),
12then you no longer let him do anything
for his father or mother.
13Thus you nullify the word of God by
your tradition that you have handed
down. And you do many things like
that."
14Again Jesus called the crowd to him
and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and
understand this.
15Nothing outside a man can make him
'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is
what comes out of a man that makes
him 'unclean.' "
17After he had left the crowd and
entered the house, his disciples asked
him about this parable.
18"Are you so dull?" he asked. "Don't
you see that nothing that enters a man
from the outside can make him
'unclean'?
19For it doesn't go into his heart but into
his stomach, and then out of his body."
(In saying this, Jesus declared all foods
"clean.")
20He went on: "What comes out of a
man is what makes him 'unclean.'
21For from within, out of men's hearts,
come evil thoughts, sexual immorality,
theft, murder, adultery,
22greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy,
slander, arrogance and folly.
23All these evils come from inside and
make a man 'unclean.' "
24Jesus left that place and went to the
vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and
did not want anyone to know it; yet he
could not keep his presence secret.
25In fact, as soon as she heard about
him, a woman whose little daughter was
possessed by an evil spirit came and fell
at his feet.
26The woman was a Greek, born in
Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to
drive the demon out of her daughter.
27"First let the children eat all they want,"
he told her, "for it is not right to take the
children's bread and toss it to their
dogs."
28"Yes, Lord," she replied, "but even the
dogs under the table eat the children's
crumbs."
29Then he told her, "For such a reply,
you may go; the demon has left your
daughter."
30She went home and found her child
lying on the bed, and the demon gone.
31Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and
went through Sidon, down to the Sea of
Galilee and into the region of the
Decapolis.
32There some people brought to him a
man who was deaf and could hardly talk,
and they begged him to place his hand
on the man.
33After he took him aside, away from the
crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the
man's ears. Then he spit and touched
the man's tongue.
34He looked up to heaven and with a
deep sigh said to him, "Ephphatha!"
(which means, "Be opened!" ).
35At this, the man's ears were opened,
his tongue was loosened and he began
to speak plainly.
36Jesus commanded them not to tell
anyone. But the more he did so, the
more they kept talking about it.
37People were overwhelmed with
amazement. "He has done everything
well," they said. "He even makes the
deaf hear and the mute speak."
8During those days another large
crowd gathered. Since they had nothing
to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him
and said,
2"I have compassion for these people;
they have already been with me three
days and have nothing to eat.
3If I send them home hungry, they will
collapse on the way, because some of
them have come a long distance."
4His disciples answered, "But where in
this remote place can anyone get
enough bread to feed them?"
5"How many loaves do you have?"
Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied.
6He told the crowd to sit down on the
ground. When he had taken the seven
loaves and given thanks, he broke them
and gave them to his disciples to set
before the people, and they did so.
7They had a few small fish as well; he
gave thanks for them also and told the
disciples to distribute them.
8The people ate and were satisfied.
Afterward the disciples picked up seven
basketfuls of broken pieces that were
left over.
9About four thousand men were present.
And having sent them away,
10he got into the boat with his disciples
and went to the region of Dalmanutha.
11The Pharisees came and began to
question Jesus. To test him, they asked
him for a sign from heaven.
12He sighed deeply and said, "Why does
this generation ask for a miraculous
sign? I tell you the truth, no sign will be
given to it."
13Then he left them, got back into the
boat and crossed to the other side.
14The disciples had forgotten to bring
bread, except for one loaf they had with
them in the boat.
15"Be careful," Jesus warned them.
"Watch out for the yeast of the
Pharisees and that of Herod."
16They discussed this with one another
and said, "It is because we have no
bread."
17Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked
them: "Why are you talking about having
no bread? Do you still not see or
understand? Are your hearts hardened?
18Do you have eyes but fail to see, and
ears but fail to hear? And don't you
remember?
19When I broke the five loaves for the
five thousand, how many basketfuls of
pieces did you pick up?" "Twelve," they
replied.
20"And when I broke the seven loaves
for the four thousand, how many
basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?"
They answered, "Seven."
21He said to them, "Do you still not
understand?"
22They came to Bethsaida, and some
people brought a blind man and begged
Jesus to touch him.
23He took the blind man by the hand and
led him outside the village. When he
had spit on the man's eyes and put his
hands on him, Jesus asked, "Do you
see anything?"
24He looked up and said, "I see people;
they look like trees walking around."
25Once more Jesus put his hands on the
man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened,
his sight was restored, and he saw
everything clearly.
26Jesus sent him home, saying, "Don't
go into the village. "
27Jesus and his disciples went on to the
villages around Caesarea Philippi. On
the way he asked them, "Who do people
say I am?"
28They replied, "Some say John the
Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others,
one of the prophets."
29"But what about you?" he asked. "Who
do you say I am?" Peter answered, "You
are the Christ. "
30Jesus warned them not to tell anyone
about him.
31He then began to teach them that the
Son of Man must suffer many things and
be rejected by the elders, chief priests
and teachers of the law, and that he
must be killed and after three days rise
again.
32He spoke plainly about this, and Peter
took him aside and began to rebuke him.
33But when Jesus turned and looked at
his disciples, he rebuked Peter. "Get
behind me, Satan!" he said. "You do not
have in mind the things of God, but the
things of men."
34Then he called the crowd to him along
with his disciples and said: "If anyone
would come after me, he must deny
himself and take up his cross and follow
me.
35For whoever wants to save his life will
lose it, but whoever loses his life for me
and for the gospel will save it.
36What good is it for a man to gain the
whole world, yet forfeit his soul?
37Or what can a man give in exchange
for his soul?
38If anyone is ashamed of me and my
words in this adulterous and sinful
generation, the Son of Man will be
ashamed of him when he comes in his
Father's glory with the holy angels."
9And he said to them, "I tell you the
truth, some who are standing here will
not taste death before they see the
kingdom of God come with power."
2After six days Jesus took Peter, James
and John with him and led them up a
high mountain, where they were all
alone. There he was transfigured before
them.
3His clothes became dazzling white,
whiter than anyone in the world could
bleach them.
4And there appeared before them Elijah
and Moses, who were talking with Jesus.
5Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good
for us to be here. Let us put up three
shelters--one for you, one for Moses
and one for Elijah."
6(He did not know what to say, they
were so frightened.)
7Then a cloud appeared and enveloped
them, and a voice came from the cloud:
"This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to
him!"
8Suddenly, when they looked around,
they no longer saw anyone with them
except Jesus.
9As they were coming down the
mountain, Jesus gave them orders not
to tell anyone what they had seen until
the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
10They kept the matter to themselves,
discussing what "rising from the dead"
meant.
11And they asked him, "Why do the
teachers of the law say that Elijah must
come first?"
12Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah does
come first, and restores all things. Why
then is it written that the Son of Man
must suffer much and be rejected?
13But I tell you, Elijah has come, and
they have done to him everything they
wished, just as it is written about him."
14When they came to the other disciples,
they saw a large crowd around them
and the teachers of the law arguing with
them.
15As soon as all the people saw Jesus,
they were overwhelmed with wonder
and ran to greet him.
16"What are you arguing with them
about?" he asked.
17A man in the crowd answered,
"Teacher, I brought you my son, who is
possessed by a spirit that has robbed
him of speech.
18Whenever it seizes him, it throws him
to the ground. He foams at the mouth,
gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I
asked your disciples to drive out the
spirit, but they could not."
19"O unbelieving generation," Jesus
replied, "how long shall I stay with you?
How long shall I put up with you? Bring
the boy to me."
20So they brought him. When the spirit
saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy
into a convulsion. He fell to the ground
and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.
21Jesus asked the boy's father, "How
long has he been like this?"
22"From childhood," he answered. "It has
often thrown him into fire or water to kill
him. But if you can do anything, take pity
on us and help us."
23" 'If you can'?" said Jesus. "Everything
is possible for him who believes."
24Immediately the boy's father exclaimed,
"I do believe; help me overcome my
unbelief!"
25When Jesus saw that a crowd was
running to the scene, he rebuked the
evil spirit. "You deaf and mute spirit," he
said, "I command you, come out of him
and never enter him again."
26The spirit shrieked, convulsed him
violently and came out. The boy looked
so much like a corpse that many said,
"He's dead."
27But Jesus took him by the hand and
lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.
28After Jesus had gone indoors, his
disciples asked him privately, "Why
couldn't we drive it out?"
29He replied, "This kind can come out
only by prayer. "
30They left that place and passed
through Galilee. Jesus did not want
anyone to know where they were,
31because he was teaching his disciples.
He said to them, "The Son of Man is
going to be betrayed into the hands of
men. They will kill him, and after three
days he will rise."
32But they did not understand what he
meant and were afraid to ask him about
it.
33They came to Capernaum. When he
was in the house, he asked them, "What
were you arguing about on the road?"
34But they kept quiet because on the
way they had argued about who was the
greatest.
35Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve
and said, "If anyone wants to be first, he
must be the very last, and the servant of
all."
36He took a little child and had him stand
among them. Taking him in his arms, he
said to them,
37"Whoever welcomes one of these little
children in my name welcomes me; and
whoever welcomes me does not
welcome me but the one who sent me."
38"Teacher," said John, "we saw a man
driving out demons in your name and
we told him to stop, because he was not
one of us."
39"Do not stop him," Jesus said. "No one
who does a miracle in my name can in
the next moment say anything bad
about me,
40for whoever is not against us is for us.
41I tell you the truth, anyone who gives
you a cup of water in my name because
you belong to Christ will certainly not
lose his reward.
42"And if anyone causes one of these
little ones who believe in me to sin, it
would be better for him to be thrown into
the sea with a large millstone tied
around his neck.
43If your hand causes you to sin, cut it
off. It is better for you to enter life
maimed than with two hands to go into
hell, where the fire never goes out.
45And if your foot causes you to sin, cut
it off. It is better for you to enter life
crippled than to have two feet and be
thrown into hell.
47And if your eye causes you to sin,
pluck it out. It is better for you to enter
the kingdom of God with one eye than to
have two eyes and be thrown into hell,
48where " 'their worm does not die, and
the fire is not quenched.'
49Everyone will be salted with fire.
50"Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness,
how can you make it salty again? Have
salt in yourselves, and be at peace with
each other."
10Jesus then left that place and
went into the region of Judea and
across the Jordan. Again crowds of
people came to him, and as was his
custom, he taught them.
2Some Pharisees came and tested him
by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to
divorce his wife?"
3"What did Moses command you?" he
replied.
4They said, "Moses permitted a man to
write a certificate of divorce and send
her away."
5"It was because your hearts were hard
that Moses wrote you this law," Jesus
replied.
6"But at the beginning of creation God
'made them male and female.'
7'For this reason a man will leave his
father and mother and be united to his
wife,
8and the two will become one flesh.' So
they are no longer two, but one.
9Therefore what God has joined
together, let man not separate."
10When they were in the house again,
the disciples asked Jesus about this.
11He answered, "Anyone who divorces
his wife and marries another woman
commits adultery against her.
12And if she divorces her husband and
marries another man, she commits
adultery."
13People were bringing little children to
Jesus to have him touch them, but the
disciples rebuked them.
14When Jesus saw this, he was
indignant. He said to them, "Let the little
children come to me, and do not hinder
them, for the kingdom of God belongs to
such as these.
15I tell you the truth, anyone who will not
receive the kingdom of God like a little
child will never enter it."
16And he took the children in his arms,
put his hands on them and blessed
them.
17As Jesus started on his way, a man
ran up to him and fell on his knees
before him. "Good teacher," he asked,
"what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
18"Why do you call me good?" Jesus
answered. "No one is good--except God
alone.
19You know the commandments: 'Do not
murder, do not commit adultery, do not
steal, do not give false testimony, do not
defraud, honor your father and mother.'
"
20"Teacher," he declared, "all these I
have kept since I was a boy."
21Jesus looked at him and loved him.
"One thing you lack," he said. "Go, sell
everything you have and give to the
poor, and you will have treasure in
heaven. Then come, follow me."
22At this the man's face fell. He went
away sad, because he had great wealth.
23Jesus looked around and said to his
disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to
enter the kingdom of God!"
24The disciples were amazed at his
words. But Jesus said again, "Children,
how hard it is to enter the kingdom of
God!
25It is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle than for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of God."
26The disciples were even more amazed,
and said to each other, "Who then can
be saved?"
27Jesus looked at them and said, "With
man this is impossible, but not with God;
all things are possible with God."
28Peter said to him, "We have left
everything to follow you!"
29"I tell you the truth," Jesus replied, "no
one who has left home or brothers or
sisters or mother or father or children or
fields for me and the gospel
30will fail to receive a hundred times as
much in this present age (homes,
brothers, sisters, mothers, children and
fields--and with them, persecutions) and
in the age to come, eternal life.
31But many who are first will be last, and
the last first."
32They were on their way up to
Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way,
and the disciples were astonished, while
those who followed were afraid. Again
he took the Twelve aside and told them
what was going to happen to him.
33"We are going up to Jerusalem," he
said, "and the Son of Man will be
betrayed to the chief priests and
teachers of the law. They will condemn
him to death and will hand him over to
the Gentiles,
34who will mock him and spit on him,
flog him and kill him. Three days later he
will rise."
35Then James and John, the sons of
Zebedee, came to him. "Teacher," they
said, "we want you to do for us whatever
we ask."
36"What do you want me to do for you?"
he asked.
37They replied, "Let one of us sit at your
right and the other at your left in your
glory."
38"You don't know what you are asking,"
Jesus said. "Can you drink the cup I
drink or be baptized with the baptism I
am baptized with?"
39"We can," they answered. Jesus said
to them, "You will drink the cup I drink
and be baptized with the baptism I am
baptized with,
40but to sit at my right or left is not for
me to grant. These places belong to
those for whom they have been
prepared."
41When the ten heard about this, they
became indignant with James and John.
42Jesus called them together and said,
"You know that those who are regarded
as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over
them, and their high officials exercise
authority over them.
43Not so with you. Instead, whoever
wants to become great among you must
be your servant,
44and whoever wants to be first must be
slave of all.
45For even the Son of Man did not come
to be served, but to serve, and to give
his life as a ransom for many."
46Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus
and his disciples, together with a large
crowd, were leaving the city, a blind
man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of
Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside
begging.
47When he heard that it was Jesus of
Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus,
Son of David, have mercy on me!"
48Many rebuked him and told him to be
quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son
of David, have mercy on me!"
49Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So
they called to the blind man, "Cheer up!
On your feet! He's calling you."
50Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped
to his feet and came to Jesus.
51"What do you want me to do for you?"
Jesus asked him. The blind man said,
"Rabbi, I want to see."
52"Go," said Jesus, "your faith has
healed you." Immediately he received
his sight and followed Jesus along the
road.
11As they approached Jerusalem
and came to Bethphage and Bethany at
the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of
his disciples,
2saying to them, "Go to the village
ahead of you, and just as you enter it,
you will find a colt tied there, which no
one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it
here.
3If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing
this?' tell him, 'The Lord needs it and will
send it back here shortly.' "
4They went and found a colt outside in
the street, tied at a doorway. As they
untied it,
5some people standing there asked,
"What are you doing, untying that colt?"
6They answered as Jesus had told them
to, and the people let them go.
7When they brought the colt to Jesus
and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on
it.
8Many people spread their cloaks on the
road, while others spread branches they
had cut in the fields.
9Those who went ahead and those who
followed shouted, "Hosanna! " "Blessed
is he who comes in the name of the
Lord!"
10"Blessed is the coming kingdom of our
father David!" "Hosanna in the highest!"
11Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to
the temple. He looked around at
everything, but since it was already late,
he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.
12The next day as they were leaving
Bethany, Jesus was hungry.
13Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf,
he went to find out if it had any fruit.
When he reached it, he found nothing
but leaves, because it was not the
season for figs.
14Then he said to the tree, "May no one
ever eat fruit from you again." And his
disciples heard him say it.
15On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered
the temple area and began driving out
those who were buying and selling there.
He overturned the tables of the money
changers and the benches of those
selling doves,
16and would not allow anyone to carry
merchandise through the temple courts.
17And as he taught them, he said, "Is it
not written: " 'My house will be called a
house of prayer for all nations' ? But you
have made it 'a den of robbers.' "
18The chief priests and the teachers of
the law heard this and began looking for
a way to kill him, for they feared him,
because the whole crowd was amazed
at his teaching.
19When evening came, they went out of
the city.
20In the morning, as they went along,
they saw the fig tree withered from the
roots.
21Peter remembered and said to Jesus,
"Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed
has withered!"
22"Have faith in God," Jesus answered.
23"I tell you the truth, if anyone says to
this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into
the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart
but believes that what he says will
happen, it will be done for him.
24Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask
for in prayer, believe that you have
received it, and it will be yours.
25And when you stand praying, if you
hold anything against anyone, forgive
him, so that your Father in heaven may
forgive you your sins."
27They arrived again in Jerusalem, and
while Jesus was walking in the temple
courts, the chief priests, the teachers of
the law and the elders came to him.
28"By what authority are you doing these
things?" they asked. "And who gave you
authority to do this?"
29Jesus replied, "I will ask you one
question. Answer me, and I will tell you
by what authority I am doing these
things.
30John's baptism--was it from heaven, or
from men? Tell me!"
31They discussed it among themselves
and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he
will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe
him?'
32But if we say, 'From men'...." (They
feared the people, for everyone held
that John really was a prophet.)
33So they answered Jesus, "We don't
know." Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you
by what authority I am doing these
things."
12He then began to speak to them in
parables: "A man planted a vineyard. He
put a wall around it, dug a pit for the
winepress and built a watchtower. Then
he rented the vineyard to some farmers
and went away on a journey.
2At harvest time he sent a servant to the
tenants to collect from them some of the
fruit of the vineyard.
3But they seized him, beat him and sent
him away empty-handed.
4Then he sent another servant to them;
they struck this man on the head and
treated him shamefully.
5He sent still another, and that one they
killed. He sent many others; some of
them they beat, others they killed.
6"He had one left to send, a son, whom
he loved. He sent him last of all, saying,
'They will respect my son.'
7"But the tenants said to one another,
'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and
the inheritance will be ours.'
8So they took him and killed him, and
threw him out of the vineyard.
9"What then will the owner of the
vineyard do? He will come and kill those
tenants and give the vineyard to others.
10Haven't you read this scripture: " 'The
stone the builders rejected has become
the capstone ;
11the Lord has done this, and it is
marvelous in our eyes' ?"
12Then they looked for a way to arrest
him because they knew he had spoken
the parable against them. But they were
afraid of the crowd; so they left him and
went away.
13Later they sent some of the Pharisees
and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in
his words.
14They came to him and said, "Teacher,
we know you are a man of integrity. You
aren't swayed by men, because you pay
no attention to who they are; but you
teach the way of God in accordance
with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to
Caesar or not?
15Should we pay or shouldn't we?"
16But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. "Why
are you trying to trap me?" he asked.
"Bring me a denarius and let me look at
it." They brought the coin, and he asked
them, "Whose portrait is this? And
whose inscription?" "Caesar's," they
replied.
17Then Jesus said to them, "Give to
Caesar what is Caesar's and to God
what is God's." And they were amazed
at him.
18Then the Sadducees, who say there is
no resurrection, came to him with a
question.
19"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for
us that if a man's brother dies and
leaves a wife but no children, the man
must marry the widow and have children
for his brother.
20Now there were seven brothers. The
first one married and died without
leaving any children.
21The second one married the widow,
but he also died, leaving no child. It was
the same with the third.
22In fact, none of the seven left any
children. Last of all, the woman died too.
23At the resurrection whose wife will she
be, since the seven were married to
her?"
24Jesus replied, "Are you not in error
because you do not know the Scriptures
or the power of God?
25When the dead rise, they will neither
marry nor be given in marriage; they will
be like the angels in heaven.
26Now about the dead rising--have you
not read in the book of Moses, in the
account of the bush, how God said to
him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' ?
27He is not the God of the dead, but of
the living. You are badly mistaken!"
28One of the teachers of the law came
and heard them debating. Noticing that
Jesus had given them a good answer,
he asked him, "Of all the
commandments, which is the most
important?"
29"The most important one," answered
Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord
our God, the Lord is one.
30Love the Lord your God with all your
heart and with all your soul and with all
your mind and with all your strength.'
31The second is this: 'Love your
neighbor as yourself.' There is no
commandment greater than these."
32"Well said, teacher," the man replied.
"You are right in saying that God is one
and there is no other but him.
33To love him with all your heart, with all
your understanding and with all your
strength, and to love your neighbor as
yourself is more important than all burnt
offerings and sacrifices."
34When Jesus saw that he had
answered wisely, he said to him, "You
are not far from the kingdom of God."
And from then on no one dared ask him
any more questions.
35While Jesus was teaching in the
temple courts, he asked, "How is it that
the teachers of the law say that the
Christ is the son of David?
36David himself, speaking by the Holy
Spirit, declared: " 'The Lord said to my
Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put
your enemies under your feet." '
37David himself calls him 'Lord.' How
then can he be his son?" The large
crowd listened to him with delight.
38As he taught, Jesus said, "Watch out
for the teachers of the law. They like to
walk around in flowing robes and be
greeted in the marketplaces,
39and have the most important seats in
the synagogues and the places of honor
at banquets.
40They devour widows' houses and for a
show make lengthy prayers. Such men
will be punished most severely."
41Jesus sat down opposite the place
where the offerings were put and
watched the crowd putting their money
into the temple treasury. Many rich
people threw in large amounts.
42But a poor widow came and put in two
very small copper coins, worth only a
fraction of a penny.
43Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said,
"I tell you the truth, this poor widow has
put more into the treasury than all the
others.
44They all gave out of their wealth; but
she, out of her poverty, put in
everything--all she had to live on."
13As he was leaving the temple, one
of his disciples said to him, "Look,
Teacher! What massive stones! What
magnificent buildings!"
2"Do you see all these great buildings?"
replied Jesus. "Not one stone here will
be left on another; every one will be
thrown down."
3As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of
Olives opposite the temple, Peter,
James, John and Andrew asked him
privately,
4"Tell us, when will these things
happen? And what will be the sign that
they are all about to be fulfilled?"
5Jesus said to them: "Watch out that no
one deceives you.
6Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I
am he,' and will deceive many.
7When you hear of wars and rumors of
wars, do not be alarmed. Such things
must happen, but the end is still to come.
8Nation will rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom. There will be
earthquakes in various places, and
famines. These are the beginning of
birth pains.
9"You must be on your guard. You will
be handed over to the local councils and
flogged in the synagogues. On account
of me you will stand before governors
and kings as witnesses to them.
10And the gospel must first be preached
to all nations.
11Whenever you are arrested and
brought to trial, do not worry beforehand
about what to say. Just say whatever is
given you at the time, for it is not you
speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
12"Brother will betray brother to death,
and a father his child. Children will rebel
against their parents and have them put
to death.
13All men will hate you because of me,
but he who stands firm to the end will be
saved.
14"When you see 'the abomination that
causes desolation' standing where it
does not belong--let the reader
understand--then let those who are in
Judea flee to the mountains.
15Let no one on the roof of his house go
down or enter the house to take
anything out.
16Let no one in the field go back to get
his cloak.
17How dreadful it will be in those days
for pregnant women and nursing
mothers!
18Pray that this will not take place in
winter,
19because those will be days of distress
unequaled from the beginning, when
God created the world, until now--and
never to be equaled again.
20If the Lord had not cut short those
days, no one would survive. But for the
sake of the elect, whom he has chosen,
he has shortened them.
21At that time if anyone says to you,
'Look, here is the Christ !' or, 'Look,
there he is!' do not believe it.
22For false Christs and false prophets
will appear and perform signs and
miracles to deceive the elect--if that
were possible.
23So be on your guard; I have told you
everything ahead of time.
24"But in those days, following that
distress, " 'the sun will be darkened, and
the moon will not give its light;
25the stars will fall from the sky, and the
heavenly bodies will be shaken.'
26"At that time men will see the Son of
Man coming in clouds with great power
and glory.
27And he will send his angels and gather
his elect from the four winds, from the
ends of the earth to the ends of the
heavens.
28"Now learn this lesson from the fig
tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and
its leaves come out, you know that
summer is near.
29Even so, when you see these things
happening, you know that it is near, right
at the door.
30I tell you the truth, this generation will
certainly not pass away until all these
things have happened.
31Heaven and earth will pass away, but
my words will never pass away.
32"No one knows about that day or hour,
not even the angels in heaven, nor the
Son, but only the Father.
33Be on guard! Be alert ! You do not
know when that time will come.
34It's like a man going away: He leaves
his house and puts his servants in
charge, each with his assigned task,
and tells the one at the door to keep
watch.
35"Therefore keep watch because you
do not know when the owner of the
house will come back--whether in the
evening, or at midnight, or when the
rooster crows, or at dawn.
36If he comes suddenly, do not let him
find you sleeping.
37What I say to you, I say to everyone:
'Watch!' "
14Now the Passover and the Feast
of Unleavened Bread were only two
days away, and the chief priests and the
teachers of the law were looking for
some sly way to arrest Jesus and kill
him.
2"But not during the Feast," they said,
"or the people may riot."
3While he was in Bethany, reclining at
the table in the home of a man known
as Simon the Leper, a woman came
with an alabaster jar of very expensive
perfume, made of pure nard. She broke
the jar and poured the perfume on his
head.
4Some of those present were saying
indignantly to one another, "Why this
waste of perfume?
5It could have been sold for more than a
year's wages and the money given to
the poor." And they rebuked her harshly.
6"Leave her alone," said Jesus. "Why
are you bothering her? She has done a
beautiful thing to me.
7The poor you will always have with you,
and you can help them any time you
want. But you will not always have me.
8She did what she could. She poured
perfume on my body beforehand to
prepare for my burial.
9I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel
is preached throughout the world, what
she has done will also be told, in
memory of her."
10Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve,
went to the chief priests to betray Jesus
to them.
11They were delighted to hear this and
promised to give him money. So he
watched for an opportunity to hand him
over.
12On the first day of the Feast of
Unleavened Bread, when it was
customary to sacrifice the Passover
lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him,
"Where do you want us to go and make
preparations for you to eat the
Passover?"
13So he sent two of his disciples, telling
them, "Go into the city, and a man
carrying a jar of water will meet you.
Follow him.
14Say to the owner of the house he
enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my
guest room, where I may eat the
Passover with my disciples?'
15He will show you a large upper room,
furnished and ready. Make preparations
for us there."
16The disciples left, went into the city
and found things just as Jesus had told
them. So they prepared the Passover.
17When evening came, Jesus arrived
with the Twelve.
18While they were reclining at the table
eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one
of you will betray me--one who is eating
with me."
19They were saddened, and one by one
they said to him, "Surely not I?"
20"It is one of the Twelve," he replied,
"one who dips bread into the bowl with
me.
21The Son of Man will go just as it is
written about him. But woe to that man
who betrays the Son of Man! It would be
better for him if he had not been born."
22While they were eating, Jesus took
bread, gave thanks and broke it, and
gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it;
this is my body."
23Then he took the cup, gave thanks
and offered it to them, and they all drank
from it.
24"This is my blood of the covenant,
which is poured out for many," he said
to them.
25"I tell you the truth, I will not drink
again of the fruit of the vine until that
day when I drink it anew in the kingdom
of God."
26When they had sung a hymn, they
went out to the Mount of Olives.
27"You will all fall away," Jesus told them,
"for it is written: " 'I will strike the
shepherd, and the sheep will be
scattered.'
28But after I have risen, I will go ahead
of you into Galilee."
29Peter declared, "Even if all fall away, I
will not."
30"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered,
"today--yes, tonight--before the rooster
crows twice you yourself will disown me
three times."
31But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even
if I have to die with you, I will never
disown you." And all the others said the
same.
32They went to a place called
Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his
disciples, "Sit here while I pray."
33He took Peter, James and John along
with him, and he began to be deeply
distressed and troubled.
34"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow
to the point of death," he said to them.
"Stay here and keep watch."
35Going a little farther, he fell to the
ground and prayed that if possible the
hour might pass from him.
36"Abba, Father," he said, "everything is
possible for you. Take this cup from me.
Yet not what I will, but what you will."
37Then he returned to his disciples and
found them sleeping. "Simon," he said to
Peter, "are you asleep? Could you not
keep watch for one hour?
38Watch and pray so that you will not fall
into temptation. The spirit is willing, but
the body is weak."
39Once more he went away and prayed
the same thing.
40When he came back, he again found
them sleeping, because their eyes were
heavy. They did not know what to say to
him.
41Returning the third time, he said to
them, "Are you still sleeping and
resting? Enough! The hour has come.
Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into
the hands of sinners.
42Rise! Let us go! Here comes my
betrayer!"
43Just as he was speaking, Judas, one
of the Twelve, appeared. With him was
a crowd armed with swords and clubs,
sent from the chief priests, the teachers
of the law, and the elders.
44Now the betrayer had arranged a
signal with them: "The one I kiss is the
man; arrest him and lead him away
under guard."
45Going at once to Jesus, Judas said,
"Rabbi!" and kissed him.
46The men seized Jesus and arrested
him.
47Then one of those standing near drew
his sword and struck the servant of the
high priest, cutting off his ear.
48"Am I leading a rebellion," said Jesus,
"that you have come out with swords
and clubs to capture me?
49Every day I was with you, teaching in
the temple courts, and you did not arrest
me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled."
50Then everyone deserted him and fled.
51A young man, wearing nothing but a
linen garment, was following Jesus.
When they seized him,
52he fled naked, leaving his garment
behind.
53They took Jesus to the high priest, and
all the chief priests, elders and teachers
of the law came together.
54Peter followed him at a distance, right
into the courtyard of the high priest.
There he sat with the guards and
warmed himself at the fire.
55The chief priests and the whole
Sanhedrin were looking for evidence
against Jesus so that they could put him
to death, but they did not find any.
56Many testified falsely against him, but
their statements did not agree.
57Then some stood up and gave this
false testimony against him:
58"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this
man-made temple and in three days will
build another, not made by man.' "
59Yet even then their testimony did not
agree.
60Then the high priest stood up before
them and asked Jesus, "Are you not
going to answer? What is this testimony
that these men are bringing against
you?"
61But Jesus remained silent and gave no
answer. Again the high priest asked him,
"Are you the Christ, the Son of the
Blessed One?"
62"I am," said Jesus. "And you will see
the Son of Man sitting at the right hand
of the Mighty One and coming on the
clouds of heaven."
63The high priest tore his clothes. "Why
do we need any more witnesses?" he
asked.
64"You have heard the blasphemy. What
do you think?"
65They all condemned him as worthy of
death. Then some began to spit at him;
they blindfolded him, struck him with
their fists, and said, "Prophesy!" And the
guards took him and beat him.
66While Peter was below in the
courtyard, one of the servant girls of the
high priest came by.
67When she saw Peter warming himself,
she looked closely at him. "You also
were with that Nazarene, Jesus," she
said.
68But he denied it. "I don't know or
understand what you're talking about,"
he said, and went out into the entryway.
69When the servant girl saw him there,
she said again to those standing around,
"This fellow is one of them."
70Again he denied it. After a little while,
those standing near said to Peter,
"Surely you are one of them, for you are
a Galilean."
71He began to call down curses on
himself, and he swore to them, "I don't
know this man you're talking about."
72Immediately the rooster crowed the
second time. Then Peter remembered
the word Jesus had spoken to him:
"Before the rooster crows twice you will
disown me three times." And he broke
down and wept.
15Very early in the morning, the
chief priests, with the elders, the
teachers of the law and the whole
Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They
bound Jesus, led him away and handed
him over to Pilate.
2"Are you the king of the Jews?" asked
Pilate. "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus
replied.
3The chief priests accused him of many
things.
4So again Pilate asked him, "Aren't you
going to answer? See how many things
they are accusing you of."
5But Jesus still made no reply, and
Pilate was amazed.
6Now it was the custom at the Feast to
release a prisoner whom the people
requested.
7A man called Barabbas was in prison
with the insurrectionists who had
committed murder in the uprising.
8The crowd came up and asked Pilate to
do for them what he usually did.
9"Do you want me to release to you the
king of the Jews?" asked Pilate,
10knowing it was out of envy that the
chief priests had handed Jesus over to
him.
11But the chief priests stirred up the
crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas
instead.
12"What shall I do, then, with the one
you call the king of the Jews?" Pilate
asked them.
13"Crucify him!" they shouted.
14"Why? What crime has he
committed?" asked Pilate. But they
shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
15Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate
released Barabbas to them. He had
Jesus flogged, and handed him over to
be crucified.
16The soldiers led Jesus away into the
palace (that is, the Praetorium) and
called together the whole company of
soldiers.
17They put a purple robe on him, then
twisted together a crown of thorns and
set it on him.
18And they began to call out to him, "Hail,
king of the Jews!"
19Again and again they struck him on
the head with a staff and spit on him.
Falling on their knees, they paid
homage to him.
20And when they had mocked him, they
took off the purple robe and put his own
clothes on him. Then they led him out to
crucify him.
21A certain man from Cyrene, Simon,
the father of Alexander and Rufus, was
passing by on his way in from the
country, and they forced him to carry the
cross.
22They brought Jesus to the place called
Golgotha (which means The Place of
the Skull).
23Then they offered him wine mixed with
myrrh, but he did not take it.
24And they crucified him. Dividing up his
clothes, they cast lots to see what each
would get.
25It was the third hour when they
crucified him.
26The written notice of the charge
against him read: THE KING OF THE
JEWS.
27They crucified two robbers with him,
one on his right and one on his left.
29Those who passed by hurled insults at
him, shaking their heads and saying,
"So! You who are going to destroy the
temple and build it in three days,
30come down from the cross and save
yourself!"
31In the same way the chief priests and
the teachers of the law mocked him
among themselves. "He saved others,"
they said, "but he can't save himself!
32Let this Christ, this King of Israel,
come down now from the cross, that we
may see and believe." Those crucified
with him also heaped insults on him.
33At the sixth hour darkness came over
the whole land until the ninth hour.
34And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out
in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama
sabachthani?"--which means, "My God,
my God, why have you forsaken me?"
35When some of those standing near
heard this, they said, "Listen, he's
calling Elijah."
36One man ran, filled a sponge with wine
vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it
to Jesus to drink. "Now leave him alone.
Let's see if Elijah comes to take him
down," he said.
37With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his
last.
38The curtain of the temple was torn in
two from top to bottom.
39And when the centurion, who stood
there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and
saw how he died, he said, "Surely this
man was the Son of God!"
40Some women were watching from a
distance. Among them were Mary
Magdalene, Mary the mother of James
the younger and of Joses, and Salome.
41In Galilee these women had followed
him and cared for his needs. Many other
women who had come up with him to
Jerusalem were also there.
42It was Preparation Day (that is, the day
before the Sabbath). So as evening
approached,
43Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent
member of the Council, who was himself
waiting for the kingdom of God, went
boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus'
body.
44Pilate was surprised to hear that he
was already dead. Summoning the
centurion, he asked him if Jesus had
already died.
45When he learned from the centurion
that it was so, he gave the body to
Joseph.
46So Joseph bought some linen cloth,
took down the body, wrapped it in the
linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of
rock. Then he rolled a stone against the
entrance of the tomb.
47Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother
of Joses saw where he was laid.
16When the Sabbath was over,
Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of
James, and Salome bought spices so
that they might go to anoint Jesus' body.
2Very early on the first day of the week,
just after sunrise, they were on their way
to the tomb
3and they asked each other, "Who will
roll the stone away from the entrance of
the tomb?"
4But when they looked up, they saw that
the stone, which was very large, had
been rolled away.
5As they entered the tomb, they saw a
young man dressed in a white robe
sitting on the right side, and they were
alarmed.
6"Don't be alarmed," he said. "You are
looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who
was crucified. He has risen! He is not
here. See the place where they laid him.
7But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He
is going ahead of you into Galilee. There
you will see him, just as he told you.' "
8Trembling and bewildered, the women
went out and fled from the tomb. They
said nothing to anyone, because they
were afraid.
9When Jesus rose early on the first day
of the week, he appeared first to Mary
Magdalene, out of whom he had driven
seven demons.
10She went and told those who had
been with him and who were mourning
and weeping.
11When they heard that Jesus was alive
and that she had seen him, they did not
believe it.
12Afterward Jesus appeared in a
different form to two of them while they
were walking in the country.
13These returned and reported it to the
rest; but they did not believe them either.
14Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as
they were eating; he rebuked them for
their lack of faith and their stubborn
refusal to believe those who had seen
him after he had risen.
15He said to them, "Go into all the world
and preach the good news to all
creation.
16Whoever believes and is baptized will
be saved, but whoever does not believe
will be condemned.
17And these signs will accompany those
who believe: In my name they will drive
out demons; they will speak in new
tongues;
18they will pick up snakes with their
hands; and when they drink deadly
poison, it will not hurt them at all; they
will place their hands on sick people,
and they will get well."
19After the Lord Jesus had spoken to
them, he was taken up into heaven and
he sat at the right hand of God.
20Then the disciples went out and
preached everywhere, and the Lord
worked with them and confirmed his
word by the signs that accompanied it.
Luke
1Many have undertaken to draw up an
account of the things that have been
fulfilled among us,
2just as they were handed down to us by
those who from the first were
eyewitnesses and servants of the word.
3Therefore, since I myself have carefully
investigated everything from the
beginning, it seemed good also to me to
write an orderly account for you, most
excellent Theophilus,
4so that you may know the certainty of
the things you have been taught.
5In the time of Herod king of Judea there
was a priest named Zechariah, who
belonged to the priestly division of
Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a
descendant of Aaron.
6Both of them were upright in the sight
of God, observing all the Lord's
commandments and regulations
blamelessly.
7But they had no children, because
Elizabeth was barren; and they were
both well along in years.
8Once when Zechariah's division was on
duty and he was serving as priest before
God,
9he was chosen by lot, according to the
custom of the priesthood, to go into the
temple of the Lord and burn incense.
10And when the time for the burning of
incense came, all the assembled
worshipers were praying outside.
11Then an angel of the Lord appeared to
him, standing at the right side of the
altar of incense.
12When Zechariah saw him, he was
startled and was gripped with fear.
13But the angel said to him: "Do not be
afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been
heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you
a son, and you are to give him the name
John.
14He will be a joy and delight to you, and
many will rejoice because of his birth,
15for he will be great in the sight of the
Lord. He is never to take wine or other
fermented drink, and he will be filled
with the Holy Spirit even from birth.
16Many of the people of Israel will he
bring back to the Lord their God.
17And he will go on before the Lord, in
the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the
hearts of the fathers to their children and
the disobedient to the wisdom of the
righteous--to make ready a people
prepared for the Lord."
18Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I
be sure of this? I am an old man and my
wife is well along in years."
19The angel answered, "I am Gabriel. I
stand in the presence of God, and I
have been sent to speak to you and to
tell you this good news.
20And now you will be silent and not able
to speak until the day this happens,
because you did not believe my words,
which will come true at their proper
time."
21Meanwhile, the people were waiting
for Zechariah and wondering why he
stayed so long in the temple.
22When he came out, he could not
speak to them. They realized he had
seen a vision in the temple, for he kept
making signs to them but remained
unable to speak.
23When his time of service was
completed, he returned home.
24After this his wife Elizabeth became
pregnant and for five months remained
in seclusion.
25"The Lord has done this for me," she
said. "In these days he has shown his
favor and taken away my disgrace
among the people."
26In the sixth month, God sent the angel
Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,
27to a virgin pledged to be married to a
man named Joseph, a descendant of
David. The virgin's name was Mary.
28The angel went to her and said,
"Greetings, you who are highly favored!
The Lord is with you."
29Mary was greatly troubled at his words
and wondered what kind of greeting this
might be.
30But the angel said to her, "Do not be
afraid, Mary, you have found favor with
God.
31You will be with child and give birth to
a son, and you are to give him the name
Jesus.
32He will be great and will be called the
Son of the Most High. The Lord God will
give him the throne of his father David,
33and he will reign over the house of
Jacob forever; his kingdom will never
end."
34"How will this be," Mary asked the
angel, "since I am a virgin?"
35The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit
will come upon you, and the power of
the Most High will overshadow you. So
the holy one to be born will be called the
Son of God.
36Even Elizabeth your relative is going to
have a child in her old age, and she who
was said to be barren is in her sixth
month.
37For nothing is impossible with God."
38"I am the Lord's servant," Mary
answered. "May it be to me as you have
said." Then the angel left her.
39At that time Mary got ready and
hurried to a town in the hill country of
Judea,
40where she entered Zechariah's home
and greeted Elizabeth.
41When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting,
the baby leaped in her womb, and
Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
42In a loud voice she exclaimed:
"Blessed are you among women, and
blessed is the child you will bear!
43But why am I so favored, that the
mother of my Lord should come to me?
44As soon as the sound of your greeting
reached my ears, the baby in my womb
leaped for joy.
45Blessed is she who has believed that
what the Lord has said to her will be
accomplished!"
46And Mary said: "My soul glorifies the
Lord
47and my spirit rejoices in God my
Savior,
48for he has been mindful of the humble
state of his servant. From now on all
generations will call me blessed,
49for the Mighty One has done great
things for me-- holy is his name.
50His mercy extends to those who fear
him, from generation to generation.
51He has performed mighty deeds with
his arm; he has scattered those who are
proud in their inmost thoughts.
52He has brought down rulers from their
thrones but has lifted up the humble.
53He has filled the hungry with good
things but has sent the rich away empty.
54He has helped his servant Israel,
remembering to be merciful
55to Abraham and his descendants
forever, even as he said to our fathers."
56Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about
three months and then returned home.
57When it was time for Elizabeth to have
her baby, she gave birth to a son.
58Her neighbors and relatives heard that
the Lord had shown her great mercy,
and they shared her joy.
59On the eighth day they came to
circumcise the child, and they were
going to name him after his father
Zechariah,
60but his mother spoke up and said, "No!
He is to be called John."
61They said to her, "There is no one
among your relatives who has that
name."
62Then they made signs to his father, to
find out what he would like to name the
child.
63He asked for a writing tablet, and to
everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His
name is John."
64Immediately his mouth was opened
and his tongue was loosed, and he
began to speak, praising God.
65The neighbors were all filled with awe,
and throughout the hill country of Judea
people were talking about all these
things.
66Everyone who heard this wondered
about it, asking, "What then is this child
going to be?" For the Lord's hand was
with him.
67His father Zechariah was filled with the
Holy Spirit and prophesied:
68"Praise be to the Lord, the God of
Israel, because he has come and has
redeemed his people.
69He has raised up a horn of salvation
for us in the house of his servant David
70(as he said through his holy prophets
of long ago),
71salvation from our enemies and from
the hand of all who hate us--
72to show mercy to our fathers and to
remember his holy covenant,
73the oath he swore to our father
Abraham:
74to rescue us from the hand of our
enemies, and to enable us to serve him
without fear
75in holiness and righteousness before
him all our days.
76And you, my child, will be called a
prophet of the Most High; for you will go
on before the Lord to prepare the way
for him,
77to give his people the knowledge of
salvation through the forgiveness of
their sins,
78because of the tender mercy of our
God, by which the rising sun will come
to us from heaven
79to shine on those living in darkness
and in the shadow of death, to guide our
feet into the path of peace."
80And the child grew and became strong
in spirit; and he lived in the desert until
he appeared publicly to Israel.
2In those days Caesar Augustus
issued a decree that a census should be
taken of the entire Roman world.
2(This was the first census that took
place while Quirinius was governor of
Syria.)
3And everyone went to his own town to
register.
4So Joseph also went up from the town
of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to
Bethlehem the town of David, because
he belonged to the house and line of
David.
5He went there to register with Mary,
who was pledged to be married to him
and was expecting a child.
6While they were there, the time came
for the baby to be born,
7and she gave birth to her firstborn, a
son. She wrapped him in cloths and
placed him in a manger, because there
was no room for them in the inn.
8And there were shepherds living out in
the fields nearby, keeping watch over
their flocks at night.
9An angel of the Lord appeared to them,
and the glory of the Lord shone around
them, and they were terrified.
10But the angel said to them, "Do not be
afraid. I bring you good news of great
joy that will be for all the people.
11Today in the town of David a Savior
has been born to you; he is Christ the
Lord.
12This will be a sign to you: You will find
a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a
manger."
13Suddenly a great company of the
heavenly host appeared with the angel,
praising God and saying,
14"Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth peace to men on whom his favor
rests."
15When the angels had left them and
gone into heaven, the shepherds said to
one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and
see this thing that has happened, which
the Lord has told us about."
16So they hurried off and found Mary
and Joseph, and the baby, who was
lying in the manger.
17When they had seen him, they spread
the word concerning what had been told
them about this child,
18and all who heard it were amazed at
what the shepherds said to them.
19But Mary treasured up all these things
and pondered them in her heart.
20The shepherds returned, glorifying and
praising God for all the things they had
heard and seen, which were just as they
had been told.
21On the eighth day, when it was time to
circumcise him, he was named Jesus,
the name the angel had given him
before he had been conceived.
22When the time of their purification
according to the Law of Moses had
been completed, Joseph and Mary took
him to Jerusalem to present him to the
Lord
23(as it is written in the Law of the Lord,
"Every firstborn male is to be
consecrated to the Lord" ),
24and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with
what is said in the Law of the Lord: "a
pair of doves or two young pigeons."
25Now there was a man in Jerusalem
called Simeon, who was righteous and
devout. He was waiting for the
consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit
was upon him.
26It had been revealed to him by the
Holy Spirit that he would not die before
he had seen the Lord's Christ.
27Moved by the Spirit, he went into the
temple courts. When the parents
brought in the child Jesus to do for him
what the custom of the Law required,
28Simeon took him in his arms and
praised God, saying:
29"Sovereign Lord, as you have
promised, you now dismiss your servant
in peace.
30For my eyes have seen your salvation,
31which you have prepared in the sight
of all people,
32a light for revelation to the Gentiles
and for glory to your people Israel."
33The child's father and mother
marveled at what was said about him.
34Then Simeon blessed them and said
to Mary, his mother: "This child is
destined to cause the falling and rising
of many in Israel, and to be a sign that
will be spoken against,
35so that the thoughts of many hearts
will be revealed. And a sword will pierce
your own soul too."
36There was also a prophetess, Anna,
the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of
Asher. She was very old; she had lived
with her husband seven years after her
marriage,
37and then was a widow until she was
eighty-four. She never left the temple
but worshiped night and day, fasting and
praying.
38Coming up to them at that very
moment, she gave thanks to God and
spoke about the child to all who were
looking forward to the redemption of
Jerusalem.
39When Joseph and Mary had done
everything required by the Law of the
Lord, they returned to Galilee to their
own town of Nazareth.
40And the child grew and became
strong; he was filled with wisdom, and
the grace of God was upon him.
41Every year his parents went to
Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover.
42When he was twelve years old, they
went up to the Feast, according to the
custom.
43After the Feast was over, while his
parents were returning home, the boy
Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but
they were unaware of it.
44Thinking he was in their company,
they traveled on for a day. Then they
began looking for him among their
relatives and friends.
45When they did not find him, they went
back to Jerusalem to look for him.
46After three days they found him in the
temple courts, sitting among the
teachers, listening to them and asking
them questions.
47Everyone who heard him was amazed
at his understanding and his answers.
48When his parents saw him, they were
astonished. His mother said to him,
"Son, why have you treated us like this?
Your father and I have been anxiously
searching for you."
49"Why were you searching for me?" he
asked. "Didn't you know I had to be in
my Father's house?"
50But they did not understand what he
was saying to them.
51Then he went down to Nazareth with
them and was obedient to them. But his
mother treasured all these things in her
heart.
52And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature,
and in favor with God and men.
3In the fifteenth year of the reign of
Tiberius Caesar--when Pontius Pilate
was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch
of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of
Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias
tetrarch of Abilene--
2during the high priesthood of Annas
and Caiaphas, the word of God came to
John son of Zechariah in the desert.
3He went into all the country around the
Jordan, preaching a baptism of
repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
4As is written in the book of the words of
Isaiah the prophet: "A voice of one
calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way
for the Lord, make straight paths for him.
5Every valley shall be filled in, every
mountain and hill made low. The
crooked roads shall become straight,
the rough ways smooth.
6And all mankind will see God's
salvation.' "
7John said to the crowds coming out to
be baptized by him, "You brood of
vipers! Who warned you to flee from the
coming wrath?
8Produce fruit in keeping with
repentance. And do not begin to say to
yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our
father.' For I tell you that out of these
stones God can raise up children for
Abraham.
9The ax is already at the root of the
trees, and every tree that does not
produce good fruit will be cut down and
thrown into the fire."
10"What should we do then?" the crowd
asked.
11John answered, "The man with two
tunics should share with him who has
none, and the one who has food should
do the same."
12Tax collectors also came to be
baptized. "Teacher," they asked, "what
should we do?"
13"Don't collect any more than you are
required to," he told
14them. Then some soldiers asked him,
"And what should we do?" He replied,
"Don't extort money and don't accuse
people falsely--be content with your
pay."
15The people were waiting expectantly
and were all wondering in their hearts if
John might possibly be the Christ.
16John answered them all, "I baptize you
with water. But one more powerful than I
will come, the thongs of whose sandals I
am not worthy to untie. He will baptize
you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
17His winnowing fork is in his hand to
clear his threshing floor and to gather
the wheat into his barn, but he will burn
up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
18And with many other words John
exhorted the people and preached the
good news to them.
19But when John rebuked Herod the
tetrarch because of Herodias, his
brother's wife, and all the other evil
things he had done,
20Herod added this to them all: He
locked John up in prison.
21When all the people were being
baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And
as he was praying, heaven was opened
22and the Holy Spirit descended on him
in bodily form like a dove. And a voice
came from heaven: "You are my Son,
whom I love; with you I am well
pleased."
23Now Jesus himself was about thirty
years old when he began his ministry.
He was the son, so it was thought, of
Joseph,
24the son of Heli, the son of Matthat, the
son of Levi, the son of Melki, the son of
Jannai, the son of Joseph,
25the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos,
the son of Nahum, the son of Esli,
26the son of Naggai, the son of Maath,
the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein,
the son of Josech, the son of Joda,
27the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa,
the son of Zerubbabel, the son of
Shealtiel,
28the son of Neri, the son of Melki, the
son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son
of Elmadam, the son of Er,
29the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer,
the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat,
30the son of Levi, the son of Simeon, the
son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the
son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,
31the son of Melea, the son of Menna,
the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan,
32the son of David, the son of Jesse, the
son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of
Salmon, the son of Nahshon,
33the son of Amminadab, the son of
Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of
Perez,
34the son of Judah, the son of Jacob, the
son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the
son of Terah, the son of Nahor,
35the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the
son of Peleg, the son of Eber,
36the son of Shelah, the son of Cainan,
the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem,
the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
37the son of Methuselah, the son of
Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of
Mahalalel,
38the son of Kenan, the son of Enosh,
the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the
son of God.
4Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned
from the Jordan and was led by the
Spirit in the desert,
2where for forty days he was tempted by
the devil. He ate nothing during those
days, and at the end of them he was
hungry.
3The devil said to him, "If you are the
Son of God, tell this stone to become
bread."
4Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man
does not live on bread alone.' "
5The devil led him up to a high place
and showed him in an instant all the
kingdoms of the world.
6And he said to him, "I will give you all
their authority and splendor, for it has
been given to me, and I can give it to
anyone I want to.
7So if you worship me, it will all be
yours."
8Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Worship
the Lord your God and serve him only.' "
9The devil led him to Jerusalem and had
him stand on the highest point of the
temple. "If you are the Son of God," he
said, "throw yourself down from here.
10For it is written: " 'He will command his
angels concerning you to guard you
carefully;
11they will lift you up in their hands, so
that you will not strike your foot against
a stone.' "
12Jesus answered, "It says: 'Do not put
the Lord your God to the test.' "
13When the devil had finished all this
tempting, he left him until an opportune
time.
14Jesus returned to Galilee in the power
of the Spirit, and news about him spread
through the whole countryside.
15He taught in their synagogues, and
everyone praised him.
16He went to Nazareth, where he had
been brought up, and on the Sabbath
day he went into the synagogue, as was
his custom. And he stood up to read.
17The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was
handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the
place where it is written:
18"The Spirit of the Lord is on me,
because he has anointed me to preach
good news to the poor. He has sent me
to proclaim freedom for the prisoners
and recovery of sight for the blind, to
release the oppressed,
19to proclaim the year of the Lord's
favor."
20Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it
back to the attendant and sat down. The
eyes of everyone in the synagogue were
fastened on him,
21and he began by saying to them,
"Today this scripture is fulfilled in your
hearing."
22All spoke well of him and were
amazed at the gracious words that
came from his lips. "Isn't this Joseph's
son?" they asked.
23Jesus said to them, "Surely you will
quote this proverb to me: 'Physician,
heal yourself! Do here in your hometown
what we have heard that you did in
Capernaum.' "
24"I tell you the truth," he continued, "no
prophet is accepted in his hometown.
25I assure you that there were many
widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when
the sky was shut for three and a half
years and there was a severe famine
throughout the land.
26Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them,
but to a widow in Zarephath in the
region of Sidon.
27And there were many in Israel with
leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet,
yet not one of them was cleansed--only
Naaman the Syrian."
28All the people in the synagogue were
furious when they heard this.
29They got up, drove him out of the town,
and took him to the brow of the hill on
which the town was built, in order to
throw him down the cliff.
30But he walked right through the crowd
and went on his way.
31Then he went down to Capernaum, a
town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath
began to teach the people.
32They were amazed at his teaching,
because his message had authority.
33In the synagogue there was a man
possessed by a demon, an evil spirit. He
cried out at the top of his voice,
34"Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus
of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy
us? I know who you are--the Holy One
of God!"
35"Be quiet!" Jesus said sternly. "Come
out of him!" Then the demon threw the
man down before them all and came out
without injuring him.
36All the people were amazed and said
to each other, "What is this teaching?
With authority and power he gives
orders to evil spirits and they come out!"
37And the news about him spread
throughout the surrounding area.
38Jesus left the synagogue and went to
the home of Simon. Now Simon's
mother-in-law was suffering from a high
fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.
39So he bent over her and rebuked the
fever, and it left her. She got up at once
and began to wait on them.
40When the sun was setting, the people
brought to Jesus all who had various
kinds of sickness, and laying his hands
on each one, he healed them.
41Moreover, demons came out of many
people, shouting, "You are the Son of
God!" But he rebuked them and would
not allow them to speak, because they
knew he was the Christ.
42At daybreak Jesus went out to a
solitary place. The people were looking
for him and when they came to where
he was, they tried to keep him from
leaving them.
43But he said, "I must preach the good
news of the kingdom of God to the other
towns also, because that is why I was
sent."
44And he kept on preaching in the
synagogues of Judea.
5One day as Jesus was standing by
the Lake of Gennesaret, with the people
crowding around him and listening to the
word of God,
2he saw at the water's edge two boats,
left there by the fishermen, who were
washing their nets.
3He got into one of the boats, the one
belonging to Simon, and asked him to
put out a little from shore. Then he sat
down and taught the people from the
boat.
4When he had finished speaking, he
said to Simon, "Put out into deep water,
and let down the nets for a catch."
5Simon answered, "Master, we've
worked hard all night and haven't caught
anything. But because you say so, I will
let down the nets."
6When they had done so, they caught
such a large number of fish that their
nets began to break.
7So they signaled their partners in the
other boat to come and help them, and
they came and filled both boats so full
that they began to sink.
8When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at
Jesus' knees and said, "Go away from
me, Lord; I am a sinful man!"
9For he and all his companions were
astonished at the catch of fish they had
taken,
10and so were James and John, the
sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners.
11Then Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be
afraid; from now on you will catch men."
So they pulled their boats up on shore,
left everything and followed him.
12While Jesus was in one of the towns, a
man came along who was covered with
leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell
with his face to the ground and begged
him, "Lord, if you are willing, you can
make me clean."
13Jesus reached out his hand and
touched the man. "I am willing," he said.
"Be clean!" And immediately the leprosy
left him.
14Then Jesus ordered him, "Don't tell
anyone, but go, show yourself to the
priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses
commanded for your cleansing, as a
testimony to them."
15Yet the news about him spread all the
more, so that crowds of people came to
hear him and to be healed of their
sicknesses.
16But Jesus often withdrew to lonely
places and prayed.
17One day as he was teaching,
Pharisees and teachers of the law, who
had come from every village of Galilee
and from Judea and Jerusalem, were
sitting there. And the power of the Lord
was present for him to heal the sick.
18Some men came carrying a paralytic
on a mat and tried to take him into the
house to lay him before Jesus.
19When they could not find a way to do
this because of the crowd, they went up
on the roof and lowered him on his mat
through the tiles into the middle of the
crowd, right in front of Jesus.
20When Jesus saw their faith, he said,
"Friend, your sins are forgiven."
21The Pharisees and the teachers of the
law began thinking to themselves, "Who
is this fellow who speaks blasphemy?
Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
22Jesus knew what they were thinking
and asked, "Why are you thinking these
things in your hearts?
23Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are
forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
24But that you may know that the Son of
Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins...." He said to the paralyzed man, "I
tell you, get up, take your mat and go
home."
25Immediately he stood up in front of
them, took what he had been lying on
and went home praising God.
26Everyone was amazed and gave
praise to God. They were filled with awe
and said, "We have seen remarkable
things today."
27After this, Jesus went out and saw a
tax collector by the name of Levi sitting
at his tax booth. "Follow me," Jesus said
to him,
28and Levi got up, left everything and
followed him.
29Then Levi held a great banquet for
Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of
tax collectors and others were eating
with them.
30But the Pharisees and the teachers of
the law who belonged to their sect
complained to his disciples, "Why do
you eat and drink with tax collectors and
'sinners'?"
31Jesus answered them, "It is not the
healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
32I have not come to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance."
33They said to him, "John's disciples
often fast and pray, and so do the
disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go
on eating and drinking."
34Jesus answered, "Can you make the
guests of the bridegroom fast while he is
with them?
35But the time will come when the
bridegroom will be taken from them; in
those days they will fast."
36He told them this parable: "No one
tears a patch from a new garment and
sews it on an old one. If he does, he will
have torn the new garment, and the
patch from the new will not match the
old.
37And no one pours new wine into old
wineskins. If he does, the new wine will
burst the skins, the wine will run out and
the wineskins will be ruined.
38No, new wine must be poured into new
wineskins.
39And no one after drinking old wine
wants the new, for he says, 'The old is
better.' "
6One Sabbath Jesus was going
through the grainfields, and his disciples
began to pick some heads of grain, rub
them in their hands and eat the kernels.
2Some of the Pharisees asked, "Why
are you doing what is unlawful on the
Sabbath?"
3Jesus answered them, "Have you
never read what David did when he and
his companions were hungry?
4He entered the house of God, and
taking the consecrated bread, he ate
what is lawful only for priests to eat. And
he also gave some to his companions."
5Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of
Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
6On another Sabbath he went into the
synagogue and was teaching, and a
man was there whose right hand was
shriveled.
7The Pharisees and the teachers of the
law were looking for a reason to accuse
Jesus, so they watched him closely to
see if he would heal on the Sabbath.
8But Jesus knew what they were
thinking and said to the man with the
shriveled hand, "Get up and stand in
front of everyone." So he got up and
stood there.
9Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you,
which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do
good or to do evil, to save life or to
destroy it?"
10He looked around at them all, and then
said to the man, "Stretch out your hand."
He did so, and his hand was completely
restored.
11But they were furious and began to
discuss with one another what they
might do to Jesus.
12One of those days Jesus went out to a
mountainside to pray, and spent the
night praying to God.
13When morning came, he called his
disciples to him and chose twelve of
them, whom he also designated
apostles:
14Simon (whom he named Peter), his
brother Andrew, James, John, Philip,
Bartholomew,
15Matthew, Thomas, James son of
Alphaeus, Simon who was called the
Zealot,
16Judas son of James, and Judas
Iscariot, who became a traitor.
17He went down with them and stood on
a level place. A large crowd of his
disciples was there and a great number
of people from all over Judea, from
Jerusalem, and from the coast of Tyre
and Sidon,
18who had come to hear him and to be
healed of their diseases. Those troubled
by evil spirits were cured,
19and the people all tried to touch him,
because power was coming from him
and healing them all.
20Looking at his disciples, he said:
"Blessed are you who are poor, for
yours is the kingdom of God.
21Blessed are you who hunger now, for
you will be satisfied. Blessed are you
who weep now, for you will laugh.
22Blessed are you when men hate you,
when they exclude you and insult you
and reject your name as evil, because of
the Son of Man.
23"Rejoice in that day and leap for joy,
because great is your reward in heaven.
For that is how their fathers treated the
prophets.
24"But woe to you who are rich, for you
have already received your comfort.
25Woe to you who are well fed now, for
you will go hungry. Woe to you who
laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.
26Woe to you when all men speak well
of you, for that is how their fathers
treated the false prophets.
27"But I tell you who hear me: Love your
enemies, do good to those who hate
you,
28bless those who curse you, pray for
those who mistreat you.
29If someone strikes you on one cheek,
turn to him the other also. If someone
takes your cloak, do not stop him from
taking your tunic.
30Give to everyone who asks you, and if
anyone takes what belongs to you, do
not demand it back.
31Do to others as you would have them
do to you.
32"If you love those who love you, what
credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' love
those who love them.
33And if you do good to those who are
good to you, what credit is that to you?
Even 'sinners' do that.
34And if you lend to those from whom
you expect repayment, what credit is
that to you? Even 'sinners' lend to
'sinners,' expecting to be repaid in full.
35But love your enemies, do good to
them, and lend to them without
expecting to get anything back. Then
your reward will be great, and you will
be sons of the Most High, because he is
kind to the ungrateful and wicked.
36Be merciful, just as your Father is
merciful.
37"Do not judge, and you will not be
judged. Do not condemn, and you will
not be condemned. Forgive, and you will
be forgiven.
38Give, and it will be given to you. A
good measure, pressed down, shaken
together and running over, will be
poured into your lap. For with the
measure you use, it will be measured to
you."
39He also told them this parable: "Can a
blind man lead a blind man? Will they
not both fall into a pit?
40A student is not above his teacher, but
everyone who is fully trained will be like
his teacher.
41"Why do you look at the speck of
sawdust in your brother's eye and pay
no attention to the plank in your own
eye?
42How can you say to your brother,
'Brother, let me take the speck out of
your eye,' when you yourself fail to see
the plank in your own eye? You
hypocrite, first take the plank out of your
eye, and then you will see clearly to
remove the speck from your brother's
eye.
43"No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does
a bad tree bear good fruit.
44Each tree is recognized by its own fruit.
People do not pick figs from
thornbushes, or grapes from briers.
45The good man brings good things out
of the good stored up in his heart, and
the evil man brings evil things out of the
evil stored up in his heart. For out of the
overflow of his heart his mouth speaks.
46"Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and
do not do what I say?
47I will show you what he is like who
comes to me and hears my words and
puts them into practice.
48He is like a man building a house, who
dug down deep and laid the foundation
on rock. When a flood came, the torrent
struck that house but could not shake it,
because it was well built.
49But the one who hears my words and
does not put them into practice is like a
man who built a house on the ground
without a foundation. The moment the
torrent struck that house, it collapsed
and its destruction was complete."
7When Jesus had finished saying all
this in the hearing of the people, he
entered Capernaum.
2There a centurion's servant, whom his
master valued highly, was sick and
about to die.
3The centurion heard of Jesus and sent
some elders of the Jews to him, asking
him to come and heal his servant.
4When they came to Jesus, they
pleaded earnestly with him, "This man
deserves to have you do this,
5because he loves our nation and has
built our synagogue."
6So Jesus went with them.
7He was not far from the house when
the centurion sent friends to say to him:
"Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not
deserve to have you come under my
roof. That is why I did not even consider
myself worthy to come to you. But say
the word, and my servant will be healed.
8For I myself am a man under authority,
with soldiers under me. I tell this one,
'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,'
and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do
this,' and he does it."
9When Jesus heard this, he was
amazed at him, and turning to the crowd
following him, he said, "I tell you, I have
not found such great faith even in
Israel."
10Then the men who had been sent
returned to the house and found the
servant well.
11Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town
called Nain, and his disciples and a
large crowd went along with him.
12As he approached the town gate, a
dead person was being carried out--the
only son of his mother, and she was a
widow. And a large crowd from the town
was with her.
13When the Lord saw her, his heart went
out to her and he said, "Don't cry."
14Then he went up and touched the
coffin, and those carrying it stood still.
He said, "Young man, I say to you, get
up!"
15The dead man sat up and began to
talk, and Jesus gave him back to his
mother.
16They were all filled with awe and
praised God. "A great prophet has
appeared among us," they said. "God
has come to help his people."
17This news about Jesus spread
throughout Judea and the surrounding
country.
18John's disciples told him about all
these things. Calling two of them,
19he sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are
you the one who was to come, or should
we expect someone else?"
20When the men came to Jesus, they
said, "John the Baptist sent us to you to
ask, 'Are you the one who was to come,
or should we expect someone else?' "
21At that very time Jesus cured many
who had diseases, sicknesses and evil
spirits, and gave sight to many who
were blind.
22So he replied to the messengers, "Go
back and report to John what you have
seen and heard: The blind receive sight,
the lame walk, those who have leprosy
are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are
raised, and the good news is preached
to the poor.
23Blessed is the man who does not fall
away on account of me."
24After John's messengers left, Jesus
began to speak to the crowd about
John: "What did you go out into the
desert to see? A reed swayed by the
wind?
25If not, what did you go out to see? A
man dressed in fine clothes? No, those
who wear expensive clothes and indulge
in luxury are in palaces.
26But what did you go out to see? A
prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than
a prophet.
27This is the one about whom it is
written: " 'I will send my messenger
ahead of you, who will prepare your way
before you.'
28I tell you, among those born of women
there is no one greater than John; yet
the one who is least in the kingdom of
God is greater than he."
29(All the people, even the tax collectors,
when they heard Jesus' words,
acknowledged that God's way was right,
because they had been baptized by
John.
30But the Pharisees and experts in the
law rejected God's purpose for
themselves, because they had not been
baptized by John.)
31"To what, then, can I compare the
people of this generation? What are
they like?
32They are like children sitting in the
marketplace and calling out to each
other: " 'We played the flute for you, and
you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and
you did not cry.'
33For John the Baptist came neither
eating bread nor drinking wine, and you
say, 'He has a demon.'
34The Son of Man came eating and
drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton
and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors
and "sinners." '
35But wisdom is proved right by all her
children."
36Now one of the Pharisees invited
Jesus to have dinner with him, so he
went to the Pharisee's house and
reclined at the table.
37When a woman who had lived a sinful
life in that town learned that Jesus was
eating at the Pharisee's house, she
brought an alabaster jar of perfume,
38and as she stood behind him at his
feet weeping, she began to wet his feet
with her tears. Then she wiped them
with her hair, kissed them and poured
perfume on them.
39When the Pharisee who had invited
him saw this, he said to himself, "If this
man were a prophet, he would know
who is touching him and what kind of
woman she is--that she is a sinner."
40Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have
something to tell you." "Tell me,
teacher," he said.
41"Two men owed money to a certain
moneylender. One owed him five
hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
42Neither of them had the money to pay
him back, so he canceled the debts of
both. Now which of them will love him
more?"
43Simon replied, "I suppose the one who
had the bigger debt canceled." "You
have judged correctly," Jesus said.
44Then he turned toward the woman and
said to Simon, "Do you see this woman?
I came into your house. You did not give
me any water for my feet, but she wet
my feet with her tears and wiped them
with her hair.
45You did not give me a kiss, but this
woman, from the time I entered, has not
stopped kissing my feet.
46You did not put oil on my head, but
she has poured perfume on my feet.
47Therefore, I tell you, her many sins
have been forgiven--for she loved much.
But he who has been forgiven little loves
little."
48Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are
forgiven."
49The other guests began to say among
themselves, "Who is this who even
forgives sins?"
50Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith
has saved you; go in peace."
8After this, Jesus traveled about from
one town and village to another,
proclaiming the good news of the
kingdom of God. The Twelve were with
him,
2and also some women who had been
cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary
(called Magdalene) from whom seven
demons had come out;
3Joanna the wife of Cuza, the manager
of Herod's household; Susanna; and
many others. These women were
helping to support them out of their own
means.
4While a large crowd was gathering and
people were coming to Jesus from town
after town, he told this parable:
5"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As
he was scattering the seed, some fell
along the path; it was trampled on, and
the birds of the air ate it up.
6Some fell on rock, and when it came up,
the plants withered because they had no
moisture.
7Other seed fell among thorns, which
grew up with it and choked the plants.
8Still other seed fell on good soil. It
came up and yielded a crop, a hundred
times more than was sown." When he
said this, he called out, "He who has
ears to hear, let him hear."
9His disciples asked him what this
parable meant.
10He said, "The knowledge of the
secrets of the kingdom of God has been
given to you, but to others I speak in
parables, so that, " 'though seeing, they
may not see; though hearing, they may
not understand.'
11"This is the meaning of the parable:
The seed is the word of God.
12Those along the path are the ones
who hear, and then the devil comes and
takes away the word from their hearts,
so that they may not believe and be
saved.
13Those on the rock are the ones who
receive the word with joy when they
hear it, but they have no root. They
believe for a while, but in the time of
testing they fall away.
14The seed that fell among thorns
stands for those who hear, but as they
go on their way they are choked by life's
worries, riches and pleasures, and they
do not mature.
15But the seed on good soil stands for
those with a noble and good heart, who
hear the word, retain it, and by
persevering produce a crop.
16"No one lights a lamp and hides it in a
jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he
puts it on a stand, so that those who
come in can see the light.
17For there is nothing hidden that will not
be disclosed, and nothing concealed
that will not be known or brought out into
the open.
18Therefore consider carefully how you
listen. Whoever has will be given more;
whoever does not have, even what he
thinks he has will be taken from him."
19Now Jesus' mother and brothers came
to see him, but they were not able to get
near him because of the crowd.
20Someone told him, "Your mother and
brothers are standing outside, wanting
to see you."
21He replied, "My mother and brothers
are those who hear God's word and put
it into practice."
22One day Jesus said to his disciples,
"Let's go over to the other side of the
lake." So they got into a boat and set out.
23As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall
came down on the lake, so that the boat
was being swamped, and they were in
great danger.
24The disciples went and woke him,
saying, "Master, Master, we're going to
drown!"
25He got up and rebuked the wind and
the raging waters; the storm subsided,
and all was calm. "Where is your faith?"
he asked his disciples. In fear and
amazement they asked one another,
"Who is this? He commands even the
winds and the water, and they obey
him."
26They sailed to the region of the
Gerasenes, which is across the lake
from Galilee.
27When Jesus stepped ashore, he was
met by a demon-possessed man from
the town. For a long time this man had
not worn clothes or lived in a house, but
had lived in the tombs.
28When he saw Jesus, he cried out and
fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his
voice, "What do you want with me,
Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg
you, don't torture me!"
29For Jesus had commanded the evil
spirit to come out of the man. Many
times it had seized him, and though he
was chained hand and foot and kept
under guard, he had broken his chains
and had been driven by the demon into
solitary places.
30Jesus asked him, "What is your
name?"
31"Legion," he replied, because many
demons had gone into him. And they
begged him repeatedly not to order
them to go into the Abyss.
32A large herd of pigs was feeding there
on the hillside. The demons begged
Jesus to let them go into them, and he
gave them permission.
33When the demons came out of the
man, they went into the pigs, and the
herd rushed down the steep bank into
the lake and was drowned.
34When those tending the pigs saw what
had happened, they ran off and reported
this in the town and countryside,
35and the people went out to see what
had happened. When they came to
Jesus, they found the man from whom
the demons had gone out, sitting at
Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right
mind; and they were afraid.
36Those who had seen it told the people
how the demon-possessed man had
been cured.
37Then all the people of the region of the
Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them,
because they were overcome with fear.
So he got into the boat and left.
38The man from whom the demons had
gone out begged to go with him, but
Jesus sent him away, saying,
39"Return home and tell how much God
has done for you." So the man went
away and told all over town how much
Jesus had done for him.
40Now when Jesus returned, a crowd
welcomed him, for they were all
expecting him.
41Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of
the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus'
feet, pleading with him to come to his
house
42because his only daughter, a girl of
about twelve, was dying.
43As Jesus was on his way, the crowds
almost crushed him. And a woman was
there who had been subject to bleeding
for twelve years, but no one could heal
her.
44She came up behind him and touched
the edge of his cloak, and immediately
her bleeding stopped.
45"Who touched me?" Jesus asked.
When they all denied it, Peter said,
"Master, the people are crowding and
pressing against you."
46But Jesus said, "Someone touched
me; I know that power has gone out
from me."
47Then the woman, seeing that she
could not go unnoticed, came trembling
and fell at his feet. In the presence of all
the people, she told why she had
touched him and how she had been
instantly healed.
48Then he said to her, "Daughter, your
faith has healed you. Go in peace."
49While Jesus was still speaking,
someone came from the house of Jairus,
the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is
dead," he said. "Don't bother the teacher
any more."
50Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus,
"Don't be afraid; just believe, and she
will be healed."
51When he arrived at the house of Jairus,
he did not let anyone go in with him
except Peter, John and James, and the
child's father and mother.
52Meanwhile, all the people were wailing
and mourning for her. "Stop wailing,"
Jesus said. "She is not dead but
asleep."
53They laughed at him, knowing that she
was dead.
54But he took her by the hand and said,
"My child, get up!"
55Her spirit returned, and at once she
stood up. Then Jesus told them to give
her something to eat.
56Her parents were astonished, but he
ordered them not to tell anyone what
had happened.
9When Jesus had called the Twelve
together, he gave them power and
authority to drive out all demons and to
cure diseases,
2and he sent them out to preach the
kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
3He told them: "Take nothing for the
journey--no staff, no bag, no bread, no
money, no extra tunic.
4Whatever house you enter, stay there
until you leave that town.
5If people do not welcome you, shake
the dust off your feet when you leave
their town, as a testimony against them."
6So they set out and went from village to
village, preaching the gospel and
healing people everywhere.
7Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all
that was going on. And he was
perplexed, because some were saying
that John had been raised from the
dead,
8others that Elijah had appeared, and
still others that one of the prophets of
long ago had come back to life.
9But Herod said, "I beheaded John. Who,
then, is this I hear such things about?"
And he tried to see him.
10When the apostles returned, they
reported to Jesus what they had done.
Then he took them with him and they
withdrew by themselves to a town called
Bethsaida,
11but the crowds learned about it and
followed him. He welcomed them and
spoke to them about the kingdom of
God, and healed those who needed
healing.
12Late in the afternoon the Twelve came
to him and said, "Send the crowd away
so they can go to the surrounding
villages and countryside and find food
and lodging, because we are in a
remote place here."
13He replied, "You give them something
to eat."
14They answered, "We have only five
loaves of bread and two fish--unless we
go and buy food for all this crowd."
(About five thousand men were there.)
15But he said to his disciples, "Have
them sit down in groups of about fifty
each." The disciples did so, and
everybody sat down.
16Taking the five loaves and the two fish
and looking up to heaven, he gave
thanks and broke them. Then he gave
them to the disciples to set before the
people.
17They all ate and were satisfied, and
the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls
of broken pieces that were left over.
18Once when Jesus was praying in
private and his disciples were with him,
he asked them, "Who do the crowds say
I am?"
19They replied, "Some say John the
Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others,
that one of the prophets of long ago has
come back to life."
20"But what about you?" he asked. "Who
do you say I am?" Peter answered, "The
Christ of God."
21Jesus strictly warned them not to tell
this to anyone.
22And he said, "The Son of Man must
suffer many things and be rejected by
the elders, chief priests and teachers of
the law, and he must be killed and on
the third day be raised to life."
23Then he said to them all: "If anyone
would come after me, he must deny
himself and take up his cross daily and
follow me.
24For whoever wants to save his life will
lose it, but whoever loses his life for me
will save it.
25What good is it for a man to gain the
whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his
very self?
26If anyone is ashamed of me and my
words, the Son of Man will be ashamed
of him when he comes in his glory and
in the glory of the Father and of the holy
angels.
27I tell you the truth, some who are
standing here will not taste death before
they see the kingdom of God."
28About eight days after Jesus said this,
he took Peter, John and James with him
and went up onto a mountain to pray.
29As he was praying, the appearance of
his face changed, and his clothes
became as bright as a flash of lightning.
30Two men, Moses and Elijah,
31appeared in glorious splendor, talking
with Jesus. They spoke about his
departure, which he was about to bring
to fulfillment at Jerusalem.
32Peter and his companions were very
sleepy, but when they became fully
awake, they saw his glory and the two
men standing with him.
33As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter
said to him, "Master, it is good for us to
be here. Let us put up three shelters--
one for you, one for Moses and one for
Elijah." (He did not know what he was
saying.)
34While he was speaking, a cloud
appeared and enveloped them, and they
were afraid as they entered the cloud.
35A voice came from the cloud, saying,
"This is my Son, whom I have chosen;
listen to him."
36When the voice had spoken, they
found that Jesus was alone. The
disciples kept this to themselves, and
told no one at that time what they had
seen.
37The next day, when they came down
from the mountain, a large crowd met
him.
38A man in the crowd called out,
"Teacher, I beg you to look at my son,
for he is my only child.
39A spirit seizes him and he suddenly
screams; it throws him into convulsions
so that he foams at the mouth. It
scarcely ever leaves him and is
destroying him.
40I begged your disciples to drive it out,
but they could not."
41"O unbelieving and perverse
generation," Jesus replied, "how long
shall I stay with you and put up with
you? Bring your son here."
42Even while the boy was coming, the
demon threw him to the ground in a
convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the evil
spirit, healed the boy and gave him back
to his father.
43And they were all amazed at the
greatness of God.
44While everyone was marveling at all
that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,
"Listen carefully to what I am about to
tell you: The Son of Man is going to be
betrayed into the hands of men."
45But they did not understand what this
meant. It was hidden from them, so that
they did not grasp it, and they were
afraid to ask him about it.
46An argument started among the
disciples as to which of them would be
the greatest.
47Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a
little child and had him stand beside him.
48Then he said to them, "Whoever
welcomes this little child in my name
welcomes me; and whoever welcomes
me welcomes the one who sent me. For
he who is least among you all--he is the
greatest."
49"Master," said John, "we saw a man
driving out demons in your name and
we tried to stop him, because he is not
one of us."
50"Do not stop him," Jesus said, "for
whoever is not against you is for you."
51As the time approached for him to be
taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set
out for Jerusalem.
52And he sent messengers on ahead,
who went into a Samaritan village to get
things ready for him;
53but the people there did not welcome
him, because he was heading for
Jerusalem.
54When the disciples James and John
saw this, they asked, "Lord, do you want
us to call fire down from heaven to
destroy them ?"
55But Jesus turned and rebuked them,
56and they went to another village.
57As they were walking along the road, a
man said to him, "I will follow you
wherever you go."
58Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes and
birds of the air have nests, but the Son
of Man has no place to lay his head."
59He said to another man, "Follow me."
But the man replied, "Lord, first let me
go and bury my father."
60Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury
their own dead, but you go and proclaim
the kingdom of God."
61Still another said, "I will follow you,
Lord; but first let me go back and say
good-by to my family."
62Jesus replied, "No one who puts his
hand to the plow and looks back is fit for
service in the kingdom of God."
10After this the Lord appointed
seventy-two others and sent them two
by two ahead of him to every town and
place where he was about to go.
2He told them, "The harvest is plentiful,
but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of
the harvest, therefore, to send out
workers into his harvest field.
3Go! I am sending you out like lambs
among wolves.
4Do not take a purse or bag or sandals;
and do not greet anyone on the road.
5"When you enter a house, first say,
'Peace to this house.'
6If a man of peace is there, your peace
will rest on him; if not, it will return to you.
7Stay in that house, eating and drinking
whatever they give you, for the worker
deserves his wages. Do not move
around from house to house.
8"When you enter a town and are
welcomed, eat what is set before you.
9Heal the sick who are there and tell
them, 'The kingdom of God is near you.'
10But when you enter a town and are not
welcomed, go into its streets and say,
11'Even the dust of your town that sticks
to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet
be sure of this: The kingdom of God is
near.'
12I tell you, it will be more bearable on
that day for Sodom than for that town.
13"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you,
Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were
performed in you had been performed in
Tyre and Sidon, they would have
repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth
and ashes.
14But it will be more bearable for Tyre
and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
15And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted
up to the skies? No, you will go down to
the depths.
16"He who listens to you listens to me;
he who rejects you rejects me; but he
who rejects me rejects him who sent
me."
17The seventy-two returned with joy and
said, "Lord, even the demons submit to
us in your name."
18He replied, "I saw Satan fall like
lightning from heaven.
19I have given you authority to trample
on snakes and scorpions and to
overcome all the power of the enemy;
nothing will harm you.
20However, do not rejoice that the spirits
submit to you, but rejoice that your
names are written in heaven."
21At that time Jesus, full of joy through
the Holy Spirit, said, "I praise you,
Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
because you have hidden these things
from the wise and learned, and revealed
them to little children. Yes, Father, for
this was your good pleasure.
22"All things have been committed to me
by my Father. No one knows who the
Son is except the Father, and no one
knows who the Father is except the Son
and those to whom the Son chooses to
reveal him."
23Then he turned to his disciples and
said privately, "Blessed are the eyes
that see what you see.
24For I tell you that many prophets and
kings wanted to see what you see but
did not see it, and to hear what you hear
but did not hear it."
25On one occasion an expert in the law
stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he
asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal
life?"
26"What is written in the Law?" he
replied. "How do you read it?"
27He answered: " 'Love the Lord your
God with all your heart and with all your
soul and with all your strength and with
all your mind' ; and, 'Love your neighbor
as yourself.' "
28"You have answered correctly," Jesus
replied. "Do this and you will live."
29But he wanted to justify himself, so he
asked Jesus, "And who is my
neighbor?"
30In reply Jesus said: "A man was going
down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when
he fell into the hands of robbers. They
stripped him of his clothes, beat him and
went away, leaving him half dead.
31A priest happened to be going down
the same road, and when he saw the
man, he passed by on the other side.
32So too, a Levite, when he came to the
place and saw him, passed by on the
other side.
33But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came
where the man was; and when he saw
him, he took pity on him.
34He went to him and bandaged his
wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then
he put the man on his own donkey, took
him to an inn and took care of him.
35The next day he took out two silver
coins and gave them to the innkeeper.
'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I
return, I will reimburse you for any extra
expense you may have.'
36"Which of these three do you think was
a neighbor to the man who fell into the
hands of robbers?"
37The expert in the law replied, "The one
who had mercy on him." Jesus told him,
"Go and do likewise."
38As Jesus and his disciples were on
their way, he came to a village where a
woman named Martha opened her
home to him.
39She had a sister called Mary, who sat
at the Lord's feet listening to what he
said.
40But Martha was distracted by all the
preparations that had to be made. She
came to him and asked, "Lord, don't you
care that my sister has left me to do the
work by myself? Tell her to help me!"
41"Martha, Martha," the Lord answered,
"you are worried and upset about many
things,
42but only one thing is needed. Mary has
chosen what is better, and it will not be
taken away from her."
11One day Jesus was praying in a
certain place. When he finished, one of
his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us
to pray, just as John taught his
disciples."
2He said to them, "When you pray, say:
" 'Father, hallowed be your name, your
kingdom come.
3Give us each day our daily bread.
4Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive
everyone who sins against us. And lead
us not into temptation. ' "
5Then he said to them, "Suppose one of
you has a friend, and he goes to him at
midnight and says, 'Friend, lend me
three loaves of bread,
6because a friend of mine on a journey
has come to me, and I have nothing to
set before him.'
7"Then the one inside answers, 'Don't
bother me. The door is already locked,
and my children are with me in bed. I
can't get up and give you anything.'
8I tell you, though he will not get up and
give him the bread because he is his
friend, yet because of the man's
boldness he will get up and give him as
much as he needs.
9"So I say to you: Ask and it will be
given to you; seek and you will find;
knock and the door will be opened to
you.
10For everyone who asks receives; he
who seeks finds; and to him who knocks,
the door will be opened.
11"Which of you fathers, if your son asks
for a fish, will give him a snake instead?
12Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a
scorpion?
13If you then, though you are evil, know
how to give good gifts to your children,
how much more will your Father in
heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who
ask him!"
14Jesus was driving out a demon that
was mute. When the demon left, the
man who had been mute spoke, and the
crowd was amazed.
15But some of them said, "By Beelzebub,
the prince of demons, he is driving out
demons."
16Others tested him by asking for a sign
from heaven.
17Jesus knew their thoughts and said to
them: "Any kingdom divided against
itself will be ruined, and a house divided
against itself will fall.
18If Satan is divided against himself, how
can his kingdom stand? I say this
because you claim that I drive out
demons by Beelzebub.
19Now if I drive out demons by
Beelzebub, by whom do your followers
drive them out? So then, they will be
your judges.
20But if I drive out demons by the finger
of God, then the kingdom of God has
come to you.
21"When a strong man, fully armed,
guards his own house, his possessions
are safe.
22But when someone stronger attacks
and overpowers him, he takes away the
armor in which the man trusted and
divides up the spoils.
23"He who is not with me is against me,
and he who does not gather with me,
scatters.
24"When an evil spirit comes out of a
man, it goes through arid places seeking
rest and does not find it. Then it says, 'I
will return to the house I left.'
25When it arrives, it finds the house
swept clean and put in order.
26Then it goes and takes seven other
spirits more wicked than itself, and they
go in and live there. And the final
condition of that man is worse than the
first."
27As Jesus was saying these things, a
woman in the crowd called out, "Blessed
is the mother who gave you birth and
nursed you."
28He replied, "Blessed rather are those
who hear the word of God and obey it."
29As the crowds increased, Jesus said,
"This is a wicked generation. It asks for
a miraculous sign, but none will be given
it except the sign of Jonah.
30For as Jonah was a sign to the
Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be
to this generation.
31The Queen of the South will rise at the
judgment with the men of this
generation and condemn them; for she
came from the ends of the earth to listen
to Solomon's wisdom, and now one
greater than Solomon is here.
32The men of Nineveh will stand up at
the judgment with this generation and
condemn it; for they repented at the
preaching of Jonah, and now one
greater than Jonah is here.
33"No one lights a lamp and puts it in a
place where it will be hidden, or under a
bowl. Instead he puts it on its stand, so
that those who come in may see the
light.
34Your eye is the lamp of your body.
When your eyes are good, your whole
body also is full of light. But when they
are bad, your body also is full of
darkness.
35See to it, then, that the light within you
is not darkness.
36Therefore, if your whole body is full of
light, and no part of it dark, it will be
completely lighted, as when the light of
a lamp shines on you."
37When Jesus had finished speaking, a
Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so
he went in and reclined at the table.
38But the Pharisee, noticing that Jesus
did not first wash before the meal, was
surprised.
39Then the Lord said to him, "Now then,
you Pharisees clean the outside of the
cup and dish, but inside you are full of
greed and wickedness.
40You foolish people! Did not the one
who made the outside make the inside
also?
41But give what is inside the dish to the
poor, and everything will be clean for
you.
42"Woe to you Pharisees, because you
give God a tenth of your mint, rue and
all other kinds of garden herbs, but you
neglect justice and the love of God. You
should have practiced the latter without
leaving the former undone.
43"Woe to you Pharisees, because you
love the most important seats in the
synagogues and greetings in the
marketplaces.
44"Woe to you, because you are like
unmarked graves, which men walk over
without knowing it."
45One of the experts in the law
answered him, "Teacher, when you say
these things, you insult us also."
46Jesus replied, "And you experts in the
law, woe to you, because you load
people down with burdens they can
hardly carry, and you yourselves will not
lift one finger to help them.
47"Woe to you, because you build tombs
for the prophets, and it was your
forefathers who killed them.
48So you testify that you approve of what
your forefathers did; they killed the
prophets, and you build their tombs.
49Because of this, God in his wisdom
said, 'I will send them prophets and
apostles, some of whom they will kill
and others they will persecute.'
50Therefore this generation will be held
responsible for the blood of all the
prophets that has been shed since the
beginning of the world,
51from the blood of Abel to the blood of
Zechariah, who was killed between the
altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you,
this generation will be held responsible
for it all.
52"Woe to you experts in the law,
because you have taken away the key
to knowledge. You yourselves have not
entered, and you have hindered those
who were entering."
53When Jesus left there, the Pharisees
and the teachers of the law began to
oppose him fiercely and to besiege him
with questions,
54waiting to catch him in something he
might say.
12Meanwhile, when a crowd of
many thousands had gathered, so that
they were trampling on one another,
Jesus began to speak first to his
disciples, saying: "Be on your guard
against the yeast of the Pharisees,
which is hypocrisy.
2There is nothing concealed that will not
be disclosed, or hidden that will not be
made known.
3What you have said in the dark will be
heard in the daylight, and what you have
whispered in the ear in the inner rooms
will be proclaimed from the roofs.
4"I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid
of those who kill the body and after that
can do no more.
5But I will show you whom you should
fear: Fear him who, after the killing of
the body, has power to throw you into
hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him.
6Are not five sparrows sold for two
pennies ? Yet not one of them is
forgotten by God.
7Indeed, the very hairs of your head are
all numbered. Don't be afraid; you are
worth more than many sparrows.
8"I tell you, whoever acknowledges me
before men, the Son of Man will also
acknowledge him before the angels of
God.
9But he who disowns me before men will
be disowned before the angels of God.
10And everyone who speaks a word
against the Son of Man will be forgiven,
but anyone who blasphemes against the
Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
11"When you are brought before
synagogues, rulers and authorities, do
not worry about how you will defend
yourselves or what you will say,
12for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that
time what you should say."
13Someone in the crowd said to him,
"Teacher, tell my brother to divide the
inheritance with me."
14Jesus replied, "Man, who appointed
me a judge or an arbiter between you?"
15Then he said to them, "Watch out! Be
on your guard against all kinds of greed;
a man's life does not consist in the
abundance of his possessions."
16And he told them this parable: "The
ground of a certain rich man produced a
good crop.
17He thought to himself, 'What shall I
do? I have no place to store my crops.'
18"Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will
tear down my barns and build bigger
ones, and there I will store all my grain
and my goods.
19And I'll say to myself, "You have plenty
of good things laid up for many years.
Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry."
'
20"But God said to him, 'You fool! This
very night your life will be demanded
from you. Then who will get what you
have prepared for yourself?'
21"This is how it will be with anyone who
stores up things for himself but is not
rich toward God."
22Then Jesus said to his disciples:
"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about
your life, what you will eat; or about your
body, what you will wear.
23Life is more than food, and the body
more than clothes.
24Consider the ravens: They do not sow
or reap, they have no storeroom or barn;
yet God feeds them. And how much
more valuable you are than birds!
25Who of you by worrying can add a
single hour to his life ?
26Since you cannot do this very little
thing, why do you worry about the rest?
27"Consider how the lilies grow. They do
not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even
Solomon in all his splendor was dressed
like one of these.
28If that is how God clothes the grass of
the field, which is here today, and
tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how
much more will he clothe you, O you of
little faith!
29And do not set your heart on what you
will eat or drink; do not worry about it.
30For the pagan world runs after all such
things, and your Father knows that you
need them.
31But seek his kingdom, and these
things will be given to you as well.
32"Do not be afraid, little flock, for your
Father has been pleased to give you the
kingdom.
33Sell your possessions and give to the
poor. Provide purses for yourselves that
will not wear out, a treasure in heaven
that will not be exhausted, where no
thief comes near and no moth destroys.
34For where your treasure is, there your
heart will be also.
35"Be dressed ready for service and
keep your lamps burning,
36like men waiting for their master to
return from a wedding banquet, so that
when he comes and knocks they can
immediately open the door for him.
37It will be good for those servants
whose master finds them watching
when he comes. I tell you the truth, he
will dress himself to serve, will have
them recline at the table and will come
and wait on them.
38It will be good for those servants
whose master finds them ready, even if
he comes in the second or third watch of
the night.
39But understand this: If the owner of the
house had known at what hour the thief
was coming, he would not have let his
house be broken into.
40You also must be ready, because the
Son of Man will come at an hour when
you do not expect him."
41Peter asked, "Lord, are you telling this
parable to us, or to everyone?"
42The Lord answered, "Who then is the
faithful and wise manager, whom the
master puts in charge of his servants to
give them their food allowance at the
proper time?
43It will be good for that servant whom
the master finds doing so when he
returns.
44I tell you the truth, he will put him in
charge of all his possessions.
45But suppose the servant says to
himself, 'My master is taking a long time
in coming,' and he then begins to beat
the menservants and maidservants and
to eat and drink and get drunk.
46The master of that servant will come
on a day when he does not expect him
and at an hour he is not aware of. He
will cut him to pieces and assign him a
place with the unbelievers.
47"That servant who knows his master's
will and does not get ready or does not
do what his master wants will be beaten
with many blows.
48But the one who does not know and
does things deserving punishment will
be beaten with few blows. From
everyone who has been given much,
much will be demanded; and from the
one who has been entrusted with much,
much more will be asked.
49"I have come to bring fire on the earth,
and how I wish it were already kindled!
50But I have a baptism to undergo, and
how distressed I am until it is completed!
51Do you think I came to bring peace on
earth? No, I tell you, but division.
52From now on there will be five in one
family divided against each other, three
against two and two against three.
53They will be divided, father against son
and son against father, mother against
daughter and daughter against mother,
mother-in-law against daughter-in-law
and daughter-in-law against mother-inlaw."
54He said to the crowd: "When you see a
cloud rising in the west, immediately you
say, 'It's going to rain,' and it does.
55And when the south wind blows, you
say, 'It's going to be hot,' and it is.
56Hypocrites! You know how to interpret
the appearance of the earth and the sky.
How is it that you don't know how to
interpret this present time?
57"Why don't you judge for yourselves
what is right?
58As you are going with your adversary
to the magistrate, try hard to be
reconciled to him on the way, or he may
drag you off to the judge, and the judge
turn you over to the officer, and the
officer throw you into prison.
59I tell you, you will not get out until you
have paid the last penny. "
13Now there were some present at
that time who told Jesus about the
Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed
with their sacrifices.
2Jesus answered, "Do you think that
these Galileans were worse sinners
than all the other Galileans because
they suffered this way?
3I tell you, no! But unless you repent,
you too will all perish.
4Or those eighteen who died when the
tower in Siloam fell on them--do you
think they were more guilty than all the
others living in Jerusalem?
5I tell you, no! But unless you repent,
you too will all perish."
6Then he told this parable: "A man had a
fig tree, planted in his vineyard, and he
went to look for fruit on it, but did not
find any.
7So he said to the man who took care of
the vineyard, 'For three years now I've
been coming to look for fruit on this fig
tree and haven't found any. Cut it down!
Why should it use up the soil?'
8" 'Sir,' the man replied, 'leave it alone
for one more year, and I'll dig around it
and fertilize it.
9If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not,
then cut it down.' "
10On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in
one of the synagogues,
11and a woman was there who had been
crippled by a spirit for eighteen years.
She was bent over and could not
straighten up at all.
12When Jesus saw her, he called her
forward and said to her, "Woman, you
are set free from your infirmity."
13Then he put his hands on her, and
immediately she straightened up and
praised God.
14Indignant because Jesus had healed
on the Sabbath, the synagogue ruler
said to the people, "There are six days
for work. So come and be healed on
those days, not on the Sabbath."
15The Lord answered him, "You
hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the
Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the
stall and lead it out to give it water?
16Then should not this woman, a
daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has
kept bound for eighteen long years, be
set free on the Sabbath day from what
bound her?"
17When he said this, all his opponents
were humiliated, but the people were
delighted with all the wonderful things
he was doing.
18Then Jesus asked, "What is the
kingdom of God like? What shall I
compare it to?
19It is like a mustard seed, which a man
took and planted in his garden. It grew
and became a tree, and the birds of the
air perched in its branches."
20Again he asked, "What shall I compare
the kingdom of God to?
21It is like yeast that a woman took and
mixed into a large amount of flour until it
worked all through the dough."
22Then Jesus went through the towns
and villages, teaching as he made his
way to Jerusalem.
23Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a
few people going to be saved?"
24He said to them, "Make every effort to
enter through the narrow door, because
many, I tell you, will try to enter and will
not be able to.
25Once the owner of the house gets up
and closes the door, you will stand
outside knocking and pleading, 'Sir,
open the door for us.' "But he will
answer, 'I don't know you or where you
come from.'
26"Then you will say, 'We ate and drank
with you, and you taught in our streets.'
27"But he will reply, 'I don't know you or
where you come from. Away from me,
all you evildoers!'
28"There will be weeping there, and
gnashing of teeth, when you see
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the
prophets in the kingdom of God, but you
yourselves thrown out.
29People will come from east and west
and north and south, and will take their
places at the feast in the kingdom of
God.
30Indeed there are those who are last
who will be first, and first who will be
last."
31At that time some Pharisees came to
Jesus and said to him, "Leave this place
and go somewhere else. Herod wants to
kill you."
32He replied, "Go tell that fox, 'I will drive
out demons and heal people today and
tomorrow, and on the third day I will
reach my goal.'
33In any case, I must keep going today
and tomorrow and the next day--for
surely no prophet can die outside
Jerusalem!
34"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill
the prophets and stone those sent to
you, how often I have longed to gather
your children together, as a hen gathers
her chicks under her wings, but you
were not willing!
35Look, your house is left to you
desolate. I tell you, you will not see me
again until you say, 'Blessed is he who
comes in the name of the Lord.' "
14One Sabbath, when Jesus went to
eat in the house of a prominent
Pharisee, he was being carefully
watched.
2There in front of him was a man
suffering from dropsy.
3Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts
in the law, "Is it lawful to heal on the
Sabbath or not?"
4But they remained silent. So taking hold
of the man, he healed him and sent him
away.
5Then he asked them, "If one of you has
a son or an ox that falls into a well on
the Sabbath day, will you not
immediately pull him out?"
6And they had nothing to say.
7When he noticed how the guests
picked the places of honor at the table,
he told them this parable:
8"When someone invites you to a
wedding feast, do not take the place of
honor, for a person more distinguished
than you may have been invited.
9If so, the host who invited both of you
will come and say to you, 'Give this man
your seat.' Then, humiliated, you will
have to take the least important place.
10But when you are invited, take the
lowest place, so that when your host
comes, he will say to you, 'Friend, move
up to a better place.' Then you will be
honored in the presence of all your
fellow guests.
11For everyone who exalts himself will
be humbled, and he who humbles
himself will be exalted."
12Then Jesus said to his host, "When
you give a luncheon or dinner, do not
invite your friends, your brothers or
relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you
do, they may invite you back and so you
will be repaid.
13But when you give a banquet, invite
the poor, the crippled, the lame, the
blind,
14and you will be blessed. Although they
cannot repay you, you will be repaid at
the resurrection of the righteous."
15When one of those at the table with
him heard this, he said to Jesus,
"Blessed is the man who will eat at the
feast in the kingdom of God."
16Jesus replied: "A certain man was
preparing a great banquet and invited
many guests.
17At the time of the banquet he sent his
servant to tell those who had been
invited, 'Come, for everything is now
ready.'
18"But they all alike began to make
excuses. The first said, 'I have just
bought a field, and I must go and see it.
Please excuse me.'
19"Another said, 'I have just bought five
yoke of oxen, and I'm on my way to try
them out. Please excuse me.'
20"Still another said, 'I just got married,
so I can't come.'
21"The servant came back and reported
this to his master. Then the owner of the
house became angry and ordered his
servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets
and alleys of the town and bring in the
poor, the crippled, the blind and the
lame.'
22" 'Sir,' the servant said, 'what you
ordered has been done, but there is still
room.'
23"Then the master told his servant, 'Go
out to the roads and country lanes and
make them come in, so that my house
will be full.
24I tell you, not one of those men who
were invited will get a taste of my
banquet.' "
25Large crowds were traveling with
Jesus, and turning to them he said:
26"If anyone comes to me and does not
hate his father and mother, his wife and
children, his brothers and sisters--yes,
even his own life--he cannot be my
disciple.
27And anyone who does not carry his
cross and follow me cannot be my
disciple.
28"Suppose one of you wants to build a
tower. Will he not first sit down and
estimate the cost to see if he has
enough money to complete it?
29For if he lays the foundation and is not
able to finish it, everyone who sees it
will ridicule him,
30saying, 'This fellow began to build and
was not able to finish.'
31"Or suppose a king is about to go to
war against another king. Will he not
first sit down and consider whether he is
able with ten thousand men to oppose
the one coming against him with twenty
thousand?
32If he is not able, he will send a
delegation while the other is still a long
way off and will ask for terms of peace.
33In the same way, any of you who does
not give up everything he has cannot be
my disciple.
34"Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness,
how can it be made salty again?
35It is fit neither for the soil nor for the
manure pile; it is thrown out. "He who
has ears to hear, let him hear."
15Now the tax collectors and
"sinners" were all gathering around to
hear him.
2But the Pharisees and the teachers of
the law muttered, "This man welcomes
sinners and eats with them."
3Then Jesus told them this parable:
4"Suppose one of you has a hundred
sheep and loses one of them. Does he
not leave the ninety-nine in the open
country and go after the lost sheep until
he finds it?
5And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it
on his shoulders
6and goes home. Then he calls his
friends and neighbors together and says,
'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost
sheep.'
7I tell you that in the same way there will
be more rejoicing in heaven over one
sinner who repents than over ninetynine
righteous persons who do not need
to repent.
8"Or suppose a woman has ten silver
coins and loses one. Does she not light
a lamp, sweep the house and search
carefully until she finds it?
9And when she finds it, she calls her
friends and neighbors together and says,
'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost
coin.'
10In the same way, I tell you, there is
rejoicing in the presence of the angels of
God over one sinner who repents."
11Jesus continued: "There was a man
who had two sons.
12The younger one said to his father,
'Father, give me my share of the estate.'
So he divided his property between
them.
13"Not long after that, the younger son
got together all he had, set off for a
distant country and there squandered
his wealth in wild living.
14After he had spent everything, there
was a severe famine in that whole
country, and he began to be in need.
15So he went and hired himself out to a
citizen of that country, who sent him to
his fields to feed pigs.
16He longed to fill his stomach with the
pods that the pigs were eating, but no
one gave him anything.
17"When he came to his senses, he said,
'How many of my father's hired men
have food to spare, and here I am
starving to death!
18I will set out and go back to my father
and say to him: Father, I have sinned
against heaven and against you.
19I am no longer worthy to be called your
son; make me like one of your hired
men.'
20So he got up and went to his father.
"But while he was still a long way off, his
father saw him and was filled with
compassion for him; he ran to his son,
threw his arms around him and kissed
him.
21"The son said to him, 'Father, I have
sinned against heaven and against you.
I am no longer worthy to be called your
son. '
22"But the father said to his servants,
'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on
him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals
on his feet.
23Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's
have a feast and celebrate.
24For this son of mine was dead and is
alive again; he was lost and is found.'
So they began to celebrate.
25"Meanwhile, the older son was in the
field. When he came near the house, he
heard music and dancing.
26So he called one of the servants and
asked him what was going on.
27'Your brother has come,' he replied,
'and your father has killed the fattened
calf because he has him back safe and
sound.'
28"The older brother became angry and
refused to go in. So his father went out
and pleaded with him.
29But he answered his father, 'Look! All
these years I've been slaving for you
and never disobeyed your orders. Yet
you never gave me even a young goat
so I could celebrate with my friends.
30But when this son of yours who has
squandered your property with
prostitutes comes home, you kill the
fattened calf for him!'
31" 'My son,' the father said, 'you are
always with me, and everything I have is
yours.
32But we had to celebrate and be glad,
because this brother of yours was dead
and is alive again; he was lost and is
found.' "
16Jesus told his disciples: "There
was a rich man whose manager was
accused of wasting his possessions.
2So he called him in and asked him,
'What is this I hear about you? Give an
account of your management, because
you cannot be manager any longer.'
3"The manager said to himself, 'What
shall I do now? My master is taking
away my job. I'm not strong enough to
dig, and I'm ashamed to beg--
4I know what I'll do so that, when I lose
my job here, people will welcome me
into their houses.'
5"So he called in each one of his
master's debtors. He asked the first,
'How much do you owe my master?'
6" 'Eight hundred gallons of olive oil,' he
replied. "The manager told him, 'Take
your bill, sit down quickly, and make it
four hundred.'
7"Then he asked the second, 'And how
much do you owe?' " 'A thousand
bushels of wheat,' he replied. "He told
him, 'Take your bill and make it eight
hundred.'
8"The master commended the dishonest
manager because he had acted
shrewdly. For the people of this world
are more shrewd in dealing with their
own kind than are the people of the light.
9I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain
friends for yourselves, so that when it is
gone, you will be welcomed into eternal
dwellings.
10"Whoever can be trusted with very little
can also be trusted with much, and
whoever is dishonest with very little will
also be dishonest with much.
11So if you have not been trustworthy in
handling worldly wealth, who will trust
you with true riches?
12And if you have not been trustworthy
with someone else's property, who will
give you property of your own?
13"No servant can serve two masters.
Either he will hate the one and love the
other, or he will be devoted to the one
and despise the other. You cannot serve
both God and Money."
14The Pharisees, who loved money,
heard all this and were sneering at
Jesus.
15He said to them, "You are the ones
who justify yourselves in the eyes of
men, but God knows your hearts. What
is highly valued among men is
detestable in God's sight.
16"The Law and the Prophets were
proclaimed until John. Since that time,
the good news of the kingdom of God is
being preached, and everyone is forcing
his way into it.
17It is easier for heaven and earth to
disappear than for the least stroke of a
pen to drop out of the Law.
18"Anyone who divorces his wife and
marries another woman commits
adultery, and the man who marries a
divorced woman commits adultery.
19"There was a rich man who was
dressed in purple and fine linen and
lived in luxury every day.
20At his gate was laid a beggar named
Lazarus, covered with sores
21and longing to eat what fell from the
rich man's table. Even the dogs came
and licked his sores.
22"The time came when the beggar died
and the angels carried him to Abraham's
side. The rich man also died and was
buried.
23In hell, where he was in torment, he
looked up and saw Abraham far away,
with Lazarus by his side.
24So he called to him, 'Father Abraham,
have pity on me and send Lazarus to
dip the tip of his finger in water and cool
my tongue, because I am in agony in
this fire.'
25"But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember
that in your lifetime you received your
good things, while Lazarus received bad
things, but now he is comforted here
and you are in agony.
26And besides all this, between us and
you a great chasm has been fixed, so
that those who want to go from here to
you cannot, nor can anyone cross over
from there to us.'
27"He answered, 'Then I beg you, father,
send Lazarus to my father's house,
28for I have five brothers. Let him warn
them, so that they will not also come to
this place of torment.'
29"Abraham replied, 'They have Moses
and the Prophets; let them listen to
them.'
30" 'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if
someone from the dead goes to them,
they will repent.'
31"He said to him, 'If they do not listen to
Moses and the Prophets, they will not
be convinced even if someone rises
from the dead.' "
17Jesus said to his disciples:
"Things that cause people to sin are
bound to come, but woe to that person
through whom they come.
2It would be better for him to be thrown
into the sea with a millstone tied around
his neck than for him to cause one of
these little ones to sin.
3So watch yourselves. "If your brother
sins, rebuke him, and if he repents,
forgive him.
4If he sins against you seven times in a
day, and seven times comes back to
you and says, 'I repent,' forgive him."
5The apostles said to the Lord,
"Increase our faith!"
6He replied, "If you have faith as small
as a mustard seed, you can say to this
mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted
in the sea,' and it will obey you.
7"Suppose one of you had a servant
plowing or looking after the sheep.
Would he say to the servant when he
comes in from the field, 'Come along
now and sit down to eat'?
8Would he not rather say, 'Prepare my
supper, get yourself ready and wait on
me while I eat and drink; after that you
may eat and drink'?
9Would he thank the servant because he
did what he was told to do?
10So you also, when you have done
everything you were told to do, should
say, 'We are unworthy servants; we
have only done our duty.' "
11Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus
traveled along the border between
Samaria and Galilee.
12As he was going into a village, ten
men who had leprosy met him. They
stood at a distance
13and called out in a loud voice, "Jesus,
Master, have pity on us!"
14When he saw them, he said, "Go,
show yourselves to the priests." And as
they went, they were cleansed.
15One of them, when he saw he was
healed, came back, praising God in a
loud voice.
16He threw himself at Jesus' feet and
thanked him--and he was a Samaritan.
17Jesus asked, "Were not all ten
cleansed? Where are the other nine?
18Was no one found to return and give
praise to God except this foreigner?"
19Then he said to him, "Rise and go;
your faith has made you well."
20Once, having been asked by the
Pharisees when the kingdom of God
would come, Jesus replied, "The
kingdom of God does not come with
your careful observation,
21nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or
'There it is,' because the kingdom of
God is within you."
22Then he said to his disciples, "The
time is coming when you will long to see
one of the days of the Son of Man, but
you will not see it.
23Men will tell you, 'There he is!' or 'Here
he is!' Do not go running off after them.
24For the Son of Man in his day will be
like the lightning, which flashes and
lights up the sky from one end to the
other.
25But first he must suffer many things
and be rejected by this generation.
26"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so
also will it be in the days of the Son of
Man.
27People were eating, drinking, marrying
and being given in marriage up to the
day Noah entered the ark. Then the
flood came and destroyed them all.
28"It was the same in the days of Lot.
People were eating and drinking, buying
and selling, planting and building.
29But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and
sulfur rained down from heaven and
destroyed them all.
30"It will be just like this on the day the
Son of Man is revealed.
31On that day no one who is on the roof
of his house, with his goods inside,
should go down to get them. Likewise,
no one in the field should go back for
anything.
32Remember Lot's wife!
33Whoever tries to keep his life will lose
it, and whoever loses his life will
preserve it.
34I tell you, on that night two people will
be in one bed; one will be taken and the
other left.
35Two women will be grinding grain
together; one will be taken and the other
left."
37"Where, Lord?" they asked. He replied,
"Where there is a dead body, there the
vultures will gather."
18Then Jesus told his disciples a
parable to show them that they should
always pray and not give up.
2He said: "In a certain town there was a
judge who neither feared God nor cared
about men.
3And there was a widow in that town
who kept coming to him with the plea,
'Grant me justice against my adversary.'
4"For some time he refused. But finally
he said to himself, 'Even though I don't
fear God or care about men,
5yet because this widow keeps
bothering me, I will see that she gets
justice, so that she won't eventually
wear me out with her coming!' "
6And the Lord said, "Listen to what the
unjust judge says.
7And will not God bring about justice for
his chosen ones, who cry out to him day
and night? Will he keep putting them
off?
8I tell you, he will see that they get
justice, and quickly. However, when the
Son of Man comes, will he find faith on
the earth?"
9To some who were confident of their
own righteousness and looked down on
everybody else, Jesus told this parable:
10"Two men went up to the temple to
pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax
collector.
11The Pharisee stood up and prayed
about himself: 'God, I thank you that I
am not like other men--robbers,
evildoers, adulterers--or even like this
tax collector.
12I fast twice a week and give a tenth of
all I get.'
13"But the tax collector stood at a
distance. He would not even look up to
heaven, but beat his breast and said,
'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'
14"I tell you that this man, rather than the
other, went home justified before God.
For everyone who exalts himself will be
humbled, and he who humbles himself
will be exalted."
15People were also bringing babies to
Jesus to have him touch them. When
the disciples saw this, they rebuked
them.
16But Jesus called the children to him
and said, "Let the little children come to
me, and do not hinder them, for the
kingdom of God belongs to such as
these.
17I tell you the truth, anyone who will not
receive the kingdom of God like a little
child will never enter it."
18A certain ruler asked him, "Good
teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal
life?"
19"Why do you call me good?" Jesus
answered. "No one is good--except God
alone.
20You know the commandments: 'Do not
commit adultery, do not murder, do not
steal, do not give false testimony, honor
your father and mother.' "
21"All these I have kept since I was a
boy," he said.
22When Jesus heard this, he said to him,
"You still lack one thing. Sell everything
you have and give to the poor, and you
will have treasure in heaven. Then come,
follow me."
23When he heard this, he became very
sad, because he was a man of great
wealth.
24Jesus looked at him and said, "How
hard it is for the rich to enter the
kingdom of God!
25Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle than for a
rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
26Those who heard this asked, "Who
then can be saved?"
27Jesus replied, "What is impossible with
men is possible with God."
28Peter said to him, "We have left all we
had to follow you!"
29"I tell you the truth," Jesus said to them,
"no one who has left home or wife or
brothers or parents or children for the
sake of the kingdom of God
30will fail to receive many times as much
in this age and, in the age to come,
eternal life."
31Jesus took the Twelve aside and told
them, "We are going up to Jerusalem,
and everything that is written by the
prophets about the Son of Man will be
fulfilled.
32He will be handed over to the Gentiles.
They will mock him, insult him, spit on
him, flog him and kill him.
33On the third day he will rise again."
34The disciples did not understand any
of this. Its meaning was hidden from
them, and they did not know what he
was talking about.
35As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind
man was sitting by the roadside begging.
36When he heard the crowd going by, he
asked what was happening.
37They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is
passing by."
38He called out, "Jesus, Son of David,
have mercy on me!"
39Those who led the way rebuked him
and told him to be quiet, but he shouted
all the more, "Son of David, have mercy
on me!"
40Jesus stopped and ordered the man to
be brought to him. When he came near,
Jesus asked him,
41"What do you want me to do for you?"
"Lord, I want to see," he replied.
42Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight;
your faith has healed you."
43Immediately he received his sight and
followed Jesus, praising God. When all
the people saw it, they also praised God.
19Jesus entered Jericho and was
passing through.
2A man was there by the name of
Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector
and was wealthy.
3He wanted to see who Jesus was, but
being a short man he could not,
because of the crowd.
4So he ran ahead and climbed a
sycamore-fig tree to see him, since
Jesus was coming that way.
5When Jesus reached the spot, he
looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus,
come down immediately. I must stay at
your house today."
6So he came down at once and
welcomed him gladly.
7All the people saw this and began to
mutter, "He has gone to be the guest of
a 'sinner.' "
8But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the
Lord, "Look, Lord! Here and now I give
half of my possessions to the poor, and
if I have cheated anybody out of
anything, I will pay back four times the
amount."
9Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has
come to this house, because this man,
too, is a son of Abraham.
10For the Son of Man came to seek and
to save what was lost."
11While they were listening to this, he
went on to tell them a parable, because
he was near Jerusalem and the people
thought that the kingdom of God was
going to appear at once.
12He said: "A man of noble birth went to
a distant country to have himself
appointed king and then to return.
13So he called ten of his servants and
gave them ten minas. 'Put this money to
work,' he said, 'until I come back.'
14"But his subjects hated him and sent a
delegation after him to say, 'We don't
want this man to be our king.'
15"He was made king, however, and
returned home. Then he sent for the
servants to whom he had given the
money, in order to find out what they
had gained with it.
16"The first one came and said, 'Sir, your
mina has earned ten more.'
17" 'Well done, my good servant!' his
master replied. 'Because you have been
trustworthy in a very small matter, take
charge of ten cities.'
18"The second came and said, 'Sir, your
mina has earned five more.'
19"His master answered, 'You take
charge of five cities.'
20"Then another servant came and said,
'Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid
away in a piece of cloth.
21I was afraid of you, because you are a
hard man. You take out what you did not
put in and reap what you did not sow.'
22"His master replied, 'I will judge you by
your own words, you wicked servant!
You knew, did you, that I am a hard man,
taking out what I did not put in, and
reaping what I did not sow?
23Why then didn't you put my money on
deposit, so that when I came back, I
could have collected it with interest?'
24"Then he said to those standing by,
'Take his mina away from him and give
it to the one who has ten minas.'
25" 'Sir,' they said, 'he already has ten!'
26"He replied, 'I tell you that to everyone
who has, more will be given, but as for
the one who has nothing, even what he
has will be taken away.
27But those enemies of mine who did not
want me to be king over them--bring
them here and kill them in front of me.' "
28After Jesus had said this, he went on
ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
29As he approached Bethphage and
Bethany at the hill called the Mount of
Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
saying to them,
30"Go to the village ahead of you, and as
you enter it, you will find a colt tied there,
which no one has ever ridden. Untie it
and bring it here.
31If anyone asks you, 'Why are you
untying it?' tell him, 'The Lord needs it.' "
32Those who were sent ahead went and
found it just as he had told them.
33As they were untying the colt, its
owners asked them, "Why are you
untying the colt?"
34They replied, "The Lord needs it."
35They brought it to Jesus, threw their
cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.
36As he went along, people spread their
cloaks on the road.
37When he came near the place where
the road goes down the Mount of Olives,
the whole crowd of disciples began
joyfully to praise God in loud voices for
all the miracles they had seen:
38"Blessed is the king who comes in the
name of the Lord!" "Peace in heaven
and glory in the highest!"
39Some of the Pharisees in the crowd
said to Jesus, "Teacher, rebuke your
disciples!"
40"I tell you," he replied, "if they keep
quiet, the stones will cry out."
41As he approached Jerusalem and saw
the city, he wept over it
42and said, "If you, even you, had only
known on this day what would bring you
peace--but now it is hidden from your
eyes.
43The days will come upon you when
your enemies will build an embankment
against you and encircle you and hem
you in on every side.
44They will dash you to the ground, you
and the children within your walls. They
will not leave one stone on another,
because you did not recognize the time
of God's coming to you."
45Then he entered the temple area and
began driving out those who were
selling.
46"It is written," he said to them, " 'My
house will be a house of prayer' ; but
you have made it 'a den of robbers.' "
47Every day he was teaching at the
temple. But the chief priests, the
teachers of the law and the leaders
among the people were trying to kill him.
48Yet they could not find any way to do it,
because all the people hung on his
words.
20One day as he was teaching the
people in the temple courts and
preaching the gospel, the chief priests
and the teachers of the law, together
with the elders, came up to him.
2"Tell us by what authority you are doing
these things," they said. "Who gave you
this authority?"
3He replied, "I will also ask you a
question. Tell me,
4John's baptism--was it from heaven, or
from men?"
5They discussed it among themselves
and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he
will ask, 'Why didn't you believe him?'
6But if we say, 'From men,' all the
people will stone us, because they are
persuaded that John was a prophet."
7So they answered, "We don't know
where it was from."
8Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by
what authority I am doing these things."
9He went on to tell the people this
parable: "A man planted a vineyard,
rented it to some farmers and went
away for a long time.
10At harvest time he sent a servant to
the tenants so they would give him
some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the
tenants beat him and sent him away
empty-handed.
11He sent another servant, but that one
also they beat and treated shamefully
and sent away empty-handed.
12He sent still a third, and they wounded
him and threw him out.
13"Then the owner of the vineyard said,
'What shall I do? I will send my son,
whom I love; perhaps they will respect
him.'
14"But when the tenants saw him, they
talked the matter over. 'This is the heir,'
they said. 'Let's kill him, and the
inheritance will be ours.'
15So they threw him out of the vineyard
and killed him.
16"What then will the owner of the
vineyard do to them? He will come and
kill those tenants and give the vineyard
to others." When the people heard this,
they said, "May this never be!"
17Jesus looked directly at them and
asked, "Then what is the meaning of
that which is written: " 'The stone the
builders rejected has become the
capstone ' ?
18Everyone who falls on that stone will
be broken to pieces, but he on whom it
falls will be crushed."
19The teachers of the law and the chief
priests looked for a way to arrest him
immediately, because they knew he had
spoken this parable against them. But
they were afraid of the people.
20Keeping a close watch on him, they
sent spies, who pretended to be honest.
They hoped to catch Jesus in something
he said so that they might hand him
over to the power and authority of the
governor.
21So the spies questioned him: "Teacher,
we know that you speak and teach what
is right, and that you do not show
partiality but teach the way of God in
accordance with the truth.
22Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar
or not?"
23He saw through their duplicity and said
to them,
24"Show me a denarius. Whose portrait
and inscription are on it?"
25"Caesar's," they replied. He said to
them, "Then give to Caesar what is
Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
26They were unable to trap him in what
he had said there in public. And
astonished by his answer, they became
silent.
27Some of the Sadducees, who say
there is no resurrection, came to Jesus
with a question.
28"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for
us that if a man's brother dies and
leaves a wife but no children, the man
must marry the widow and have children
for his brother.
29Now there were seven brothers. The
first one married a woman and died
childless.
30The second
31and then the third married her, and in
the same way the seven died, leaving
no children.
32Finally, the woman died too.
33Now then, at the resurrection whose
wife will she be, since the seven were
married to her?"
34Jesus replied, "The people of this age
marry and are given in marriage.
35But those who are considered worthy
of taking part in that age and in the
resurrection from the dead will neither
marry nor be given in marriage,
36and they can no longer die; for they
are like the angels. They are God's
children, since they are children of the
resurrection.
37But in the account of the bush, even
Moses showed that the dead rise, for he
calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham, and
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'
38He is not the God of the dead, but of
the living, for to him all are alive."
39Some of the teachers of the law
responded, "Well said, teacher!"
40And no one dared to ask him any more
questions.
41Then Jesus said to them, "How is it
that they say the Christ is the Son of
David?
42David himself declares in the Book of
Psalms: " 'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit
at my right hand
43until I make your enemies a footstool
for your feet." '
44David calls him 'Lord.' How then can
he be his son?"
45While all the people were listening,
Jesus said to his disciples,
46"Beware of the teachers of the law.
They like to walk around in flowing
robes and love to be greeted in the
marketplaces and have the most
important seats in the synagogues and
the places of honor at banquets.
47They devour widows' houses and for a
show make lengthy prayers. Such men
will be punished most severely."
21As he looked up, Jesus saw the
rich putting their gifts into the temple
treasury.
2He also saw a poor widow put in two
very small copper coins.
3"I tell you the truth," he said, "this poor
widow has put in more than all the
others.
4All these people gave their gifts out of
their wealth; but she out of her poverty
put in all she had to live on."
5Some of his disciples were remarking
about how the temple was adorned with
beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated
to God. But Jesus said,
6"As for what you see here, the time will
come when not one stone will be left on
another; every one of them will be
thrown down."
7"Teacher," they asked, "when will these
things happen? And what will be the
sign that they are about to take place?"
8He replied: "Watch out that you are not
deceived. For many will come in my
name, claiming, 'I am he,' and, 'The time
is near.' Do not follow them.
9When you hear of wars and revolutions,
do not be frightened. These things must
happen first, but the end will not come
right away."
10Then he said to them: "Nation will rise
against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom.
11There will be great earthquakes,
famines and pestilences in various
places, and fearful events and great
signs from heaven.
12"But before all this, they will lay hands
on you and persecute you. They will
deliver you to synagogues and prisons,
and you will be brought before kings and
governors, and all on account of my
name.
13This will result in your being witnesses
to them.
14But make up your mind not to worry
beforehand how you will defend
yourselves.
15For I will give you words and wisdom
that none of your adversaries will be
able to resist or contradict.
16You will be betrayed even by parents,
brothers, relatives and friends, and they
will put some of you to death.
17All men will hate you because of me.
18But not a hair of your head will perish.
19By standing firm you will gain life.
20"When you see Jerusalem being
surrounded by armies, you will know
that its desolation is near.
21Then let those who are in Judea flee to
the mountains, let those in the city get
out, and let those in the country not
enter the city.
22For this is the time of punishment in
fulfillment of all that has been written.
23How dreadful it will be in those days
for pregnant women and nursing
mothers! There will be great distress in
the land and wrath against this people.
24They will fall by the sword and will be
taken as prisoners to all the nations.
Jerusalem will be trampled on by the
Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles
are fulfilled.
25"There will be signs in the sun, moon
and stars. On the earth, nations will be
in anguish and perplexity at the roaring
and tossing of the sea.
26Men will faint from terror,
apprehensive of what is coming on the
world, for the heavenly bodies will be
shaken.
27At that time they will see the Son of
Man coming in a cloud with power and
great glory.
28When these things begin to take place,
stand up and lift up your heads,
because your redemption is drawing
near."
29He told them this parable: "Look at the
fig tree and all the trees.
30When they sprout leaves, you can see
for yourselves and know that summer is
near.
31Even so, when you see these things
happening, you know that the kingdom
of God is near.
32"I tell you the truth, this generation will
certainly not pass away until all these
things have happened.
33Heaven and earth will pass away, but
my words will never pass away.
34"Be careful, or your hearts will be
weighed down with dissipation,
drunkenness and the anxieties of life,
and that day will close on you
unexpectedly like a trap.
35For it will come upon all those who live
on the face of the whole earth.
36Be always on the watch, and pray that
you may be able to escape all that is
about to happen, and that you may be
able to stand before the Son of Man."
37Each day Jesus was teaching at the
temple, and each evening he went out
to spend the night on the hill called the
Mount of Olives,
38and all the people came early in the
morning to hear him at the temple.
22Now the Feast of Unleavened
Bread, called the Passover, was
approaching,
2and the chief priests and the teachers
of the law were looking for some way to
get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of
the people.
3Then Satan entered Judas, called
Iscariot, one of the Twelve.
4And Judas went to the chief priests and
the officers of the temple guard and
discussed with them how he might
betray Jesus.
5They were delighted and agreed to give
him money.
6He consented, and watched for an
opportunity to hand Jesus over to them
when no crowd was present.
7Then came the day of Unleavened
Bread on which the Passover lamb had
to be sacrificed.
8Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go
and make preparations for us to eat the
Passover."
9"Where do you want us to prepare for
it?" they asked.
10He replied, "As you enter the city, a
man carrying a jar of water will meet you.
Follow him to the house that he enters,
11and say to the owner of the house,
'The Teacher asks: Where is the guest
room, where I may eat the Passover
with my disciples?'
12He will show you a large upper room,
all furnished. Make preparations there."
13They left and found things just as
Jesus had told them. So they prepared
the Passover.
14When the hour came, Jesus and his
apostles reclined at the table.
15And he said to them, "I have eagerly
desired to eat this Passover with you
before I suffer.
16For I tell you, I will not eat it again until
it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of
God."
17After taking the cup, he gave thanks
and said, "Take this and divide it among
you.
18For I tell you I will not drink again of
the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of
God comes."
19And he took bread, gave thanks and
broke it, and gave it to them, saying,
"This is my body given for you; do this in
remembrance of me."
20In the same way, after the supper he
took the cup, saying, "This cup is the
new covenant in my blood, which is
poured out for you.
21But the hand of him who is going to
betray me is with mine on the table.
22The Son of Man will go as it has been
decreed, but woe to that man who
betrays him."
23They began to question among
themselves which of them it might be
who would do this.
24Also a dispute arose among them as
to which of them was considered to be
greatest.
25Jesus said to them, "The kings of the
Gentiles lord it over them; and those
who exercise authority over them call
themselves Benefactors.
26But you are not to be like that. Instead,
the greatest among you should be like
the youngest, and the one who rules like
the one who serves.
27For who is greater, the one who is at
the table or the one who serves? Is it
not the one who is at the table? But I am
among you as one who serves.
28You are those who have stood by me
in my trials.
29And I confer on you a kingdom, just as
my Father conferred one on me,
30so that you may eat and drink at my
table in my kingdom and sit on thrones,
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
31"Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift
you as wheat.
32But I have prayed for you, Simon, that
your faith may not fail. And when you
have turned back, strengthen your
brothers."
33But he replied, "Lord, I am ready to go
with you to prison and to death."
34Jesus answered, "I tell you, Peter,
before the rooster crows today, you will
deny three times that you know me."
35Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent
you without purse, bag or sandals, did
you lack anything?" "Nothing," they
answered.
36He said to them, "But now if you have
a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if
you don't have a sword, sell your cloak
and buy one.
37It is written: 'And he was numbered
with the transgressors' ; and I tell you
that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes,
what is written about me is reaching its
fulfillment."
38The disciples said, "See, Lord, here
are two swords." "That is enough," he
replied.
39Jesus went out as usual to the Mount
of Olives, and his disciples followed him.
40On reaching the place, he said to them,
"Pray that you will not fall into
temptation."
41He withdrew about a stone's throw
beyond them, knelt down and prayed,
42"Father, if you are willing, take this cup
from me; yet not my will, but yours be
done."
43An angel from heaven appeared to
him and strengthened him.
44And being in anguish, he prayed more
earnestly, and his sweat was like drops
of blood falling to the ground.
45When he rose from prayer and went
back to the disciples, he found them
asleep, exhausted from sorrow.
46"Why are you sleeping?" he asked
them. "Get up and pray so that you will
not fall into temptation."
47While he was still speaking a crowd
came up, and the man who was called
Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading
them. He approached Jesus to kiss him,
48but Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you
betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
49When Jesus' followers saw what was
going to happen, they said, "Lord,
should we strike with our swords?"
50And one of them struck the servant of
the high priest, cutting off his right ear.
51But Jesus answered, "No more of
this!" And he touched the man's ear and
healed him.
52Then Jesus said to the chief priests,
the officers of the temple guard, and the
elders, who had come for him, "Am I
leading a rebellion, that you have come
with swords and clubs?
53Every day I was with you in the temple
courts, and you did not lay a hand on
me. But this is your hour--when
darkness reigns."
54Then seizing him, they led him away
and took him into the house of the high
priest. Peter followed at a distance.
55But when they had kindled a fire in the
middle of the courtyard and had sat
down together, Peter sat down with
them.
56A servant girl saw him seated there in
the firelight. She looked closely at him
and said, "This man was with him."
57But he denied it. "Woman, I don't know
him," he said.
58A little later someone else saw him
and said, "You also are one of them."
"Man, I am not!" Peter replied.
59About an hour later another asserted,
"Certainly this fellow was with him, for
he is a Galilean."
60Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what
you're talking about!" Just as he was
speaking, the rooster crowed.
61The Lord turned and looked straight at
Peter. Then Peter remembered the word
the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the
rooster crows today, you will disown me
three times."
62And he went outside and wept bitterly.
63The men who were guarding Jesus
began mocking and beating him.
64They blindfolded him and demanded,
"Prophesy! Who hit you?"
65And they said many other insulting
things to him.
66At daybreak the council of the elders
of the people, both the chief priests and
teachers of the law, met together, and
Jesus was led before them.
67"If you are the Christ, " they said, "tell
us."
68Jesus answered, "If I tell you, you will
not believe me, and if I asked you, you
would not answer.
69But from now on, the Son of Man will
be seated at the right hand of the mighty
God."
70They all asked, "Are you then the Son
of God?" He replied, "You are right in
saying I am."
71Then they said, "Why do we need any
more testimony? We have heard it from
his own lips."
23Then the whole assembly rose
and led him off to Pilate.
2And they began to accuse him, saying,
"We have found this man subverting our
nation. He opposes payment of taxes to
Caesar and claims to be Christ, a king."
3So Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the
king of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you
say," Jesus replied.
4Then Pilate announced to the chief
priests and the crowd, "I find no basis
for a charge against this man."
5But they insisted, "He stirs up the
people all over Judea by his teaching.
He started in Galilee and has come all
the way here."
6On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man
was a Galilean.
7When he learned that Jesus was under
Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to
Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at
that time.
8When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly
pleased, because for a long time he had
been wanting to see him. From what he
had heard about him, he hoped to see
him perform some miracle.
9He plied him with many questions, but
Jesus gave him no answer.
10The chief priests and the teachers of
the law were standing there, vehemently
accusing him.
11Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed
and mocked him. Dressing him in an
elegant robe, they sent him back to
Pilate.
12That day Herod and Pilate became
friends--before this they had been
enemies.
13Pilate called together the chief priests,
the rulers and the people,
14and said to them, "You brought me this
man as one who was inciting the people
to rebellion. I have examined him in your
presence and have found no basis for
your charges against him.
15Neither has Herod, for he sent him
back to us; as you can see, he has done
nothing to deserve death.
16Therefore, I will punish him and then
release him."
18With one voice they cried out, "Away
with this man! Release Barabbas to us!"
19(Barabbas had been thrown into prison
for an insurrection in the city, and for
murder.)
20Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate
appealed to them again.
21But they kept shouting, "Crucify him!
Crucify him!"
22For the third time he spoke to them:
"Why? What crime has this man
committed? I have found in him no
grounds for the death penalty. Therefore
I will have him punished and then
release him."
23But with loud shouts they insistently
demanded that he be crucified, and their
shouts prevailed.
24So Pilate decided to grant their
demand.
25He released the man who had been
thrown into prison for insurrection and
murder, the one they asked for, and
surrendered Jesus to their will.
26As they led him away, they seized
Simon from Cyrene, who was on his
way in from the country, and put the
cross on him and made him carry it
behind Jesus.
27A large number of people followed him,
including women who mourned and
wailed for him.
28Jesus turned and said to them,
"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep
for me; weep for yourselves and for your
children.
29For the time will come when you will
say, 'Blessed are the barren women, the
wombs that never bore and the breasts
that never nursed!'
30Then " 'they will say to the mountains,
"Fall on us!" and to the hills, "Cover us!"
'
31For if men do these things when the
tree is green, what will happen when it is
dry?"
32Two other men, both criminals, were
also led out with him to be executed.
33When they came to the place called
the Skull, there they crucified him, along
with the criminals--one on his right, the
other on his left.
34Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for
they do not know what they are doing."
And they divided up his clothes by
casting lots.
35The people stood watching, and the
rulers even sneered at him. They said,
"He saved others; let him save himself if
he is the Christ of God, the Chosen
One."
36The soldiers also came up and
mocked him. They offered him wine
vinegar
37and said, "If you are the king of the
Jews, save yourself."
38There was a written notice above him,
which read:
39One of the criminals who hung there
hurled insults at him: "Aren't you the
Christ? Save yourself and us!"
40But the other criminal rebuked him.
"Don't you fear God," he said, "since you
are under the same sentence?
41We are punished justly, for we are
getting what our deeds deserve. But this
man has done nothing wrong."
42Then he said, "Jesus, remember me
when you come into your kingdom. "
43Jesus answered him, "I tell you the
truth, today you will be with me in
paradise."
44It was now about the sixth hour, and
darkness came over the whole land until
the ninth hour,
45for the sun stopped shining. And the
curtain of the temple was torn in two.
46Jesus called out with a loud voice,
"Father, into your hands I commit my
spirit." When he had said this, he
breathed his last.
47The centurion, seeing what had
happened, praised God and said,
"Surely this was a righteous man."
48When all the people who had gathered
to witness this sight saw what took place,
they beat their breasts and went away.
49But all those who knew him, including
the women who had followed him from
Galilee, stood at a distance, watching
these things.
50Now there was a man named Joseph,
a member of the Council, a good and
upright man,
51who had not consented to their
decision and action. He came from the
Judean town of Arimathea and he was
waiting for the kingdom of God.
52Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus'
body.
53Then he took it down, wrapped it in
linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in
the rock, one in which no one had yet
been laid.
54It was Preparation Day, and the
Sabbath was about to begin.
55The women who had come with Jesus
from Galilee followed Joseph and saw
the tomb and how his body was laid in it.
56Then they went home and prepared
spices and perfumes. But they rested on
the Sabbath in obedience to the
commandment.
24On the first day of the week, very
early in the morning, the women took
the spices they had prepared and went
to the tomb.
2They found the stone rolled away from
the tomb,
3but when they entered, they did not find
the body of the Lord Jesus.
4While they were wondering about this,
suddenly two men in clothes that
gleamed like lightning stood beside
them.
5In their fright the women bowed down
with their faces to the ground, but the
men said to them, "Why do you look for
the living among the dead?
6He is not here; he has risen!
Remember how he told you, while he
was still with you in Galilee:
7'The Son of Man must be delivered into
the hands of sinful men, be crucified and
on the third day be raised again.' "
8Then they remembered his words.
9When they came back from the tomb,
they told all these things to the Eleven
and to all the others.
10It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary
the mother of James, and the others
with them who told this to the apostles.
11But they did not believe the women,
because their words seemed to them
like nonsense.
12Peter, however, got up and ran to the
tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of
linen lying by themselves, and he went
away, wondering to himself what had
happened.
13Now that same day two of them were
going to a village called Emmaus, about
seven miles from Jerusalem.
14They were talking with each other
about everything that had happened.
15As they talked and discussed these
things with each other, Jesus himself
came up and walked along with them;
16but they were kept from recognizing
him.
17He asked them, "What are you
discussing together as you walk along?"
18They stood still, their faces downcast.
One of them, named Cleopas, asked
him, "Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem
and do not know the things that have
happened there in these days?"
19"What things?" he asked.
20"About Jesus of Nazareth," they
replied. "He was a prophet, powerful in
word and deed before God and all the
people. The chief priests and our rulers
handed him over to be sentenced to
death, and they crucified him;
21but we had hoped that he was the one
who was going to redeem Israel. And
what is more, it is the third day since all
this took place.
22In addition, some of our women
amazed us. They went to the tomb early
this morning
23but didn't find his body. They came
and told us that they had seen a vision
of angels, who said he was alive.
24Then some of our companions went to
the tomb and found it just as the women
had said, but him they did not see."
25He said to them, "How foolish you are,
and how slow of heart to believe all that
the prophets have spoken!
26Did not the Christ have to suffer these
things and then enter his glory?"
27And beginning with Moses and all the
Prophets, he explained to them what
was said in all the Scriptures concerning
himself.
28As they approached the village to
which they were going, Jesus acted as if
he were going farther.
29But they urged him strongly, "Stay with
us, for it is nearly evening; the day is
almost over." So he went in to stay with
them.
30When he was at the table with them,
he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and
began to give it to them.
31Then their eyes were opened and they
recognized him, and he disappeared
from their sight.
32They asked each other, "Were not our
hearts burning within us while he talked
with us on the road and opened the
Scriptures to us?"
33They got up and returned at once to
Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven
and those with them, assembled
together
34and saying, "It is true! The Lord has
risen and has appeared to Simon."
35Then the two told what had happened
on the way, and how Jesus was
recognized by them when he broke the
bread.
36While they were still talking about this,
Jesus himself stood among them and
said to them, "Peace be with you."
37They were startled and frightened,
thinking they saw a ghost.
38He said to them, "Why are you
troubled, and why do doubts rise in your
minds?
39Look at my hands and my feet. It is I
myself! Touch me and see; a ghost
does not have flesh and bones, as you
see I have."
40When he had said this, he showed
them his hands and feet.
41And while they still did not believe it
because of joy and amazement, he
asked them, "Do you have anything
here to eat?"
42They gave him a piece of broiled fish,
43and he took it and ate it in their
presence.
44He said to them, "This is what I told
you while I was still with you: Everything
must be fulfilled that is written about me
in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and
the Psalms."
45Then he opened their minds so they
could understand the Scriptures.
46He told them, "This is what is written:
The Christ will suffer and rise from the
dead on the third day,
47and repentance and forgiveness of
sins will be preached in his name to all
nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
48You are witnesses of these things.
49I am going to send you what my
Father has promised; but stay in the city
until you have been clothed with power
from on high."
50When he had led them out to the
vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his
hands and blessed them.
51While he was blessing them, he left
them and was taken up into heaven.
52Then they worshiped him and returned
to Jerusalem with great joy.
53And they stayed continually at the
temple, praising God.
John
1In the beginning was the Word, and
the Word was with God, and the Word
was God.
2He was with God in the beginning.
3Through him all things were made;
without him nothing was made that has
been made.
4In him was life, and that life was the
light of men.
5The light shines in the darkness, but
the darkness has not understood it.
6There came a man who was sent from
God; his name was John.
7He came as a witness to testify
concerning that light, so that through
him all men might believe.
8He himself was not the light; he came
only as a witness to the light.
9The true light that gives light to every
man was coming into the world.
10He was in the world, and though the
world was made through him, the world
did not recognize him.
11He came to that which was his own,
but his own did not receive him.
12Yet to all who received him, to those
who believed in his name, he gave the
right to become children of God--
13children born not of natural descent,
nor of human decision or a husband's
will, but born of God.
14The Word became flesh and made his
dwelling among us. We have seen his
glory, the glory of the One and Only,
who came from the Father, full of grace
and truth.
15John testifies concerning him. He cries
out, saying, "This was he of whom I said,
'He who comes after me has surpassed
me because he was before me.' "
16From the fullness of his grace we have
all received one blessing after another.
17For the law was given through Moses;
grace and truth came through Jesus
Christ.
18No one has ever seen God, but God
the One and Only, , who is at the
Father's side, has made him known.
19Now this was John's testimony when
the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and
Levites to ask him who he was.
20He did not fail to confess, but
confessed freely, "I am not the Christ. "
21They asked him, "Then who are you?
Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not."
"Are you the Prophet?" He answered,
"No."
22Finally they said, "Who are you? Give
us an answer to take back to those who
sent us. What do you say about
yourself?"
23John replied in the words of Isaiah the
prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in
the desert, 'Make straight the way for
the Lord.' "
24Now some Pharisees who had been
sent
25questioned him, "Why then do you
baptize if you are not the Christ, nor
Elijah, nor the Prophet?"
26"I baptize with water," John replied,
"but among you stands one you do not
know.
27He is the one who comes after me, the
thongs of whose sandals I am not
worthy to untie."
28This all happened at Bethany on the
other side of the Jordan, where John
was baptizing.
29The next day John saw Jesus coming
toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of
God, who takes away the sin of the
world!
30This is the one I meant when I said, 'A
man who comes after me has
surpassed me because he was before
me.'
31I myself did not know him, but the
reason I came baptizing with water was
that he might be revealed to Israel."
32Then John gave this testimony: "I saw
the Spirit come down from heaven as a
dove and remain on him.
33I would not have known him, except
that the one who sent me to baptize with
water told me, 'The man on whom you
see the Spirit come down and remain is
he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'
34I have seen and I testify that this is the
Son of God."
35The next day John was there again
with two of his disciples.
36When he saw Jesus passing by, he
said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"
37When the two disciples heard him say
this, they followed Jesus.
38Turning around, Jesus saw them
following and asked, "What do you
want?" They said, "Rabbi" (which means
Teacher), "where are you staying?"
39"Come," he replied, "and you will see."
So they went and saw where he was
staying, and spent that day with him. It
was about the tenth hour.
40Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was
one of the two who heard what John
had said and who had followed Jesus.
41The first thing Andrew did was to find
his brother Simon and tell him, "We
have found the Messiah" (that is, the
Christ).
42And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus
looked at him and said, "You are Simon
son of John. You will be called Cephas"
(which, when translated, is Peter ).
43The next day Jesus decided to leave
for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him,
"Follow me."
44Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was
from the town of Bethsaida.
45Philip found Nathanael and told him,
"We have found the one Moses wrote
about in the Law, and about whom the
prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth,
the son of Joseph."
46"Nazareth! Can anything good come
from there?" Nathanael asked. "Come
and see," said Philip.
47When Jesus saw Nathanael
approaching, he said of him, "Here is a
true Israelite, in whom there is nothing
false."
48"How do you know me?" Nathanael
asked. Jesus answered, "I saw you
while you were still under the fig tree
before Philip called you."
49Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you
are the Son of God; you are the King of
Israel."
50Jesus said, "You believe because I
told you I saw you under the fig tree.
You shall see greater things than that."
51He then added, "I tell you the truth,
you shall see heaven open, and the
angels of God ascending and
descending on the Son of Man."
2On the third day a wedding took
place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother
was there,
2and Jesus and his disciples had also
been invited to the wedding.
3When the wine was gone, Jesus'
mother said to him, "They have no more
wine."
4"Dear woman, why do you involve me?"
Jesus replied, "My time has not yet
come."
5His mother said to the servants, "Do
whatever he tells you."
6Nearby stood six stone water jars, the
kind used by the Jews for ceremonial
washing, each holding from twenty to
thirty gallons.
7Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars
with water"; so they filled them to the
brim.
8Then he told them, "Now draw some
out and take it to the master of the
banquet."
9They did so, and the master of the
banquet tasted the water that had been
turned into wine. He did not realize
where it had come from, though the
servants who had drawn the water knew.
Then he called the bridegroom aside
10and said, "Everyone brings out the
choice wine first and then the cheaper
wine after the guests have had too
much to drink; but you have saved the
best till now."
11This, the first of his miraculous signs,
Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. He
thus revealed his glory, and his disciples
put their faith in him.
12After this he went down to Capernaum
with his mother and brothers and his
disciples. There they stayed for a few
days.
13When it was almost time for the
Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to
Jerusalem.
14In the temple courts he found men
selling cattle, sheep and doves, and
others sitting at tables exchanging
money.
15So he made a whip out of cords, and
drove all from the temple area, both
sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins
of the money changers and overturned
their tables.
16To those who sold doves he said, "Get
these out of here! How dare you turn my
Father's house into a market!"
17His disciples remembered that it is
written: "Zeal for your house will
consume me."
18Then the Jews demanded of him,
"What miraculous sign can you show us
to prove your authority to do all this?"
19Jesus answered them, "Destroy this
temple, and I will raise it again in three
days."
20The Jews replied, "It has taken fortysix
years to build this temple, and you
are going to raise it in three days?"
21But the temple he had spoken of was
his body.
22After he was raised from the dead, his
disciples recalled what he had said.
Then they believed the Scripture and
the words that Jesus had spoken.
23Now while he was in Jerusalem at the
Passover Feast, many people saw the
miraculous signs he was doing and
believed in his name.
24But Jesus would not entrust himself to
them, for he knew all men.
25He did not need man's testimony
about man, for he knew what was in a
man.
3Now there was a man of the
Pharisees named Nicodemus, a
member of the Jewish ruling council.
2He came to Jesus at night and said,
"Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who
has come from God. For no one could
perform the miraculous signs you are
doing if God were not with him."
3In reply Jesus declared, "I tell you the
truth, no one can see the kingdom of
God unless he is born again. "
4"How can a man be born when he is
old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely he
cannot enter a second time into his
mother's womb to be born!"
5Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no
one can enter the kingdom of God
unless he is born of water and the Spirit.
6Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit
gives birth to spirit.
7You should not be surprised at my
saying, 'You must be born again.'
8The wind blows wherever it pleases.
You hear its sound, but you cannot tell
where it comes from or where it is going.
So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."
9"How can this be?" Nicodemus asked.
10"You are Israel's teacher," said Jesus,
"and do you not understand these
things?
11I tell you the truth, we speak of what
we know, and we testify to what we
have seen, but still you people do not
accept our testimony.
12I have spoken to you of earthly things
and you do not believe; how then will
you believe if I speak of heavenly
things?
13No one has ever gone into heaven
except the one who came from heaven--
the Son of Man.
14Just as Moses lifted up the snake in
the desert, so the Son of Man must be
lifted up,
15that everyone who believes in him may
have eternal life.
16"For God so loved the world that he
gave his one and only Son, that
whoever believes in him shall not perish
but have eternal life.
17For God did not send his Son into the
world to condemn the world, but to save
the world through him.
18Whoever believes in him is not
condemned, but whoever does not
believe stands condemned already
because he has not believed in the
name of God's one and only Son.
19This is the verdict: Light has come into
the world, but men loved darkness
instead of light because their deeds
were evil.
20Everyone who does evil hates the light,
and will not come into the light for fear
that his deeds will be exposed.
21But whoever lives by the truth comes
into the light, so that it may be seen
plainly that what he has done has been
done through God."
22After this, Jesus and his disciples went
out into the Judean countryside, where
he spent some time with them, and
baptized.
23Now John also was baptizing at Aenon
near Salim, because there was plenty of
water, and people were constantly
coming to be baptized.
24(This was before John was put in
prison.)
25An argument developed between
some of John's disciples and a certain
Jew over the matter of ceremonial
washing.
26They came to John and said to him,
"Rabbi, that man who was with you on
the other side of the Jordan--the one
you testified about--well, he is baptizing,
and everyone is going to him."
27To this John replied, "A man can
receive only what is given him from
heaven.
28You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I
am not the Christ but am sent ahead of
him.'
29The bride belongs to the bridegroom.
The friend who attends the bridegroom
waits and listens for him, and is full of
joy when he hears the bridegroom's
voice. That joy is mine, and it is now
complete.
30He must become greater; I must
become less.
31"The one who comes from above is
above all; the one who is from the earth
belongs to the earth, and speaks as one
from the earth. The one who comes
from heaven is above all.
32He testifies to what he has seen and
heard, but no one accepts his testimony.
33The man who has accepted it has
certified that God is truthful.
34For the one whom God has sent
speaks the words of God, for God gives
the Spirit without limit.
35The Father loves the Son and has
placed everything in his hands.
36Whoever believes in the Son has
eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son
will not see life, for God's wrath remains
on him."
4The Pharisees heard that Jesus was
gaining and baptizing more disciples
than John,
2although in fact it was not Jesus who
baptized, but his disciples.
3When the Lord learned of this, he left
Judea and went back once more to
Galilee.
4Now he had to go through Samaria.
5So he came to a town in Samaria called
Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob
had given to his son Joseph.
6Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired
as he was from the journey, sat down by
the well. It was about the sixth hour.
7When a Samaritan woman came to
draw water, Jesus said to her, "Will you
give me a drink?"
8(His disciples had gone into the town to
buy food.)
9The Samaritan woman said to him,
"You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan
woman. How can you ask me for a
drink?" (For Jews do not associate with
Samaritans. )
10Jesus answered her, "If you knew the
gift of God and who it is that asks you
for a drink, you would have asked him
and he would have given you living
water."
11"Sir," the woman said, "you have
nothing to draw with and the well is
deep. Where can you get this living
water?
12Are you greater than our father Jacob,
who gave us the well and drank from it
himself, as did also his sons and his
flocks and herds?"
13Jesus answered, "Everyone who
drinks this water will be thirsty again,
14but whoever drinks the water I give
him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I
give him will become in him a spring of
water welling up to eternal life."
15The woman said to him, "Sir, give me
this water so that I won't get thirsty and
have to keep coming here to draw
water."
16He told her, "Go, call your husband
and come back."
17"I have no husband," she replied.
18Jesus said to her, "You are right when
you say you have no husband. The fact
is, you have had five husbands, and the
man you now have is not your husband.
What you have just said is quite true."
19"Sir," the woman said, "I can see that
you are a prophet.
20Our fathers worshiped on this
mountain, but you Jews claim that the
place where we must worship is in
Jerusalem."
21Jesus declared, "Believe me, woman,
a time is coming when you will worship
the Father neither on this mountain nor
in Jerusalem.
22You Samaritans worship what you do
not know; we worship what we do know,
for salvation is from the Jews.
23Yet a time is coming and has now
come when the true worshipers will
worship the Father in spirit and truth, for
they are the kind of worshipers the
Father seeks.
24God is spirit, and his worshipers must
worship in spirit and in truth."
25The woman said, "I know that
Messiah" (called Christ) "is coming.
When he comes, he will explain
everything to us."
26Then Jesus declared, "I who speak to
you am he."
27Just then his disciples returned and
were surprised to find him talking with a
woman. But no one asked, "What do
you want?" or "Why are you talking with
her?"
28Then, leaving her water jar, the
woman went back to the town and said
to the people,
29"Come, see a man who told me
everything I ever did. Could this be the
Christ ?"
30They came out of the town and made
their way toward him.
31Meanwhile his disciples urged him,
"Rabbi, eat something."
32But he said to them, "I have food to eat
that you know nothing about."
33Then his disciples said to each other,
"Could someone have brought him
food?"
34"My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will
of him who sent me and to finish his
work.
35Do you not say, 'Four months more
and then the harvest'? I tell you, open
your eyes and look at the fields! They
are ripe for harvest.
36Even now the reaper draws his wages,
even now he harvests the crop for
eternal life, so that the sower and the
reaper may be glad together.
37Thus the saying 'One sows and
another reaps' is true.
38I sent you to reap what you have not
worked for. Others have done the hard
work, and you have reaped the benefits
of their labor."
39Many of the Samaritans from that town
believed in him because of the woman's
testimony, "He told me everything I ever
did."
40So when the Samaritans came to him,
they urged him to stay with them, and
he stayed two days.
41And because of his words many more
became believers.
42They said to the woman, "We no
longer believe just because of what you
said; now we have heard for ourselves,
and we know that this man really is the
Savior of the world."
43After the two days he left for Galilee.
44(Now Jesus himself had pointed out
that a prophet has no honor in his own
country.)
45When he arrived in Galilee, the
Galileans welcomed him. They had
seen all that he had done in Jerusalem
at the Passover Feast, for they also had
been there.
46Once more he visited Cana in Galilee,
where he had turned the water into wine.
And there was a certain royal official
whose son lay sick at Capernaum.
47When this man heard that Jesus had
arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to
him and begged him to come and heal
his son, who was close to death.
48"Unless you people see miraculous
signs and wonders," Jesus told him,
"you will never believe."
49The royal official said, "Sir, come down
before my child dies."
50Jesus replied, "You may go. Your son
will live." The man took Jesus at his
word and departed.
51While he was still on the way, his
servants met him with the news that his
boy was living.
52When he inquired as to the time when
his son got better, they said to him, "The
fever left him yesterday at the seventh
hour."
53Then the father realized that this was
the exact time at which Jesus had said
to him, "Your son will live." So he and all
his household believed.
54This was the second miraculous sign
that Jesus performed, having come from
Judea to Galilee.
5Some time later, Jesus went up to
Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.
2Now there is in Jerusalem near the
Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is
called Bethesda and which is
surrounded by five covered colonnades.
3Here a great number of disabled people
used to lie--the blind, the lame, the
paralyzed.
5One who was there had been an invalid
for thirty-eight years.
6When Jesus saw him lying there and
learned that he had been in this
condition for a long time, he asked him,
"Do you want to get well?"
7"Sir," the invalid replied, "I have no one
to help me into the pool when the water
is stirred. While I am trying to get in,
someone else goes down ahead of me."
8Then Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick
up your mat and walk."
9At once the man was cured; he picked
up his mat and walked. The day on
which this took place was a Sabbath,
10and so the Jews said to the man who
had been healed, "It is the Sabbath; the
law forbids you to carry your mat."
11But he replied, "The man who made
me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat
and walk.' "
12So they asked him, "Who is this fellow
who told you to pick it up and walk?"
13The man who was healed had no idea
who it was, for Jesus had slipped away
into the crowd that was there.
14Later Jesus found him at the temple
and said to him, "See, you are well
again. Stop sinning or something worse
may happen to you."
15The man went away and told the Jews
that it was Jesus who had made him
well.
16So, because Jesus was doing these
things on the Sabbath, the Jews
persecuted him.
17Jesus said to them, "My Father is
always at his work to this very day, and I,
too, am working."
18For this reason the Jews tried all the
harder to kill him; not only was he
breaking the Sabbath, but he was even
calling God his own Father, making
himself equal with God.
19Jesus gave them this answer: "I tell
you the truth, the Son can do nothing by
himself; he can do only what he sees his
Father doing, because whatever the
Father does the Son also does.
20For the Father loves the Son and
shows him all he does. Yes, to your
amazement he will show him even
greater things than these.
21For just as the Father raises the dead
and gives them life, even so the Son
gives life to whom he is pleased to give
it.
22Moreover, the Father judges no one,
but has entrusted all judgment to the
Son,
23that all may honor the Son just as they
honor the Father. He who does not
honor the Son does not honor the
Father, who sent him.
24"I tell you the truth, whoever hears my
word and believes him who sent me has
eternal life and will not be condemned;
he has crossed over from death to life.
25I tell you the truth, a time is coming
and has now come when the dead will
hear the voice of the Son of God and
those who hear will live.
26For as the Father has life in himself, so
he has granted the Son to have life in
himself.
27And he has given him authority to
judge because he is the Son of Man.
28"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is
coming when all who are in their graves
will hear his voice
29and come out--those who have done
good will rise to live, and those who
have done evil will rise to be
condemned.
30By myself I can do nothing; I judge
only as I hear, and my judgment is just,
for I seek not to please myself but him
who sent me.
31"If I testify about myself, my testimony
is not valid.
32There is another who testifies in my
favor, and I know that his testimony
about me is valid.
33"You have sent to John and he has
testified to the truth.
34Not that I accept human testimony; but
I mention it that you may be saved.
35John was a lamp that burned and gave
light, and you chose for a time to enjoy
his light.
36"I have testimony weightier than that of
John. For the very work that the Father
has given me to finish, and which I am
doing, testifies that the Father has sent
me.
37And the Father who sent me has
himself testified concerning me. You
have never heard his voice nor seen his
form,
38nor does his word dwell in you, for you
do not believe the one he sent.
39You diligently study the Scriptures
because you think that by them you
possess eternal life. These are the
Scriptures that testify about me,
40yet you refuse to come to me to have
life.
41"I do not accept praise from men,
42but I know you. I know that you do not
have the love of God in your hearts.
43I have come in my Father's name, and
you do not accept me; but if someone
else comes in his own name, you will
accept him.
44How can you believe if you accept
praise from one another, yet make no
effort to obtain the praise that comes
from the only God ?
45"But do not think I will accuse you
before the Father. Your accuser is
Moses, on whom your hopes are set.
46If you believed Moses, you would
believe me, for he wrote about me.
47But since you do not believe what he
wrote, how are you going to believe
what I say?"
6Some time after this, Jesus crossed
to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee
(that is, the Sea of Tiberias),
2and a great crowd of people followed
him because they saw the miraculous
signs he had performed on the sick.
3Then Jesus went up on a mountainside
and sat down with his disciples.
4The Jewish Passover Feast was near.
5When Jesus looked up and saw a great
crowd coming toward him, he said to
Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for
these people to eat?"
6He asked this only to test him, for he
already had in mind what he was going
to do.
7Philip answered him, "Eight months'
wages would not buy enough bread for
each one to have a bite!"
8Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon
Peter's brother, spoke up,
9"Here is a boy with five small barley
loaves and two small fish, but how far
will they go among so many?"
10Jesus said, "Have the people sit
down." There was plenty of grass in that
place, and the men sat down, about five
thousand of them.
11Jesus then took the loaves, gave
thanks, and distributed to those who
were seated as much as they wanted.
He did the same with the fish.
12When they had all had enough to eat,
he said to his disciples, "Gather the
pieces that are left over. Let nothing be
wasted."
13So they gathered them and filled
twelve baskets with the pieces of the
five barley loaves left over by those who
had eaten.
14After the people saw the miraculous
sign that Jesus did, they began to say,
"Surely this is the Prophet who is to
come into the world."
15Jesus, knowing that they intended to
come and make him king by force,
withdrew again to a mountain by himself.
16When evening came, his disciples
went down to the lake,
17where they got into a boat and set off
across the lake for Capernaum. By now
it was dark, and Jesus had not yet
joined them.
18A strong wind was blowing and the
waters grew rough.
19When they had rowed three or three
and a half miles, they saw Jesus
approaching the boat, walking on the
water; and they were terrified.
20But he said to them, "It is I; don't be
afraid."
21Then they were willing to take him into
the boat, and immediately the boat
reached the shore where they were
heading.
22The next day the crowd that had
stayed on the opposite shore of the lake
realized that only one boat had been
there, and that Jesus had not entered it
with his disciples, but that they had gone
away alone.
23Then some boats from Tiberias landed
near the place where the people had
eaten the bread after the Lord had given
thanks.
24Once the crowd realized that neither
Jesus nor his disciples were there, they
got into the boats and went to
Capernaum in search of Jesus.
25When they found him on the other side
of the lake, they asked him, "Rabbi,
when did you get here?"
26Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth,
you are looking for me, not because you
saw miraculous signs but because you
ate the loaves and had your fill.
27Do not work for food that spoils, but for
food that endures to eternal life, which
the Son of Man will give you. On him
God the Father has placed his seal of
approval."
28Then they asked him, "What must we
do to do the works God requires?"
29Jesus answered, "The work of God is
this: to believe in the one he has sent."
30So they asked him, "What miraculous
sign then will you give that we may see
it and believe you? What will you do?
31Our forefathers ate the manna in the
desert; as it is written: 'He gave them
bread from heaven to eat.' "
32Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth,
it is not Moses who has given you the
bread from heaven, but it is my Father
who gives you the true bread from
heaven.
33For the bread of God is he who comes
down from heaven and gives life to the
world."
34"Sir," they said, "from now on give us
this bread."
35Then Jesus declared, "I am the bread
of life. He who comes to me will never
go hungry, and he who believes in me
will never be thirsty.
36But as I told you, you have seen me
and still you do not believe.
37All that the Father gives me will come
to me, and whoever comes to me I will
never drive away.
38For I have come down from heaven
not to do my will but to do the will of him
who sent me.
39And this is the will of him who sent me,
that I shall lose none of all that he has
given me, but raise them up at the last
day.
40For my Father's will is that everyone
who looks to the Son and believes in
him shall have eternal life, and I will
raise him up at the last day."
41At this the Jews began to grumble
about him because he said, "I am the
bread that came down from heaven."
42They said, "Is this not Jesus, the son
of Joseph, whose father and mother we
know? How can he now say, 'I came
down from heaven'?"
43"Stop grumbling among yourselves,"
Jesus answered.
44"No one can come to me unless the
Father who sent me draws him, and I
will raise him up at the last day.
45It is written in the Prophets: 'They will
all be taught by God.' Everyone who
listens to the Father and learns from him
comes to me.
46No one has seen the Father except
the one who is from God; only he has
seen the Father.
47I tell you the truth, he who believes
has everlasting life.
48I am the bread of life.
49Your forefathers ate the manna in the
desert, yet they died.
50But here is the bread that comes down
from heaven, which a man may eat and
not die.
51I am the living bread that came down
from heaven. If anyone eats of this
bread, he will live forever. This bread is
my flesh, which I will give for the life of
the world."
52Then the Jews began to argue sharply
among themselves, "How can this man
give us his flesh to eat?"
53Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth,
unless you eat the flesh of the Son of
Man and drink his blood, you have no
life in you.
54Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my
blood has eternal life, and I will raise
him up at the last day.
55For my flesh is real food and my blood
is real drink.
56Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my
blood remains in me, and I in him.
57Just as the living Father sent me and I
live because of the Father, so the one
who feeds on me will live because of me.
58This is the bread that came down from
heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and
died, but he who feeds on this bread will
live forever."
59He said this while teaching in the
synagogue in Capernaum.
60On hearing it, many of his disciples
said, "This is a hard teaching. Who can
accept it?"
61Aware that his disciples were
grumbling about this, Jesus said to them,
"Does this offend you?
62What if you see the Son of Man
ascend to where he was before!
63The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts
for nothing. The words I have spoken to
you are spirit and they are life.
64Yet there are some of you who do not
believe." For Jesus had known from the
beginning which of them did not believe
and who would betray him.
65He went on to say, "This is why I told
you that no one can come to me unless
the Father has enabled him."
66From this time many of his disciples
turned back and no longer followed him.
67"You do not want to leave too, do
you?" Jesus asked the Twelve.
68Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to
whom shall we go? You have the words
of eternal life.
69We believe and know that you are the
Holy One of God."
70Then Jesus replied, "Have I not
chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you
is a devil!"
71(He meant Judas, the son of Simon
Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve,
was later to betray him.)
7After this, Jesus went around in
Galilee, purposely staying away from
Judea because the Jews there were
waiting to take his life.
2But when the Jewish Feast of
Tabernacles was near,
3Jesus' brothers said to him, "You ought
to leave here and go to Judea, so that
your disciples may see the miracles you
do.
4No one who wants to become a public
figure acts in secret. Since you are
doing these things, show yourself to the
world."
5For even his own brothers did not
believe in him.
6Therefore Jesus told them, "The right
time for me has not yet come; for you
any time is right.
7The world cannot hate you, but it hates
me because I testify that what it does is
evil.
8You go to the Feast. I am not yet going
up to this Feast, because for me the
right time has not yet come."
9Having said this, he stayed in Galilee.
10However, after his brothers had left for
the Feast, he went also, not publicly, but
in secret.
11Now at the Feast the Jews were
watching for him and asking, "Where is
that man?"
12Among the crowds there was
widespread whispering about him.
Some said, "He is a good man."
13Others replied, "No, he deceives the
people." But no one would say anything
publicly about him for fear of the Jews.
14Not until halfway through the Feast did
Jesus go up to the temple courts and
begin to teach.
15The Jews were amazed and asked,
"How did this man get such learning
without having studied?"
16Jesus answered, "My teaching is not
my own. It comes from him who sent me.
17If anyone chooses to do God's will, he
will find out whether my teaching comes
from God or whether I speak on my own.
18He who speaks on his own does so to
gain honor for himself, but he who works
for the honor of the one who sent him is
a man of truth; there is nothing false
about him.
19Has not Moses given you the law? Yet
not one of you keeps the law. Why are
you trying to kill me?"
20"You are demon-possessed," the
crowd answered. "Who is trying to kill
you?"
21Jesus said to them, "I did one miracle,
and you are all astonished.
22Yet, because Moses gave you
circumcision (though actually it did not
come from Moses, but from the
patriarchs), you circumcise a child on
the Sabbath.
23Now if a child can be circumcised on
the Sabbath so that the law of Moses
may not be broken, why are you angry
with me for healing the whole man on
the Sabbath?
24Stop judging by mere appearances,
and make a right judgment."
25At that point some of the people of
Jerusalem began to ask, "Isn't this the
man they are trying to kill?
26Here he is, speaking publicly, and they
are not saying a word to him. Have the
authorities really concluded that he is
the Christ ?
27But we know where this man is from;
when the Christ comes, no one will
know where he is from."
28Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple
courts, cried out, "Yes, you know me,
and you know where I am from. I am not
here on my own, but he who sent me is
true. You do not know him,
29but I know him because I am from him
and he sent me."
30At this they tried to seize him, but no
one laid a hand on him, because his
time had not yet come.
31Still, many in the crowd put their faith
in him. They said, "When the Christ
comes, will he do more miraculous signs
than this man?"
32The Pharisees heard the crowd
whispering such things about him. Then
the chief priests and the Pharisees sent
temple guards to arrest him.
33Jesus said, "I am with you for only a
short time, and then I go to the one who
sent me.
34You will look for me, but you will not
find me; and where I am, you cannot
come."
35The Jews said to one another, "Where
does this man intend to go that we
cannot find him? Will he go where our
people live scattered among the Greeks,
and teach the Greeks?
36What did he mean when he said, 'You
will look for me, but you will not find me,'
and 'Where I am, you cannot come'?"
37On the last and greatest day of the
Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud
voice, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come
to me and drink.
38Whoever believes in me, as the
Scripture has said, streams of living
water will flow from within him."
39By this he meant the Spirit, whom
those who believed in him were later to
receive. Up to that time the Spirit had
not been given, since Jesus had not yet
been glorified.
40On hearing his words, some of the
people said, "Surely this man is the
Prophet."
41Others said, "He is the Christ."
42Still others asked, "How can the Christ
come from Galilee? Does not the
Scripture say that the Christ will come
from David's family and from Bethlehem,
the town where David lived?"
43Thus the people were divided because
of Jesus.
44Some wanted to seize him, but no one
laid a hand on him.
45Finally the temple guards went back to
the chief priests and Pharisees, who
asked them, "Why didn't you bring him
in?"
46"No one ever spoke the way this man
does," the guards declared.
47"You mean he has deceived you
also?" the Pharisees retorted.
48"Has any of the rulers or of the
Pharisees believed in him?
49No! But this mob that knows nothing of
the law--there is a curse on them."
50Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus
earlier and who was one of their own
number, asked,
51"Does our law condemn anyone
without first hearing him to find out what
he is doing?"
52They replied, "Are you from Galilee,
too? Look into it, and you will find that a
prophet does not come out of Galilee."
53Then each went to his own home.
8But Jesus went to the Mount of
Olives.
2At dawn he appeared again in the
temple courts, where all the people
gathered around him, and he sat down
to teach them.
3The teachers of the law and the
Pharisees brought in a woman caught in
adultery. They made her stand before
the group
4and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this
woman was caught in the act of adultery.
5In the Law Moses commanded us to
stone such women. Now what do you
say?"
6They were using this question as a trap,
in order to have a basis for accusing him.
7But Jesus bent down and started to
write on the ground with his finger.
When they kept on questioning him, he
straightened up and said to them, "If any
one of you is without sin, let him be the
first to throw a stone at her."
8Again he stooped down and wrote on
the ground.
9At this, those who heard began to go
away one at a time, the older ones first,
until only Jesus was left, with the
woman still standing there.
10Jesus straightened up and asked her,
"Woman, where are they? Has no one
condemned you?"
11"No one, sir," she said. "Then neither
do I condemn you," Jesus declared. "Go
now and leave your life of sin."
12When Jesus spoke again to the people,
he said, "I am the light of the world.
Whoever follows me will never walk in
darkness, but will have the light of life."
13The Pharisees challenged him, "Here
you are, appearing as your own witness;
your testimony is not valid."
14Jesus answered, "Even if I testify on
my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for
I know where I came from and where I
am going. But you have no idea where I
come from or where I am going.
15You judge by human standards; I pass
judgment on no one.
16But if I do judge, my decisions are right,
because I am not alone. I stand with the
Father, who sent me.
17In your own Law it is written that the
testimony of two men is valid.
18I am one who testifies for myself; my
other witness is the Father, who sent
me."
19Then they asked him, "Where is your
father?"
20"You do not know me or my Father,"
Jesus replied. "If you knew me, you
would know my Father also." He spoke
these words while teaching in the
temple area near the place where the
offerings were put. Yet no one seized
him, because his time had not yet come.
21Once more Jesus said to them, "I am
going away, and you will look for me,
and you will die in your sin. Where I go,
you cannot come."
22This made the Jews ask, "Will he kill
himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I
go, you cannot come'?"
23But he continued, "You are from
below; I am from above. You are of this
world; I am not of this world.
24I told you that you would die in your
sins; if you do not believe that I am the
one I claim to be, you will indeed die in
your sins."
25"Who are you?" they asked.
26"Just what I have been claiming all
along," Jesus replied. "I have much to
say in judgment of you. But he who sent
me is reliable, and what I have heard
from him I tell the world."
27They did not understand that he was
telling them about his Father.
28So Jesus said, "When you have lifted
up the Son of Man, then you will know
that I am the one I claim to be and that I
do nothing on my own but speak just
what the Father has taught me.
29The one who sent me is with me; he
has not left me alone, for I always do
what pleases him."
30Even as he spoke, many put their faith
in him.
31To the Jews who had believed him,
Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching,
you are really my disciples.
32Then you will know the truth, and the
truth will set you free."
33They answered him, "We are
Abraham's descendants and have never
been slaves of anyone. How can you
say that we shall be set free?"
34Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth,
everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
35Now a slave has no permanent place
in the family, but a son belongs to it
forever.
36So if the Son sets you free, you will be
free indeed.
37I know you are Abraham's
descendants. Yet you are ready to kill
me, because you have no room for my
word.
38I am telling you what I have seen in
the Father's presence, and you do what
you have heard from your father. "
39"Abraham is our father," they
answered. "If you were Abraham's
children," said Jesus, "then you would
40do the things Abraham did. As it is,
you are determined to kill me, a man
who has told you the truth that I heard
from God. Abraham did not do such
things.
41You are doing the things your own
father does." "We are not illegitimate
children," they protested. "The only
Father we have is God himself."
42Jesus said to them, "If God were your
Father, you would love me, for I came
from God and now am here. I have not
come on my own; but he sent me.
43Why is my language not clear to you?
Because you are unable to hear what I
say.
44You belong to your father, the devil,
and you want to carry out your father's
desire. He was a murderer from the
beginning, not holding to the truth, for
there is no truth in him. When he lies, he
speaks his native language, for he is a
liar and the father of lies.
45Yet because I tell the truth, you do not
believe me!
46Can any of you prove me guilty of sin?
If I am telling the truth, why don't you
believe me?
47He who belongs to God hears what
God says. The reason you do not hear
is that you do not belong to God."
48The Jews answered him, "Aren't we
right in saying that you are a Samaritan
and demon-possessed?"
49"I am not possessed by a demon," said
Jesus, "but I honor my Father and you
dishonor me.
50I am not seeking glory for myself; but
there is one who seeks it, and he is the
judge.
51I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my
word, he will never see death."
52At this the Jews exclaimed, "Now we
know that you are demon-possessed!
Abraham died and so did the prophets,
yet you say that if anyone keeps your
word, he will never taste death.
53Are you greater than our father
Abraham? He died, and so did the
prophets. Who do you think you are?"
54Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my
glory means nothing. My Father, whom
you claim as your God, is the one who
glorifies me.
55Though you do not know him, I know
him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar
like you, but I do know him and keep his
word.
56Your father Abraham rejoiced at the
thought of seeing my day; he saw it and
was glad."
57"You are not yet fifty years old," the
Jews said to him, "and you have seen
Abraham!"
58"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered,
"before Abraham was born, I am!"
59At this, they picked up stones to stone
him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping
away from the temple grounds.
9As he went along, he saw a man
blind from birth.
2His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who
sinned, this man or his parents, that he
was born blind?"
3"Neither this man nor his parents
sinned," said Jesus, "but this happened
so that the work of God might be
displayed in his life.
4As long as it is day, we must do the
work of him who sent me. Night is
coming, when no one can work.
5While I am in the world, I am the light of
the world."
6Having said this, he spit on the ground,
made some mud with the saliva, and put
it on the man's eyes.
7"Go," he told him, "wash in the Pool of
Siloam" (this word means Sent). So the
man went and washed, and came home
seeing.
8His neighbors and those who had
formerly seen him begging asked, "Isn't
this the same man who used to sit and
beg?"
9Some claimed that he was. Others said,
"No, he only looks like him." But he
himself insisted, "I am the man."
10"How then were your eyes opened?"
they demanded.
11He replied, "The man they call Jesus
made some mud and put it on my eyes.
He told me to go to Siloam and wash.
So I went and washed, and then I could
see."
12"Where is this man?" they asked him.
"I don't know," he said.
13They brought to the Pharisees the
man who had been blind.
14Now the day on which Jesus had
made the mud and opened the man's
eyes was a Sabbath.
15Therefore the Pharisees also asked
him how he had received his sight. "He
put mud on my eyes," the man replied,
"and I washed, and now I see."
16Some of the Pharisees said, "This man
is not from God, for he does not keep
the Sabbath." But others asked, "How
can a sinner do such miraculous signs?"
So they were divided.
17Finally they turned again to the blind
man, "What have you to say about him?
It was your eyes he opened." The man
replied, "He is a prophet."
18The Jews still did not believe that he
had been blind and had received his
sight until they sent for the man's
parents.
19"Is this your son?" they asked. "Is this
the one you say was born blind? How is
it that now he can see?"
20"We know he is our son," the parents
answered, "and we know he was born
blind.
21But how he can see now, or who
opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask
him. He is of age; he will speak for
himself."
22His parents said this because they
were afraid of the Jews, for already the
Jews had decided that anyone who
acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ
would be put out of the synagogue.
23That was why his parents said, "He is
of age; ask him."
24A second time they summoned the
man who had been blind. "Give glory to
God, " they said. "We know this man is a
sinner."
25He replied, "Whether he is a sinner or
not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I
was blind but now I see!"
26Then they asked him, "What did he do
to you? How did he open your eyes?"
27He answered, "I have told you already
and you did not listen. Why do you want
to hear it again? Do you want to become
his disciples, too?"
28Then they hurled insults at him and
said, "You are this fellow's disciple! We
are disciples of Moses!
29We know that God spoke to Moses,
but as for this fellow, we don't even
know where he comes from."
30The man answered, "Now that is
remarkable! You don't know where he
comes from, yet he opened my eyes.
31We know that God does not listen to
sinners. He listens to the godly man who
does his will.
32Nobody has ever heard of opening the
eyes of a man born blind.
33If this man were not from God, he
could do nothing."
34To this they replied, "You were
steeped in sin at birth; how dare you
lecture us!" And they threw him out.
35Jesus heard that they had thrown him
out, and when he found him, he said,
"Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
36"Who is he, sir?" the man asked. "Tell
me so that I may believe in him."
37Jesus said, "You have now seen him;
in fact, he is the one speaking with you."
38Then the man said, "Lord, I believe,"
and he worshiped him.
39Jesus said, "For judgment I have come
into this world, so that the blind will see
and those who see will become blind."
40Some Pharisees who were with him
heard him say this and asked, "What?
Are we blind too?"
41Jesus said, "If you were blind, you
would not be guilty of sin; but now that
you claim you can see, your guilt
remains.
10"I tell you the truth, the man who
does not enter the sheep pen by the
gate, but climbs in by some other way,
is a thief and a robber.
2The man who enters by the gate is the
shepherd of his sheep.
3The watchman opens the gate for him,
and the sheep listen to his voice. He
calls his own sheep by name and leads
them out.
4When he has brought out all his own,
he goes on ahead of them, and his
sheep follow him because they know his
voice.
5But they will never follow a stranger; in
fact, they will run away from him
because they do not recognize a
strangers voice."
6Jesus used this figure of speech, but
they did not understand what he was
telling them.
7Therefore Jesus said again, "I tell you
the truth, I am the gate for the sheep.
8All who ever came before me were
thieves and robbers, but the sheep did
not listen to them.
9I am the gate; whoever enters through
me will be saved. He will come in and
go out, and find pasture.
10The thief comes only to steal and kill
and destroy; I have come that they may
have life, and have it to the full.
11"I am the good shepherd. The good
shepherd lays down his life for the
sheep.
12The hired hand is not the shepherd
who owns the sheep. So when he sees
the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep
and runs away. Then the wolf attacks
the flock and scatters it.
13The man runs away because he is a
hired hand and cares nothing for the
sheep.
14"I am the good shepherd; I know my
sheep and my sheep know me--
15just as the Father knows me and I
know the Father--and I lay down my life
for the sheep.
16I have other sheep that are not of this
sheep pen. I must bring them also. They
too will listen to my voice, and there
shall be one flock and one shepherd.
17The reason my Father loves me is that
I lay down my life--only to take it up
again.
18No one takes it from me, but I lay it
down of my own accord. I have authority
to lay it down and authority to take it up
again. This command I received from
my Father."
19At these words the Jews were again
divided.
20Many of them said, "He is demonpossessed
and raving mad. Why listen
to him?"
21But others said, "These are not the
sayings of a man possessed by a
demon. Can a demon open the eyes of
the blind?"
22Then came the Feast of Dedication at
Jerusalem. It was winter,
23and Jesus was in the temple area
walking in Solomon's Colonnade.
24The Jews gathered around him, saying,
"How long will you keep us in
suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us
plainly."
25Jesus answered, "I did tell you, but
you do not believe. The miracles I do in
my Father's name speak for me,
26but you do not believe because you
are not my sheep.
27My sheep listen to my voice; I know
them, and they follow me.
28I give them eternal life, and they shall
never perish; no one can snatch them
out of my hand.
29My Father, who has given them to me,
is greater than all ; no one can snatch
them out of my Father's hand.
30I and the Father are one."
31Again the Jews picked up stones to
stone him,
32but Jesus said to them, "I have shown
you many great miracles from the
Father. For which of these do you stone
me?"
33"We are not stoning you for any of
these," replied the Jews, "but for
blasphemy, because you, a mere man,
claim to be God."
34Jesus answered them, "Is it not written
in your Law, 'I have said you are gods' ?
35If he called them 'gods,' to whom the
word of God came--and the Scripture
cannot be broken--
36what about the one whom the Father
set apart as his very own and sent into
the world? Why then do you accuse me
of blasphemy because I said, 'I am
God's Son'?
37Do not believe me unless I do what my
Father does.
38But if I do it, even though you do not
believe me, believe the miracles, that
you may know and understand that the
Father is in me, and I in the Father."
39Again they tried to seize him, but he
escaped their grasp.
40Then Jesus went back across the
Jordan to the place where John had
been baptizing in the early days. Here
he stayed
41and many people came to him. They
said, "Though John never performed a
miraculous sign, all that John said about
this man was true."
42And in that place many believed in
Jesus.
11Now a man named Lazarus was
sick. He was from Bethany, the village
of Mary and her sister Martha.
2This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now
lay sick, was the same one who poured
perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet
with her hair.
3So the sisters sent word to Jesus, "Lord,
the one you love is sick."
4When he heard this, Jesus said, "This
sickness will not end in death. No, it is
for God's glory so that God's Son may
be glorified through it."
5Jesus loved Martha and her sister and
Lazarus.
6Yet when he heard that Lazarus was
sick, he stayed where he was two more
days.
7Then he said to his disciples, "Let us go
back to Judea."
8"But Rabbi," they said, "a short while
ago the Jews tried to stone you, and yet
you are going back there?"
9Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve
hours of daylight? A man who walks by
day will not stumble, for he sees by this
world's light.
10It is when he walks by night that he
stumbles, for he has no light."
11After he had said this, he went on to
tell them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen
asleep; but I am going there to wake
him up."
12His disciples replied, "Lord, if he
sleeps, he will get better."
13Jesus had been speaking of his death,
but his disciples thought he meant
natural sleep.
14So then he told them plainly, "Lazarus
is dead,
15and for your sake I am glad I was not
there, so that you may believe. But let
us go to him."
16Then Thomas (called Didymus) said to
the rest of the disciples, "Let us also go,
that we may die with him."
17On his arrival, Jesus found that
Lazarus had already been in the tomb
for four days.
18Bethany was less than two miles from
Jerusalem,
19and many Jews had come to Martha
and Mary to comfort them in the loss of
their brother.
20When Martha heard that Jesus was
coming, she went out to meet him, but
Mary stayed at home.
21"Lord," Martha said to Jesus, "if you
had been here, my brother would not
have died.
22But I know that even now God will give
you whatever you ask."
23Jesus said to her, "Your brother will
rise again."
24Martha answered, "I know he will rise
again in the resurrection at the last day."
25Jesus said to her, "I am the
resurrection and the life. He who
believes in me will live, even though he
dies;
26and whoever lives and believes in me
will never die. Do you believe this?"
27"Yes, Lord," she told him, "I believe
that you are the Christ, the Son of God,
who was to come into the world."
28And after she had said this, she went
back and called her sister Mary aside.
"The Teacher is here," she said, "and is
asking for you."
29When Mary heard this, she got up
quickly and went to him.
30Now Jesus had not yet entered the
village, but was still at the place where
Martha had met him.
31When the Jews who had been with
Mary in the house, comforting her,
noticed how quickly she got up and went
out, they followed her, supposing she
was going to the tomb to mourn there.
32When Mary reached the place where
Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his
feet and said, "Lord, if you had been
here, my brother would not have died."
33When Jesus saw her weeping, and the
Jews who had come along with her also
weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit
and troubled.
34"Where have you laid him?" he asked.
"Come and see, Lord," they replied.
35Jesus wept.
36Then the Jews said, "See how he
loved him!"
37But some of them said, "Could not he
who opened the eyes of the blind man
have kept this man from dying?"
38Jesus, once more deeply moved,
came to the tomb. It was a cave with a
stone laid across the entrance.
39"Take away the stone," he said. "But,
Lord," said Martha, the sister of the
dead man, "by this time there is a bad
odor, for he has been there four days."
40Then Jesus said, "Did I not tell you
that if you believed, you would see the
glory of God?"
41So they took away the stone. Then
Jesus looked up and said, "Father, I
thank you that you have heard me.
42I knew that you always hear me, but I
said this for the benefit of the people
standing here, that they may believe
that you sent me."
43When he had said this, Jesus called in
a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
44The dead man came out, his hands
and feet wrapped with strips of linen,
and a cloth around his face. Jesus said
to them, "Take off the grave clothes and
let him go."
45Therefore many of the Jews who had
come to visit Mary, and had seen what
Jesus did, put their faith in him.
46But some of them went to the
Pharisees and told them what Jesus
had done.
47Then the chief priests and the
Pharisees called a meeting of the
Sanhedrin.
48"What are we accomplishing?" they
asked. "Here is this man performing
many miraculous signs. If we let him go
on like this, everyone will believe in him,
and then the Romans will come and
take away both our place and our
nation."
49Then one of them, named Caiaphas,
who was high priest that year, spoke up,
"You know nothing at all!
50You do not realize that it is better for
you that one man die for the people than
that the whole nation perish."
51He did not say this on his own, but as
high priest that year he prophesied that
Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,
52and not only for that nation but also for
the scattered children of God, to bring
them together and make them one.
53So from that day on they plotted to
take his life.
54Therefore Jesus no longer moved
about publicly among the Jews. Instead
he withdrew to a region near the desert,
to a village called Ephraim, where he
stayed with his disciples.
55When it was almost time for the
Jewish Passover, many went up from
the country to Jerusalem for their
ceremonial cleansing before the
Passover.
56They kept looking for Jesus, and as
they stood in the temple area they
asked one another, "What do you think?
Isn't he coming to the Feast at all?"
57But the chief priests and Pharisees
had given orders that if anyone found
out where Jesus was, he should report it
so that they might arrest him.
12Six days before the Passover,
Jesus arrived at Bethany, where
Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised
from the dead.
2Here a dinner was given in Jesus'
honor. Martha served, while Lazarus
was among those reclining at the table
with him.
3Then Mary took about a pint of pure
nard, an expensive perfume; she poured
it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with
her hair. And the house was filled with
the fragrance of the perfume.
4But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot,
who was later to betray him, objected,
5"Why wasn't this perfume sold and the
money given to the poor? It was worth a
year's wages. "
6He did not say this because he cared
about the poor but because he was a
thief; as keeper of the money bag, he
used to help himself to what was put
into it.
7"Leave her alone," Jesus replied. "It
was intended that she should save this
perfume for the day of my burial.
8You will always have the poor among
you, but you will not always have me."
9Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found
out that Jesus was there and came, not
only because of him but also to see
Lazarus, whom he had raised from the
dead.
10So the chief priests made plans to kill
Lazarus as well,
11for on account of him many of the
Jews were going over to Jesus and
putting their faith in him.
12The next day the great crowd that had
come for the Feast heard that Jesus
was on his way to Jerusalem.
13They took palm branches and went out
to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! "
"Blessed is he who comes in the name
of the Lord!" "Blessed is the King of
Israel!"
14Jesus found a young donkey and sat
upon it, as it is written,
15"Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion;
see, your king is coming, seated on a
donkey's colt."
16At first his disciples did not understand
all this. Only after Jesus was glorified
did they realize that these things had
been written about him and that they
had done these things to him.
17Now the crowd that was with him when
he called Lazarus from the tomb and
raised him from the dead continued to
spread the word.
18Many people, because they had heard
that he had given this miraculous sign,
went out to meet him.
19So the Pharisees said to one another,
"See, this is getting us nowhere. Look
how the whole world has gone after
him!"
20Now there were some Greeks among
those who went up to worship at the
Feast.
21They came to Philip, who was from
Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request.
"Sir," they said, "we would like to see
Jesus."
22Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and
Philip in turn told Jesus.
23Jesus replied, "The hour has come for
the Son of Man to be glorified.
24I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of
wheat falls to the ground and dies, it
remains only a single seed. But if it dies,
it produces many seeds.
25The man who loves his life will lose it,
while the man who hates his life in this
world will keep it for eternal life.
26Whoever serves me must follow me;
and where I am, my servant also will be.
My Father will honor the one who serves
me.
27"Now my heart is troubled, and what
shall I say? 'Father, save me from this
hour'? No, it was for this very reason I
came to this hour.
28Father, glorify your name!"
29Then a voice came from heaven, "I
have glorified it, and will glorify it again."
The crowd that was there and heard it
said it had thundered; others said an
angel had spoken to him.
30Jesus said, "This voice was for your
benefit, not mine.
31Now is the time for judgment on this
world; now the prince of this world will
be driven out.
32But I, when I am lifted up from the
earth, will draw all men to myself."
33He said this to show the kind of death
he was going to die.
34The crowd spoke up, "We have heard
from the Law that the Christ will remain
forever, so how can you say, 'The Son
of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this
'Son of Man'?"
35Then Jesus told them, "You are going
to have the light just a little while longer.
Walk while you have the light, before
darkness overtakes you. The man who
walks in the dark does not know where
he is going.
36Put your trust in the light while you
have it, so that you may become sons of
light." When he had finished speaking,
Jesus left and hid himself from them.
37Even after Jesus had done all these
miraculous signs in their presence, they
still would not believe in him.
38This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the
prophet: "Lord, who has believed our
message and to whom has the arm of
the Lord been revealed?"
39For this reason they could not believe,
because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:
40"He has blinded their eyes and
deadened their hearts, so they can
neither see with their eyes, nor
understand with their hearts, nor turn--
and I would heal them."
41Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus'
glory and spoke about him.
42Yet at the same time many even
among the leaders believed in him. But
because of the Pharisees they would
not confess their faith for fear they
would be put out of the synagogue;
43for they loved praise from men more
than praise from God.
44Then Jesus cried out, "When a man
believes in me, he does not believe in
me only, but in the one who sent me.
45When he looks at me, he sees the one
who sent me.
46I have come into the world as a light,
so that no one who believes in me
should stay in darkness.
47"As for the person who hears my
words but does not keep them, I do not
judge him. For I did not come to judge
the world, but to save it.
48There is a judge for the one who
rejects me and does not accept my
words; that very word which I spoke will
condemn him at the last day.
49For I did not speak of my own accord,
but the Father who sent me commanded
me what to say and how to say it.
50I know that his command leads to
eternal life. So whatever I say is just
what the Father has told me to say."
13It was just before the Passover
Feast. Jesus knew that the time had
come for him to leave this world and go
to the Father. Having loved his own who
were in the world, he now showed them
the full extent of his love.
2The evening meal was being served,
and the devil had already prompted
Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray
Jesus.
3Jesus knew that the Father had put all
things under his power, and that he had
come from God and was returning to
God;
4so he got up from the meal, took off his
outer clothing, and wrapped a towel
around his waist.
5After that, he poured water into a basin
and began to wash his disciples' feet,
drying them with the towel that was
wrapped around him.
6He came to Simon Peter, who said to
him, "Lord, are you going to wash my
feet?"
7Jesus replied, "You do not realize now
what I am doing, but later you will
understand."
8"No," said Peter, "you shall never wash
my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I
wash you, you have no part with me."
9"Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not
just my feet but my hands and my head
as well!"
10Jesus answered, "A person who has
had a bath needs only to wash his feet;
his whole body is clean. And you are
clean, though not every one of you."
11For he knew who was going to betray
him, and that was why he said not every
one was clean.
12When he had finished washing their
feet, he put on his clothes and returned
to his place. "Do you understand what I
have done for you?" he asked them.
13"You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and
rightly so, for that is what I am.
14Now that I, your Lord and Teacher,
have washed your feet, you also should
wash one another's feet.
15I have set you an example that you
should do as I have done for you.
16I tell you the truth, no servant is
greater than his master, nor is a
messenger greater than the one who
sent him.
17Now that you know these things, you
will be blessed if you do them.
18"I am not referring to all of you; I know
those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill
the scripture: 'He who shares my bread
has lifted up his heel against me.'
19"I am telling you now before it happens,
so that when it does happen you will
believe that I am He.
20I tell you the truth, whoever accepts
anyone I send accepts me; and whoever
accepts me accepts the one who sent
me."
21After he had said this, Jesus was
troubled in spirit and testified, "I tell you
the truth, one of you is going to betray
me."
22His disciples stared at one another, at
a loss to know which of them he meant.
23One of them, the disciple whom Jesus
loved, was reclining next to him.
24Simon Peter motioned to this disciple
and said, "Ask him which one he
means."
25Leaning back against Jesus, he asked
him, "Lord, who is it?"
26Jesus answered, "It is the one to
whom I will give this piece of bread
when I have dipped it in the dish." Then,
dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to
Judas Iscariot, son of Simon.
27As soon as Judas took the bread,
Satan entered into him.
28"What you are about to do, do quickly,"
Jesus told him, but no one at the meal
understood why Jesus said this to him.
29Since Judas had charge of the money,
some thought Jesus was telling him to
buy what was needed for the Feast, or
to give something to the poor.
30As soon as Judas had taken the bread,
he went out. And it was night.
31When he was gone, Jesus said, "Now
is the Son of Man glorified and God is
glorified in him.
32If God is glorified in him, God will
glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify
him at once.
33"My children, I will be with you only a
little longer. You will look for me, and
just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now:
Where I am going, you cannot come.
34"A new command I give you: Love one
another. As I have loved you, so you
must love one another.
35By this all men will know that you are
my disciples, if you love one another."
36Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where
are you going?" Jesus replied, "Where I
am going, you cannot follow now, but
you will follow later."
37Peter asked, "Lord, why can't I follow
you now? I will lay down my life for you."
38Then Jesus answered, "Will you really
lay down your life for me? I tell you the
truth, before the rooster crows, you will
disown me three times!
14"Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Trust in God ; trust also in me.
2In my Father's house are many rooms;
if it were not so, I would have told you. I
am going there to prepare a place for
you.
3And if I go and prepare a place for you,
I will come back and take you to be with
me that you also may be where I am.
4You know the way to the place where I
am going."
5Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't
know where you are going, so how can
we know the way?"
6Jesus answered, "I am the way and the
truth and the life. No one comes to the
Father except through me.
7If you really knew me, you would know
my Father as well. From now on, you do
know him and have seen him."
8Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father
and that will be enough for us."
9Jesus answered: "Don't you know me,
Philip, even after I have been among
you such a long time? Anyone who has
seen me has seen the Father. How can
you say, 'Show us the Father'?
10Don't you believe that I am in the
Father, and that the Father is in me?
The words I say to you are not just my
own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me,
who is doing his work.
11Believe me when I say that I am in the
Father and the Father is in me; or at
least believe on the evidence of the
miracles themselves.
12I tell you the truth, anyone who has
faith in me will do what I have been
doing. He will do even greater things
than these, because I am going to the
Father.
13And I will do whatever you ask in my
name, so that the Son may bring glory
to the Father.
14You may ask me for anything in my
name, and I will do it.
15"If you love me, you will obey what I
command.
16And I will ask the Father, and he will
give you another Counselor to be with
you forever--
17the Spirit of truth. The world cannot
accept him, because it neither sees him
nor knows him. But you know him, for
he lives with you and will be in you.
18I will not leave you as orphans; I will
come to you.
19Before long, the world will not see me
anymore, but you will see me. Because I
live, you also will live.
20On that day you will realize that I am in
my Father, and you are in me, and I am
in you.
21Whoever has my commands and
obeys them, he is the one who loves me.
He who loves me will be loved by my
Father, and I too will love him and show
myself to him."
22Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said,
"But, Lord, why do you intend to show
yourself to us and not to the world?"
23Jesus replied, "If anyone loves me, he
will obey my teaching. My Father will
love him, and we will come to him and
make our home with him.
24He who does not love me will not obey
my teaching. These words you hear are
not my own; they belong to the Father
who sent me.
25"All this I have spoken while still with
you.
26But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit,
whom the Father will send in my name,
will teach you all things and will remind
you of everything I have said to you.
27Peace I leave with you; my peace I
give you. I do not give to you as the
world gives. Do not let your hearts be
troubled and do not be afraid.
28"You heard me say, 'I am going away
and I am coming back to you.' If you
loved me, you would be glad that I am
going to the Father, for the Father is
greater than I.
29I have told you now before it happens,
so that when it does happen you will
believe.
30I will not speak with you much longer,
for the prince of this world is coming. He
has no hold on me,
31but the world must learn that I love the
Father and that I do exactly what my
Father has commanded me. "Come
now; let us leave.
15"I am the true vine, and my Father
is the gardener.
2He cuts off every branch in me that
bears no fruit, while every branch that
does bear fruit he prunes so that it will
be even more fruitful.
3You are already clean because of the
word I have spoken to you.
4Remain in me, and I will remain in you.
No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must
remain in the vine. Neither can you bear
fruit unless you remain in me.
5"I am the vine; you are the branches. If
a man remains in me and I in him, he
will bear much fruit; apart from me you
can do nothing.
6If anyone does not remain in me, he is
like a branch that is thrown away and
withers; such branches are picked up,
thrown into the fire and burned.
7If you remain in me and my words
remain in you, ask whatever you wish,
and it will be given you.
8This is to my Father's glory, that you
bear much fruit, showing yourselves to
be my disciples.
9"As the Father has loved me, so have I
loved you. Now remain in my love.
10If you obey my commands, you will
remain in my love, just as I have obeyed
my Father's commands and remain in
his love.
11I have told you this so that my joy may
be in you and that your joy may be
complete.
12My command is this: Love each other
as I have loved you.
13Greater love has no one than this, that
he lay down his life for his friends.
14You are my friends if you do what I
command.
15I no longer call you servants, because
a servant does not know his master's
business. Instead, I have called you
friends, for everything that I learned
from my Father I have made known to
you.
16You did not choose me, but I chose
you and appointed you to go and bear
fruit--fruit that will last. Then the Father
will give you whatever you ask in my
name.
17This is my command: Love each other.
18"If the world hates you, keep in mind
that it hated me first.
19If you belonged to the world, it would
love you as its own. As it is, you do not
belong to the world, but I have chosen
you out of the world. That is why the
world hates you.
20Remember the words I spoke to you:
'No servant is greater than his master.' If
they persecuted me, they will persecute
you also. If they obeyed my teaching,
they will obey yours also.
21They will treat you this way because of
my name, for they do not know the One
who sent me.
22If I had not come and spoken to them,
they would not be guilty of sin. Now,
however, they have no excuse for their
sin.
23He who hates me hates my Father as
well.
24If I had not done among them what no
one else did, they would not be guilty of
sin. But now they have seen these
miracles, and yet they have hated both
me and my Father.
25But this is to fulfill what is written in
their Law: 'They hated me without
reason.'
26"When the Counselor comes, whom I
will send to you from the Father, the
Spirit of truth who goes out from the
Father, he will testify about me.
27And you also must testify, for you have
been with me from the beginning.
16"All this I have told you so that you
will not go astray.
2They will put you out of the synagogue;
in fact, a time is coming when anyone
who kills you will think he is offering a
service to God.
3They will do such things because they
have not known the Father or me.
4I have told you this, so that when the
time comes you will remember that I
warned you. I did not tell you this at first
because I was with you.
5"Now I am going to him who sent me,
yet none of you asks me, 'Where are
you going?'
6Because I have said these things, you
are filled with grief.
7But I tell you the truth: It is for your
good that I am going away. Unless I go
away, the Counselor will not come to
you; but if I go, I will send him to you.
8When he comes, he will convict the
world of guilt in regard to sin and
righteousness and judgment:
9in regard to sin, because men do not
believe in me;
10in regard to righteousness, because I
am going to the Father, where you can
see me no longer;
11and in regard to judgment, because
the prince of this world now stands
condemned.
12"I have much more to say to you, more
than you can now bear.
13But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes,
he will guide you into all truth. He will
not speak on his own; he will speak only
what he hears, and he will tell you what
is yet to come.
14He will bring glory to me by taking from
what is mine and making it known to you.
15All that belongs to the Father is mine.
That is why I said the Spirit will take
from what is mine and make it known to
you.
16"In a little while you will see me no
more, and then after a little while you
will see me."
17Some of his disciples said to one
another, "What does he mean by saying,
'In a little while you will see me no more,
and then after a little while you will see
me,' and 'Because I am going to the
Father'?"
18They kept asking, "What does he
mean by 'a little while'? We don't
understand what he is saying."
19Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him
about this, so he said to them, "Are you
asking one another what I meant when I
said, 'In a little while you will see me no
more, and then after a little while you
will see me'?
20I tell you the truth, you will weep and
mourn while the world rejoices. You will
grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.
21A woman giving birth to a child has
pain because her time has come; but
when her baby is born she forgets the
anguish because of her joy that a child
is born into the world.
22So with you: Now is your time of grief,
but I will see you again and you will
rejoice, and no one will take away your
joy.
23In that day you will no longer ask me
anything. I tell you the truth, my Father
will give you whatever you ask in my
name.
24Until now you have not asked for
anything in my name. Ask and you will
receive, and your joy will be complete.
25"Though I have been speaking
figuratively, a time is coming when I will
no longer use this kind of language but
will tell you plainly about my Father.
26In that day you will ask in my name. I
am not saying that I will ask the Father
on your behalf.
27No, the Father himself loves you
because you have loved me and have
believed that I came from God.
28I came from the Father and entered
the world; now I am leaving the world
and going back to the Father."
29Then Jesus' disciples said, "Now you
are speaking clearly and without figures
of speech.
30Now we can see that you know all
things and that you do not even need to
have anyone ask you questions. This
makes us believe that you came from
God."
31"You believe at last!" Jesus answered.
32"But a time is coming, and has come,
when you will be scattered, each to his
own home. You will leave me all alone.
Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with
me.
33"I have told you these things, so that in
me you may have peace. In this world
you will have trouble. But take heart! I
have overcome the world."
17After Jesus said this, he looked
toward heaven and prayed:
2"Father, the time has come. Glorify
your Son, that your Son may glorify you.
For you granted him authority over all
people that he might give eternal life to
all those you have given him.
3Now this is eternal life: that they may
know you, the only true God, and Jesus
Christ, whom you have sent.
4I have brought you glory on earth by
completing the work you gave me to do.
5And now, Father, glorify me in your
presence with the glory I had with you
before the world began.
6"I have revealed you to those whom
you gave me out of the world. They
were yours; you gave them to me and
they have obeyed your word.
7Now they know that everything you
have given me comes from you.
8For I gave them the words you gave me
and they accepted them. They knew
with certainty that I came from you, and
they believed that you sent me.
9I pray for them. I am not praying for the
world, but for those you have given me,
for they are yours.
10All I have is yours, and all you have is
mine. And glory has come to me
through them.
11I will remain in the world no longer, but
they are still in the world, and I am
coming to you. Holy Father, protect
them by the power of your name--the
name you gave me--so that they may be
one as we are one.
12While I was with them, I protected
them and kept them safe by that name
you gave me. None has been lost
except the one doomed to destruction
so that Scripture would be fulfilled.
13"I am coming to you now, but I say
these things while I am still in the world,
so that they may have the full measure
of my joy within them.
14I have given them your word and the
world has hated them, for they are not of
the world any more than I am of the
world.
15My prayer is not that you take them
out of the world but that you protect
them from the evil one.
16They are not of the world, even as I
am not of it.
17Sanctify them by the truth; your word
is truth.
18As you sent me into the world, I have
sent them into the world.
19For them I sanctify myself, that they
too may be truly sanctified.
20"My prayer is not for them alone. I pray
also for those who will believe in me
through their message,
21that all of them may be one, Father,
just as you are in me and I am in you.
May they also be in us so that the world
may believe that you have sent me.
22I have given them the glory that you
gave me, that they may be one as we
are one:
23I in them and you in me. May they be
brought to complete unity to let the
world know that you sent me and have
loved them even as you have loved me.
24"Father, I want those you have given
me to be with me where I am, and to
see my glory, the glory you have given
me because you loved me before the
creation of the world.
25"Righteous Father, though the world
does not know you, I know you, and
they know that you have sent me.
26I have made you known to them, and
will continue to make you known in
order that the love you have for me may
be in them and that I myself may be in
them."
18When he had finished praying,
Jesus left with his disciples and crossed
the Kidron Valley. On the other side
there was an olive grove, and he and his
disciples went into it.
2Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew
the place, because Jesus had often met
there with his disciples.
3So Judas came to the grove, guiding a
detachment of soldiers and some
officials from the chief priests and
Pharisees. They were carrying torches,
lanterns and weapons.
4Jesus, knowing all that was going to
happen to him, went out and asked
them, "Who is it you want?"
5"Jesus of Nazareth," they replied.
6"I am he," Jesus said. (And Judas the
traitor was standing there with them.)
When Jesus said, "I am he," they drew
back and fell to the ground.
7Again he asked them, "Who is it you
want?" And they said, "Jesus of
Nazareth."
8"I told you that I am he," Jesus
answered. "If you are looking for me,
then let these men go."
9This happened so that the words he
had spoken would be fulfilled: "I have
not lost one of those you gave me."
10Then Simon Peter, who had a sword,
drew it and struck the high priest's
servant, cutting off his right ear. (The
servant's name was Malchus.)
11Jesus commanded Peter, "Put your
sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the
Father has given me?"
12Then the detachment of soldiers with
its commander and the Jewish officials
arrested Jesus. They bound him
13and brought him first to Annas, who
was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the
high priest that year.
14Caiaphas was the one who had
advised the Jews that it would be good if
one man died for the people.
15Simon Peter and another disciple were
following Jesus. Because this disciple
was known to the high priest, he went
with Jesus into the high priest's
courtyard,
16but Peter had to wait outside at the
door. The other disciple, who was
known to the high priest, came back,
spoke to the girl on duty there and
brought Peter in.
17"You are not one of his disciples, are
you?" the girl at the door asked Peter.
He replied, "I am not."
18It was cold, and the servants and
officials stood around a fire they had
made to keep warm. Peter also was
standing with them, warming himself.
19Meanwhile, the high priest questioned
Jesus about his disciples and his
teaching.
20"I have spoken openly to the world,"
Jesus replied. "I always taught in
synagogues or at the temple, where all
the Jews come together. I said nothing
in secret.
21Why question me? Ask those who
heard me. Surely they know what I
said."
22When Jesus said this, one of the
officials nearby struck him in the face.
"Is this the way you answer the high
priest?" he demanded.
23"If I said something wrong," Jesus
replied, "testify as to what is wrong. But
if I spoke the truth, why did you strike
me?"
24Then Annas sent him, still bound, to
Caiaphas the high priest.
25As Simon Peter stood warming himself,
he was asked, "You are not one of his
disciples, are you?" He denied it, saying,
"I am not."
26One of the high priest's servants, a
relative of the man whose ear Peter had
cut off, challenged him, "Didn't I see you
with him in the olive grove?"
27Again Peter denied it, and at that
moment a rooster began to crow.
28Then the Jews led Jesus from
Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman
governor. By now it was early morning,
and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness
the Jews did not enter the palace; they
wanted to be able to eat the Passover.
29So Pilate came out to them and asked,
"What charges are you bringing against
this man?"
30"If he were not a criminal," they replied,
"we would not have handed him over to
you."
31Pilate said, "Take him yourselves and
judge him by your own law."
32"But we have no right to execute
anyone," the Jews objected. This
happened so that the words Jesus had
spoken indicating the kind of death he
was going to die would be fulfilled.
33Pilate then went back inside the
palace, summoned Jesus and asked
him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"
34"Is that your own idea," Jesus asked,
"or did others talk to you about me?"
35"Am I a Jew?" Pilate replied. "It was
your people and your chief priests who
handed you over to me. What is it you
have done?"
36Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this
world. If it were, my servants would fight
to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But
now my kingdom is from another place."
37"You are a king, then!" said Pilate.
Jesus answered, "You are right in
saying I am a king. In fact, for this
reason I was born, and for this I came
into the world, to testify to the truth.
Everyone on the side of truth listens to
me."
38"What is truth?" Pilate asked. With this
he went out again to the Jews and said,
"I find no basis for a charge against him.
39But it is your custom for me to release
to you one prisoner at the time of the
Passover. Do you want me to release
'the king of the Jews'?"
40They shouted back, "No, not him! Give
us Barabbas!" Now Barabbas had taken
part in a rebellion.
19Then Pilate took Jesus and had
him flogged.
2The soldiers twisted together a crown
of thorns and put it on his head. They
clothed him in a purple robe
3and went up to him again and again,
saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!" And
they struck him in the face.
4Once more Pilate came out and said to
the Jews, "Look, I am bringing him out
to you to let you know that I find no
basis for a charge against him."
5When Jesus came out wearing the
crown of thorns and the purple robe,
Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"
6As soon as the chief priests and their
officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify!
Crucify!" But Pilate answered, "You take
him and crucify him. As for me, I find no
basis for a charge against him."
7The Jews insisted, "We have a law,
and according to that law he must die,
because he claimed to be the Son of
God."
8When Pilate heard this, he was even
more afraid,
9and he went back inside the palace.
"Where do you come from?" he asked
Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.
10"Do you refuse to speak to me?" Pilate
said. "Don't you realize I have power
either to free you or to crucify you?"
11Jesus answered, "You would have no
power over me if it were not given to you
from above. Therefore the one who
handed me over to you is guilty of a
greater sin."
12From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus
free, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you
let this man go, you are no friend of
Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king
opposes Caesar."
13When Pilate heard this, he brought
Jesus out and sat down on the judge's
seat at a place known as the Stone
Pavement (which in Aramaic is
Gabbatha).
14It was the day of Preparation of
Passover Week, about the sixth hour.
"Here is your king," Pilate said to the
Jews.
15But they shouted, "Take him away!
Take him away! Crucify him!" "Shall I
crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We
have no king but Caesar," the chief
priests answered.
16Finally Pilate handed him over to them
to be crucified.
17So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.
Carrying his own cross, he went out to
the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic
is called Golgotha).
18Here they crucified him, and with him
two others--one on each side and Jesus
in the middle.
19Pilate had a notice prepared and
fastened to the cross. It read:
20Many of the Jews read this sign, for
the place where Jesus was crucified
was near the city, and the sign was
written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek.
21The chief priests of the Jews protested
to Pilate, "Do not write 'The King of the
Jews,' but that this man claimed to be
king of the Jews."
22Pilate answered, "What I have written,
I have written."
23When the soldiers crucified Jesus,
they took his clothes, dividing them into
four shares, one for each of them, with
the undergarment remaining. This
garment was seamless, woven in one
piece from top to bottom.
24"Let's not tear it," they said to one
another. "Let's decide by lot who will get
it." This happened that the scripture
might be fulfilled which said, "They
divided my garments among them and
cast lots for my clothing." So this is what
the soldiers did.
25Near the cross of Jesus stood his
mother, his mother's sister, Mary the
wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
26When Jesus saw his mother there,
and the disciple whom he loved
standing nearby, he said to his mother,
"Dear woman, here is your son,"
27and to the disciple, "Here is your
mother." From that time on, this disciple
took her into his home.
28Later, knowing that all was now
completed, and so that the Scripture
would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am
thirsty."
29A jar of wine vinegar was there, so
they soaked a sponge in it, put the
sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant,
and lifted it to Jesus' lips.
30When he had received the drink,
Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he
bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
31Now it was the day of Preparation, and
the next day was to be a special
Sabbath. Because the Jews did not
want the bodies left on the crosses
during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to
have the legs broken and the bodies
taken down.
32The soldiers therefore came and broke
the legs of the first man who had been
crucified with Jesus, and then those of
the other.
33But when they came to Jesus and
found that he was already dead, they
did not break his legs.
34Instead, one of the soldiers pierced
Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a
sudden flow of blood and water.
35The man who saw it has given
testimony, and his testimony is true. He
knows that he tells the truth, and he
testifies so that you also may believe.
36These things happened so that the
scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of
his bones will be broken,"
37and, as another scripture says, "They
will look on the one they have pierced."
38Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked
Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now
Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but
secretly because he feared the Jews.
With Pilate's permission, he came and
took the body away.
39He was accompanied by Nicodemus,
the man who earlier had visited Jesus at
night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of
myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five
pounds.
40Taking Jesus' body, the two of them
wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of
linen. This was in accordance with
Jewish burial customs.
41At the place where Jesus was crucified,
there was a garden, and in the garden a
new tomb, in which no one had ever
been laid.
42Because it was the Jewish day of
Preparation and since the tomb was
nearby, they laid Jesus there.
20Early on the first day of the week,
while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene
went to the tomb and saw that the stone
had been removed from the entrance.
2So she came running to Simon Peter
and the other disciple, the one Jesus
loved, and said, "They have taken the
Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know
where they have put him!"
3So Peter and the other disciple started
for the tomb.
4Both were running, but the other
disciple outran Peter and reached the
tomb first.
5He bent over and looked in at the strips
of linen lying there but did not go in.
6Then Simon Peter, who was behind
him, arrived and went into the tomb. He
saw the strips of linen lying there,
7as well as the burial cloth that had been
around Jesus' head. The cloth was
folded up by itself, separate from the
linen.
8Finally the other disciple, who had
reached the tomb first, also went inside.
He saw and believed.
9(They still did not understand from
Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the
dead.)
10Then the disciples went back to their
homes,
11but Mary stood outside the tomb crying.
As she wept, she bent over to look into
the tomb
12and saw two angels in white, seated
where Jesus' body had been, one at the
head and the other at the foot.
13They asked her, "Woman, why are you
crying?"
14"They have taken my Lord away," she
said, "and I don't know where they have
put him." At this, she turned around and
saw Jesus standing there, but she did
not realize that it was Jesus.
15"Woman," he said, "why are you
crying? Who is it you are looking for?"
Thinking he was the gardener, she said,
"Sir, if you have carried him away, tell
me where you have put him, and I will
get him."
16Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned
toward him and cried out in Aramaic,
"Rabboni!" (which means Teacher).
17Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I
have not yet returned to the Father. Go
instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I
am returning to my Father and your
Father, to my God and your God.' "
18Mary Magdalene went to the disciples
with the news: "I have seen the Lord!"
And she told them that he had said
these things to her.
19On the evening of that first day of the
week, when the disciples were together,
with the doors locked for fear of the
Jews, Jesus came and stood among
them and said, "Peace be with you!"
20After he said this, he showed them his
hands and side. The disciples were
overjoyed when they saw the Lord.
21Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you!
As the Father has sent me, I am
sending you."
22And with that he breathed on them and
said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.
23If you forgive anyone his sins, they are
forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they
are not forgiven."
24Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of
the Twelve, was not with the disciples
when Jesus came.
25So the other disciples told him, "We
have seen the Lord!" But he said to
them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his
hands and put my finger where the nails
were, and put my hand into his side, I
will not believe it."
26A week later his disciples were in the
house again, and Thomas was with
them. Though the doors were locked,
Jesus came and stood among them and
said, "Peace be with you!"
27Then he said to Thomas, "Put your
finger here; see my hands. Reach out
your hand and put it into my side. Stop
doubting and believe."
28Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my
God!"
29Then Jesus told him, "Because you
have seen me, you have believed;
blessed are those who have not seen
and yet have believed."
30Jesus did many other miraculous signs
in the presence of his disciples, which
are not recorded in this book.
31But these are written that you may
believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son
of God, and that by believing you may
have life in his name.
21Afterward Jesus appeared again
to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. It
happened this way:
2Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus),
Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the
sons of Zebedee, and two other
disciples were together.
3"I'm going out to fish," Simon Peter told
them, and they said, "We'll go with you."
So they went out and got into the boat,
but that night they caught nothing.
4Early in the morning, Jesus stood on
the shore, but the disciples did not
realize that it was Jesus.
5He called out to them, "Friends, haven't
you any fish?" "No," they answered.
6He said, "Throw your net on the right
side of the boat and you will find some."
When they did, they were unable to haul
the net in because of the large number
of fish.
7Then the disciple whom Jesus loved
said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" As soon as
Simon Peter heard him say, "It is the
Lord," he wrapped his outer garment
around him (for he had taken it off) and
jumped into the water.
8The other disciples followed in the boat,
towing the net full of fish, for they were
not far from shore, about a hundred
yards.
9When they landed, they saw a fire of
burning coals there with fish on it, and
some bread.
10Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the
fish you have just caught."
11Simon Peter climbed aboard and
dragged the net ashore. It was full of
large fish, 153, but even with so many
the net was not torn.
12Jesus said to them, "Come and have
breakfast." None of the disciples dared
ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it
was the Lord.
13Jesus came, took the bread and gave
it to them, and did the same with the fish.
14This was now the third time Jesus
appeared to his disciples after he was
raised from the dead.
15When they had finished eating, Jesus
said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John,
do you truly love me more than these?"
"Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I
love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs."
16Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John,
do you truly love me?" He answered,
"Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."
17The third time he said to him, "Simon
son of John, do you love me?" Peter
was hurt because Jesus asked him the
third time, "Do you love me?" He said,
"Lord, you know all things; you know
that I love you."
18Jesus said, "Feed my sheep. I tell you
the truth, when you were younger you
dressed yourself and went where you
wanted; but when you are old you will
stretch out your hands, and someone
else will dress you and lead you where
you do not want to go."
19Jesus said this to indicate the kind of
death by which Peter would glorify God.
Then he said to him, "Follow me!"
20Peter turned and saw that the disciple
whom Jesus loved was following them.
(This was the one who had leaned back
against Jesus at the supper and had
said, "Lord, who is going to betray
you?")
21When Peter saw him, he asked, "Lord,
what about him?"
22Jesus answered, "If I want him to
remain alive until I return, what is that to
you? You must follow me."
23Because of this, the rumor spread
among the brothers that this disciple
would not die. But Jesus did not say that
he would not die; he only said, "If I want
him to remain alive until I return, what is
that to you?"
24This is the disciple who testifies to
these things and who wrote them down.
We know that his testimony is true.
25Jesus did many other things as well. If
every one of them were written down, I
suppose that even the whole world
would not have room for the books that
would be written.
Acts
1In my former book, Theophilus, I
wrote about all that Jesus began to do
and to teach
2until the day he was taken up to heaven,
after giving instructions through the Holy
Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.
3After his suffering, he showed himself
to these men and gave many convincing
proofs that he was alive. He appeared to
them over a period of forty days and
spoke about the kingdom of God.
4On one occasion, while he was eating
with them, he gave them this command:
"Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the
gift my Father promised, which you have
heard me speak about.
5For John baptized with water, but in a
few days you will be baptized with the
Holy Spirit."
6So when they met together, they asked
him, "Lord, are you at this time going to
restore the kingdom to Israel?"
7He said to them: "It is not for you to
know the times or dates the Father has
set by his own authority.
8But you will receive power when the
Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will
be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all
Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of
the earth."
9After he said this, he was taken up
before their very eyes, and a cloud hid
him from their sight.
10They were looking intently up into the
sky as he was going, when suddenly
two men dressed in white stood beside
them.
11"Men of Galilee," they said, "why do
you stand here looking into the sky?
This same Jesus, who has been taken
from you into heaven, will come back in
the same way you have seen him go
into heaven."
12Then they returned to Jerusalem from
the hill called the Mount of Olives, a
Sabbath day's walk from the city.
13When they arrived, they went upstairs
to the room where they were staying.
Those present were Peter, John, James
and Andrew; Philip and Thomas,
Bartholomew and Matthew; James son
of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and
Judas son of James.
14They all joined together constantly in
prayer, along with the women and Mary
the mother of Jesus, and with his
brothers.
15In those days Peter stood up among
the believers (a group numbering about
a hundred and twenty)
16and said, "Brothers, the Scripture had
to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke
long ago through the mouth of David
concerning Judas, who served as guide
for those who arrested Jesus--
17he was one of our number and shared
in this ministry."
18(With the reward he got for his
wickedness, Judas bought a field; there
he fell headlong, his body burst open
and all his intestines spilled out.
19Everyone in Jerusalem heard about
this, so they called that field in their
language Akeldama, that is, Field of
Blood.)
20"For," said Peter, "it is written in the
book of Psalms, " 'May his place be
deserted; let there be no one to dwell in
it,' and, " 'May another take his place of
leadership.'
21Therefore it is necessary to choose
one of the men who have been with us
the whole time the Lord Jesus went in
and out among us,
22beginning from John's baptism to the
time when Jesus was taken up from us.
For one of these must become a
witness with us of his resurrection."
23So they proposed two men: Joseph
called Barsabbas (also known as
Justus) and Matthias.
24Then they prayed, "Lord, you know
everyone's heart. Show us which of
these two you have chosen
25to take over this apostolic ministry,
which Judas left to go where he
belongs."
26Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to
Matthias; so he was added to the eleven
apostles.
2When the day of Pentecost came,
they were all together in one place.
2Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a
violent wind came from heaven and
filled the whole house where they were
sitting.
3They saw what seemed to be tongues
of fire that separated and came to rest
on each of them.
4All of them were filled with the Holy
Spirit and began to speak in other
tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
5Now there were staying in Jerusalem
God-fearing Jews from every nation
under heaven.
6When they heard this sound, a crowd
came together in bewilderment,
because each one heard them speaking
in his own language.
7Utterly amazed, they asked: "Are not all
these men who are speaking Galileans?
8Then how is it that each of us hears
them in his own native language?
9Parthians, Medes and Elamites;
residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and
Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
10Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the
parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from
Rome
11(both Jews and converts to Judaism);
Cretans and Arabs--we hear them
declaring the wonders of God in our own
tongues!"
12Amazed and perplexed, they asked
one another, "What does this mean?"
13Some, however, made fun of them and
said, "They have had too much wine. "
14Then Peter stood up with the Eleven,
raised his voice and addressed the
crowd: "Fellow Jews and all of you who
live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to
you; listen carefully to what I say.
15These men are not drunk, as you
suppose. It's only nine in the morning!
16No, this is what was spoken by the
prophet Joel:
17" 'In the last days, God says, I will pour
out my Spirit on all people. Your sons
and daughters will prophesy, your young
men will see visions, your old men will
dream dreams.
18Even on my servants, both men and
women, I will pour out my Spirit in those
days, and they will prophesy.
19I will show wonders in the heaven
above and signs on the earth below,
blood and fire and billows of smoke.
20The sun will be turned to darkness and
the moon to blood before the coming of
the great and glorious day of the Lord.
21And everyone who calls on the name
of the Lord will be saved.'
22"Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of
Nazareth was a man accredited by God
to you by miracles, wonders and signs,
which God did among you through him,
as you yourselves know.
23This man was handed over to you by
God's set purpose and foreknowledge;
and you, with the help of wicked men,
put him to death by nailing him to the
cross.
24But God raised him from the dead,
freeing him from the agony of death,
because it was impossible for death to
keep its hold on him.
25David said about him: " 'I saw the Lord
always before me. Because he is at my
right hand, I will not be shaken.
26Therefore my heart is glad and my
tongue rejoices; my body also will live in
hope,
27because you will not abandon me to
the grave, nor will you let your Holy One
see decay.
28You have made known to me the
paths of life; you will fill me with joy in
your presence.'
29"Brothers, I can tell you confidently
that the patriarch David died and was
buried, and his tomb is here to this day.
30But he was a prophet and knew that
God had promised him on oath that he
would place one of his descendants on
his throne.
31Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of
the resurrection of the Christ, that he
was not abandoned to the grave, nor did
his body see decay.
32God has raised this Jesus to life, and
we are all witnesses of the fact.
33Exalted to the right hand of God, he
has received from the Father the
promised Holy Spirit and has poured out
what you now see and hear.
34For David did not ascend to heaven,
and yet he said, " 'The Lord said to my
Lord: "Sit at my right hand
35until I make your enemies a footstool
for your feet." '
36"Therefore let all Israel be assured of
this: God has made this Jesus, whom
you crucified, both Lord and Christ."
37When the people heard this, they were
cut to the heart and said to Peter and
the other apostles, "Brothers, what shall
we do?"
38Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized,
every one of you, in the name of Jesus
Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.
And you will receive the gift of the Holy
Spirit.
39The promise is for you and your
children and for all who are far off--for all
whom the Lord our God will call."
40With many other words he warned
them; and he pleaded with them, "Save
yourselves from this corrupt generation."
41Those who accepted his message
were baptized, and about three
thousand were added to their number
that day.
42They devoted themselves to the
apostles' teaching and to the fellowship,
to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
43Everyone was filled with awe, and
many wonders and miraculous signs
were done by the apostles.
44All the believers were together and
had everything in common.
45Selling their possessions and goods,
they gave to anyone as he had need.
46Every day they continued to meet
together in the temple courts. They
broke bread in their homes and ate
together with glad and sincere hearts,
47praising God and enjoying the favor of
all the people. And the Lord added to
their number daily those who were being
saved.
3One day Peter and John were going
up to the temple at the time of prayer--at
three in the afternoon.
2Now a man crippled from birth was
being carried to the temple gate called
Beautiful, where he was put every day
to beg from those going into the temple
courts.
3When he saw Peter and John about to
enter, he asked them for money.
4Peter looked straight at him, as did
John. Then Peter said, "Look at us!"
5So the man gave them his attention,
expecting to get something from them.
6Then Peter said, "Silver or gold I do not
have, but what I have I give you. In the
name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
walk."
7Taking him by the right hand, he helped
him up, and instantly the man's feet and
ankles became strong.
8He jumped to his feet and began to
walk. Then he went with them into the
temple courts, walking and jumping, and
praising God.
9When all the people saw him walking
and praising God,
10they recognized him as the same man
who used to sit begging at the temple
gate called Beautiful, and they were
filled with wonder and amazement at
what had happened to him.
11While the beggar held on to Peter and
John, all the people were astonished
and came running to them in the place
called Solomon's Colonnade.
12When Peter saw this, he said to them:
"Men of Israel, why does this surprise
you? Why do you stare at us as if by our
own power or godliness we had made
this man walk?
13The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
the God of our fathers, has glorified his
servant Jesus. You handed him over to
be killed, and you disowned him before
Pilate, though he had decided to let him
go.
14You disowned the Holy and Righteous
One and asked that a murderer be
released to you.
15You killed the author of life, but God
raised him from the dead. We are
witnesses of this.
16By faith in the name of Jesus, this man
whom you see and know was made
strong. It is Jesus' name and the faith
that comes through him that has given
this complete healing to him, as you can
all see.
17"Now, brothers, I know that you acted
in ignorance, as did your leaders.
18But this is how God fulfilled what he
had foretold through all the prophets,
saying that his Christ would suffer.
19Repent, then, and turn to God, so that
your sins may be wiped out, that times
of refreshing may come from the Lord,
20and that he may send the Christ, who
has been appointed for you--even Jesus.
21He must remain in heaven until the
time comes for God to restore
everything, as he promised long ago
through his holy prophets.
22For Moses said, 'The Lord your God
will raise up for you a prophet like me
from among your own people; you must
listen to everything he tells you.
23Anyone who does not listen to him will
be completely cut off from among his
people.'
24"Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel
on, as many as have spoken, have
foretold these days.
25And you are heirs of the prophets and
of the covenant God made with your
fathers. He said to Abraham, 'Through
your offspring all peoples on earth will
be blessed.'
26When God raised up his servant, he
sent him first to you to bless you by
turning each of you from your wicked
ways."
4The priests and the captain of the
temple guard and the Sadducees came
up to Peter and John while they were
speaking to the people.
2They were greatly disturbed because
the apostles were teaching the people
and proclaiming in Jesus the
resurrection of the dead.
3They seized Peter and John, and
because it was evening, they put them
in jail until the next day.
4But many who heard the message
believed, and the number of men grew
to about five thousand.
5The next day the rulers, elders and
teachers of the law met in Jerusalem.
6Annas the high priest was there, and so
were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and
the other men of the high priest's family.
7They had Peter and John brought
before them and began to question
them: "By what power or what name did
you do this?"
8Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit,
said to them: "Rulers and elders of the
people!
9If we are being called to account today
for an act of kindness shown to a cripple
and are asked how he was healed,
10then know this, you and all the people
of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus
Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified
but whom God raised from the dead,
that this man stands before you healed.
11He is " 'the stone you builders rejected,
which has become the capstone. '
12Salvation is found in no one else, for
there is no other name under heaven
given to men by which we must be
saved."
13When they saw the courage of Peter
and John and realized that they were
unschooled, ordinary men, they were
astonished and they took note that
these men had been with Jesus.
14But since they could see the man who
had been healed standing there with
them, there was nothing they could say.
15So they ordered them to withdraw from
the Sanhedrin and then conferred
together.
16"What are we going to do with these
men?" they asked. "Everybody living in
Jerusalem knows they have done an
outstanding miracle, and we cannot
deny it.
17But to stop this thing from spreading
any further among the people, we must
warn these men to speak no longer to
anyone in this name."
18Then they called them in again and
commanded them not to speak or teach
at all in the name of Jesus.
19But Peter and John replied, "Judge for
yourselves whether it is right in God's
sight to obey you rather than God.
20For we cannot help speaking about
what we have seen and heard."
21After further threats they let them go.
They could not decide how to punish
them, because all the people were
praising God for what had happened.
22For the man who was miraculously
healed was over forty years old.
23On their release, Peter and John went
back to their own people and reported
all that the chief priests and elders had
said to them.
24When they heard this, they raised their
voices together in prayer to God.
"Sovereign Lord," they said, "you made
the heaven and the earth and the sea,
and everything in them.
25You spoke by the Holy Spirit through
the mouth of your servant, our father
David: " 'Why do the nations rage and
the peoples plot in vain?
26The kings of the earth take their stand
and the rulers gather together against
the Lord and against his Anointed One. '
27Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met
together with the Gentiles and the
people of Israel in this city to conspire
against your holy servant Jesus, whom
you anointed.
28They did what your power and will had
decided beforehand should happen.
29Now, Lord, consider their threats and
enable your servants to speak your
word with great boldness.
30Stretch out your hand to heal and
perform miraculous signs and wonders
through the name of your holy servant
Jesus."
31After they prayed, the place where
they were meeting was shaken. And
they were all filled with the Holy Spirit
and spoke the word of God boldly.
32All the believers were one in heart and
mind. No one claimed that any of his
possessions was his own, but they
shared everything they had.
33With great power the apostles
continued to testify to the resurrection of
the Lord Jesus, and much grace was
upon them all.
34There were no needy persons among
them. For from time to time those who
owned lands or houses sold them,
brought the money from the sales
35and put it at the apostles' feet, and it
was distributed to anyone as he had
need.
36Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom
the apostles called Barnabas (which
means Son of Encouragement),
37sold a field he owned and brought the
money and put it at the apostles' feet.
5Now a man named Ananias, together
with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece
of property.
2With his wife's full knowledge he kept
back part of the money for himself, but
brought the rest and put it at the
apostles' feet.
3Then Peter said, "Ananias, how is it
that Satan has so filled your heart that
you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have
kept for yourself some of the money you
received for the land?
4Didn't it belong to you before it was
sold? And after it was sold, wasn't the
money at your disposal? What made
you think of doing such a thing? You
have not lied to men but to God."
5When Ananias heard this, he fell down
and died. And great fear seized all who
heard what had happened.
6Then the young men came forward,
wrapped up his body, and carried him
out and buried him.
7About three hours later his wife came in,
not knowing what had happened.
8Peter asked her, "Tell me, is this the
price you and Ananias got for the land?"
"Yes," she said, "that is the price."
9Peter said to her, "How could you
agree to test the Spirit of the Lord?
Look! The feet of the men who buried
your husband are at the door, and they
will carry you out also."
10At that moment she fell down at his
feet and died. Then the young men
came in and, finding her dead, carried
her out and buried her beside her
husband.
11Great fear seized the whole church
and all who heard about these events.
12The apostles performed many
miraculous signs and wonders among
the people. And all the believers used to
meet together in Solomon's Colonnade.
13No one else dared join them, even
though they were highly regarded by the
people.
14Nevertheless, more and more men
and women believed in the Lord and
were added to their number.
15As a result, people brought the sick
into the streets and laid them on beds
and mats so that at least Peter's shadow
might fall on some of them as he passed
by.
16Crowds gathered also from the towns
around Jerusalem, bringing their sick
and those tormented by evil spirits, and
all of them were healed.
17Then the high priest and all his
associates, who were members of the
party of the Sadducees, were filled with
jealousy.
18They arrested the apostles and put
them in the public jail.
19But during the night an angel of the
Lord opened the doors of the jail and
brought them out.
20"Go, stand in the temple courts," he
said, "and tell the people the full
message of this new life."
21At daybreak they entered the temple
courts, as they had been told, and
began to teach the people.
22When the high priest and his
associates arrived, they called together
the Sanhedrin--the full assembly of the
elders of Israel--and sent to the jail for
the apostles. But on arriving at the jail,
the officers did not find them there. So
they went back and reported,
23"We found the jail securely locked,
with the guards standing at the doors;
but when we opened them, we found no
one inside."
24On hearing this report, the captain of
the temple guard and the chief priests
were puzzled, wondering what would
come of this.
25Then someone came and said, "Look!
The men you put in jail are standing in
the temple courts teaching the people."
26At that, the captain went with his
officers and brought the apostles. They
did not use force, because they feared
that the people would stone them.
27Having brought the apostles, they
made them appear before the
Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high
priest.
28"We gave you strict orders not to teach
in this name," he said. "Yet you have
filled Jerusalem with your teaching and
are determined to make us guilty of this
man's blood."
29Peter and the other apostles replied:
"We must obey God rather than men!
30The God of our fathers raised Jesus
from the dead--whom you had killed by
hanging him on a tree.
31God exalted him to his own right hand
as Prince and Savior that he might give
repentance and forgiveness of sins to
Israel.
32We are witnesses of these things, and
so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has
given to those who obey him."
33When they heard this, they were
furious and wanted to put them to death.
34But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a
teacher of the law, who was honored by
all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin
and ordered that the men be put outside
for a little while.
35Then he addressed them: "Men of
Israel, consider carefully what you
intend to do to these men.
36Some time ago Theudas appeared,
claiming to be somebody, and about
four hundred men rallied to him. He was
killed, all his followers were dispersed,
and it all came to nothing.
37After him, Judas the Galilean
appeared in the days of the census and
led a band of people in revolt. He too
was killed, and all his followers were
scattered.
38Therefore, in the present case I advise
you: Leave these men alone! Let them
go! For if their purpose or activity is of
human origin, it will fail.
39But if it is from God, you will not be
able to stop these men; you will only find
yourselves fighting against God."
40His speech persuaded them. They
called the apostles in and had them
flogged. Then they ordered them not to
speak in the name of Jesus, and let
them go.
41The apostles left the Sanhedrin,
rejoicing because they had been
counted worthy of suffering disgrace for
the Name.
42Day after day, in the temple courts and
from house to house, they never
stopped teaching and proclaiming the
good news that Jesus is the Christ.
6In those days when the number of
disciples was increasing, the Grecian
Jews among them complained against
the Hebraic Jews because their widows
were being overlooked in the daily
distribution of food.
2So the Twelve gathered all the disciples
together and said, "It would not be right
for us to neglect the ministry of the word
of God in order to wait on tables.
3Brothers, choose seven men from
among you who are known to be full of
the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this
responsibility over to them
4and will give our attention to prayer and
the ministry of the word."
5This proposal pleased the whole group.
They chose Stephen, a man full of faith
and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip,
Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas,
and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to
Judaism.
6They presented these men to the
apostles, who prayed and laid their
hands on them.
7So the word of God spread. The
number of disciples in Jerusalem
increased rapidly, and a large number of
priests became obedient to the faith.
8Now Stephen, a man full of God's
grace and power, did great wonders and
miraculous signs among the people.
9Opposition arose, however, from
members of the Synagogue of the
Freedmen (as it was called)--Jews of
Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the
provinces of Cilicia and Asia. These
men began to argue with Stephen,
10but they could not stand up against his
wisdom or the Spirit by whom he spoke.
11Then they secretly persuaded some
men to say, "We have heard Stephen
speak words of blasphemy against
Moses and against God."
12So they stirred up the people and the
elders and the teachers of the law. They
seized Stephen and brought him before
the Sanhedrin.
13They produced false witnesses, who
testified, "This fellow never stops
speaking against this holy place and
against the law.
14For we have heard him say that this
Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place
and change the customs Moses handed
down to us."
15All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin
looked intently at Stephen, and they saw
that his face was like the face of an
angel.
7Then the high priest asked him, "Are
these charges true?"
2To this he replied: "Brothers and
fathers, listen to me! The God of glory
appeared to our father Abraham while
he was still in Mesopotamia, before he
lived in Haran.
3'Leave your country and your people,'
God said, 'and go to the land I will show
you.'
4"So he left the land of the Chaldeans
and settled in Haran. After the death of
his father, God sent him to this land
where you are now living.
5He gave him no inheritance here, not
even a foot of ground. But God
promised him that he and his
descendants after him would possess
the land, even though at that time
Abraham had no child.
6God spoke to him in this way: 'Your
descendants will be strangers in a
country not their own, and they will be
enslaved and mistreated four hundred
years.
7But I will punish the nation they serve
as slaves,' God said, 'and afterward they
will come out of that country and
worship me in this place.'
8Then he gave Abraham the covenant of
circumcision. And Abraham became the
father of Isaac and circumcised him
eight days after his birth. Later Isaac
became the father of Jacob, and Jacob
became the father of the twelve
patriarchs.
9"Because the patriarchs were jealous of
Joseph, they sold him as a slave into
Egypt. But God was with him
10and rescued him from all his troubles.
He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled
him to gain the goodwill of Pharaoh king
of Egypt; so he made him ruler over
Egypt and all his palace.
11"Then a famine struck all Egypt and
Canaan, bringing great suffering, and
our fathers could not find food.
12When Jacob heard that there was
grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers on
their first visit.
13On their second visit, Joseph told his
brothers who he was, and Pharaoh
learned about Joseph's family.
14After this, Joseph sent for his father
Jacob and his whole family, seventy-five
in all.
15Then Jacob went down to Egypt,
where he and our fathers died.
16Their bodies were brought back to
Shechem and placed in the tomb that
Abraham had bought from the sons of
Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of
money.
17"As the time drew near for God to fulfill
his promise to Abraham, the number of
our people in Egypt greatly increased.
18Then another king, who knew nothing
about Joseph, became ruler of Egypt.
19He dealt treacherously with our people
and oppressed our forefathers by
forcing them to throw out their newborn
babies so that they would die.
20"At that time Moses was born, and he
was no ordinary child. For three months
he was cared for in his father's house.
21When he was placed outside,
Pharaoh's daughter took him and
brought him up as her own son.
22Moses was educated in all the wisdom
of the Egyptians and was powerful in
speech and action.
23"When Moses was forty years old, he
decided to visit his fellow Israelites.
24He saw one of them being mistreated
by an Egyptian, so he went to his
defense and avenged him by killing the
Egyptian.
25Moses thought that his own people
would realize that God was using him to
rescue them, but they did not.
26The next day Moses came upon two
Israelites who were fighting. He tried to
reconcile them by saying, 'Men, you are
brothers; why do you want to hurt each
other?'
27"But the man who was mistreating the
other pushed Moses aside and said,
'Who made you ruler and judge over us?
28Do you want to kill me as you killed the
Egyptian yesterday?'
29When Moses heard this, he fled to
Midian, where he settled as a foreigner
and had two sons.
30"After forty years had passed, an angel
appeared to Moses in the flames of a
burning bush in the desert near Mount
Sinai.
31When he saw this, he was amazed at
the sight. As he went over to look more
closely, he heard the Lord's voice:
32'I am the God of your fathers, the God
of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.' Moses
trembled with fear and did not dare to
look.
33"Then the Lord said to him, 'Take off
your sandals; the place where you are
standing is holy ground.
34I have indeed seen the oppression of
my people in Egypt. I have heard their
groaning and have come down to set
them free. Now come, I will send you
back to Egypt.'
35"This is the same Moses whom they
had rejected with the words, 'Who made
you ruler and judge?' He was sent to be
their ruler and deliverer by God himself,
through the angel who appeared to him
in the bush.
36He led them out of Egypt and did
wonders and miraculous signs in Egypt,
at the Red Sea and for forty years in the
desert.
37"This is that Moses who told the
Israelites, 'God will send you a prophet
like me from your own people.'
38He was in the assembly in the desert,
with the angel who spoke to him on
Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and
he received living words to pass on to
us.
39"But our fathers refused to obey him.
Instead, they rejected him and in their
hearts turned back to Egypt.
40They told Aaron, 'Make us gods who
will go before us. As for this fellow
Moses who led us out of Egypt--we don't
know what has happened to him!'
41That was the time they made an idol in
the form of a calf. They brought
sacrifices to it and held a celebration in
honor of what their hands had made.
42But God turned away and gave them
over to the worship of the heavenly
bodies. This agrees with what is written
in the book of the prophets: " 'Did you
bring me sacrifices and offerings forty
years in the desert, O house of Israel?
43You have lifted up the shrine of
Molech and the star of your god Rephan,
the idols you made to worship.
Therefore I will send you into exile'
beyond Babylon.
44"Our forefathers had the tabernacle of
the Testimony with them in the desert. It
had been made as God directed Moses,
according to the pattern he had seen.
45Having received the tabernacle, our
fathers under Joshua brought it with
them when they took the land from the
nations God drove out before them. It
remained in the land until the time of
David,
46who enjoyed God's favor and asked
that he might provide a dwelling place
for the God of Jacob.
47But it was Solomon who built the
house for him.
48"However, the Most High does not live
in houses made by men. As the prophet
says:
49" 'Heaven is my throne, and the earth
is my footstool. What kind of house will
you build for me? says the Lord. Or
where will my resting place be?
50Has not my hand made all these
things?'
51"You stiff-necked people, with
uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are
just like your fathers: You always resist
the Holy Spirit!
52Was there ever a prophet your fathers
did not persecute? They even killed
those who predicted the coming of the
Righteous One. And now you have
betrayed and murdered him--
53you who have received the law that
was put into effect through angels but
have not obeyed it."
54When they heard this, they were
furious and gnashed their teeth at him.
55But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit,
looked up to heaven and saw the glory
of God, and Jesus standing at the right
hand of God.
56"Look," he said, "I see heaven open
and the Son of Man standing at the right
hand of God."
57At this they covered their ears and,
yelling at the top of their voices, they all
rushed at him,
58dragged him out of the city and began
to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses
laid their clothes at the feet of a young
man named Saul.
59While they were stoning him, Stephen
prayed, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
60Then he fell on his knees and cried out,
"Lord, do not hold this sin against them."
When he had said this, he fell asleep.
8And Saul was there, giving approval
to his death.On that day a great
persecution broke out against the
church at Jerusalem, and all except the
apostles were scattered throughout
Judea and Samaria.
2Godly men buried Stephen and
mourned deeply for him.
3But Saul began to destroy the church.
Going from house to house, he dragged
off men and women and put them in
prison.
4Those who had been scattered
preached the word wherever they went.
5Philip went down to a city in Samaria
and proclaimed the Christ there.
6When the crowds heard Philip and saw
the miraculous signs he did, they all
paid close attention to what he said.
7With shrieks, evil spirits came out of
many, and many paralytics and cripples
were healed.
8So there was great joy in that city.
9Now for some time a man named
Simon had practiced sorcery in the city
and amazed all the people of Samaria.
He boasted that he was someone great,
10and all the people, both high and low,
gave him their attention and exclaimed,
"This man is the divine power known as
the Great Power."
11They followed him because he had
amazed them for a long time with his
magic.
12But when they believed Philip as he
preached the good news of the kingdom
of God and the name of Jesus Christ,
they were baptized, both men and
women.
13Simon himself believed and was
baptized. And he followed Philip
everywhere, astonished by the great
signs and miracles he saw.
14When the apostles in Jerusalem heard
that Samaria had accepted the word of
God, they sent Peter and John to them.
15When they arrived, they prayed for
them that they might receive the Holy
Spirit,
16because the Holy Spirit had not yet
come upon any of them; they had simply
been baptized into the name of the Lord
Jesus.
17Then Peter and John placed their
hands on them, and they received the
Holy Spirit.
18When Simon saw that the Spirit was
given at the laying on of the apostles'
hands, he offered them money
19and said, "Give me also this ability so
that everyone on whom I lay my hands
may receive the Holy Spirit."
20Peter answered: "May your money
perish with you, because you thought
you could buy the gift of God with
money!
21You have no part or share in this
ministry, because your heart is not right
before God.
22Repent of this wickedness and pray to
the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive you for
having such a thought in your heart.
23For I see that you are full of bitterness
and captive to sin."
24Then Simon answered, "Pray to the
Lord for me so that nothing you have
said may happen to me."
25When they had testified and
proclaimed the word of the Lord, Peter
and John returned to Jerusalem,
preaching the gospel in many Samaritan
villages.
26Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip,
"Go south to the road--the desert road--
that goes down from Jerusalem to
Gaza."
27So he started out, and on his way he
met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important
official in charge of all the treasury of
Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. This
man had gone to Jerusalem to worship,
28and on his way home was sitting in his
chariot reading the book of Isaiah the
prophet.
29The Spirit told Philip, "Go to that
chariot and stay near it."
30Then Philip ran up to the chariot and
heard the man reading Isaiah the
prophet. "Do you understand what you
are reading?" Philip asked.
31"How can I," he said, "unless someone
explains it to me?" So he invited Philip
to come up and sit with him.
32The eunuch was reading this passage
of Scripture: "He was led like a sheep to
the slaughter, and as a lamb before the
shearer is silent, so he did not open his
mouth.
33In his humiliation he was deprived of
justice. Who can speak of his
descendants? For his life was taken
from the earth."
34The eunuch asked Philip, "Tell me,
please, who is the prophet talking about,
himself or someone else?"
35Then Philip began with that very
passage of Scripture and told him the
good news about Jesus.
36As they traveled along the road, they
came to some water and the eunuch
said, "Look, here is water. Why shouldn't
I be baptized?"
38And he gave orders to stop the chariot.
Then both Philip and the eunuch went
down into the water and Philip baptized
him.
39When they came up out of the water,
the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took
Philip away, and the eunuch did not see
him again, but went on his way rejoicing.
40Philip, however, appeared at Azotus
and traveled about, preaching the
gospel in all the towns until he reached
Caesarea.
9Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing
out murderous threats against the Lord's
disciples. He went to the high priest
2and asked him for letters to the
synagogues in Damascus, so that if he
found any there who belonged to the
Way, whether men or women, he might
take them as prisoners to Jerusalem.
3As he neared Damascus on his journey,
suddenly a light from heaven flashed
around him.
4He fell to the ground and heard a voice
say to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you
persecute me?"
5"Who are you, Lord?" Saul asked.
6"I am Jesus, whom you are
persecuting," he replied. "Now get up
and go into the city, and you will be told
what you must do."
7The men traveling with Saul stood there
speechless; they heard the sound but
did not see anyone.
8Saul got up from the ground, but when
he opened his eyes he could see
nothing. So they led him by the hand
into Damascus.
9For three days he was blind, and did
not eat or drink anything.
10In Damascus there was a disciple
named Ananias. The Lord called to him
in a vision, "Ananias!" "Yes, Lord," he
answered.
11The Lord told him, "Go to the house of
Judas on Straight Street and ask for a
man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is
praying.
12In a vision he has seen a man named
Ananias come and place his hands on
him to restore his sight."
13"Lord," Ananias answered, "I have
heard many reports about this man and
all the harm he has done to your saints
in Jerusalem.
14And he has come here with authority
from the chief priests to arrest all who
call on your name."
15But the Lord said to Ananias, "Go! This
man is my chosen instrument to carry
my name before the Gentiles and their
kings and before the people of Israel.
16I will show him how much he must
suffer for my name."
17Then Ananias went to the house and
entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he
said, "Brother Saul, the Lord--Jesus,
who appeared to you on the road as you
were coming here--has sent me so that
you may see again and be filled with the
Holy Spirit."
18Immediately, something like scales fell
from Saul's eyes, and he could see
again. He got up and was baptized,
19and after taking some food, he
regained his strength.
20Saul spent several days with the
disciples in Damascus. At once he
began to preach in the synagogues that
Jesus is the Son of God.
21All those who heard him were
astonished and asked, "Isn't he the man
who raised havoc in Jerusalem among
those who call on this name? And hasn't
he come here to take them as prisoners
to the chief priests?"
22Yet Saul grew more and more
powerful and baffled the Jews living in
Damascus by proving that Jesus is the
Christ.
23After many days had gone by, the
Jews conspired to kill him,
24but Saul learned of their plan. Day and
night they kept close watch on the city
gates in order to kill him.
25But his followers took him by night and
lowered him in a basket through an
opening in the wall.
26When he came to Jerusalem, he tried
to join the disciples, but they were all
afraid of him, not believing that he really
was a disciple.
27But Barnabas took him and brought
him to the apostles. He told them how
Saul on his journey had seen the Lord
and that the Lord had spoken to him,
and how in Damascus he had preached
fearlessly in the name of Jesus.
28So Saul stayed with them and moved
about freely in Jerusalem, speaking
boldly in the name of the Lord.
29He talked and debated with the
Grecian Jews, but they tried to kill him.
30When the brothers learned of this, they
took him down to Caesarea and sent
him off to Tarsus.
31Then the church throughout Judea,
Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of
peace. It was strengthened; and
encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it grew in
numbers, living in the fear of the Lord.
32As Peter traveled about the country,
he went to visit the saints in Lydda.
33There he found a man named Aeneas,
a paralytic who had been bedridden for
eight years.
34"Aeneas," Peter said to him, "Jesus
Christ heals you. Get up and take care
of your mat." Immediately Aeneas got
up.
35All those who lived in Lydda and
Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
36In Joppa there was a disciple named
Tabitha (which, when translated, is
Dorcas ), who was always doing good
and helping the poor.
37About that time she became sick and
died, and her body was washed and
placed in an upstairs room.
38Lydda was near Joppa; so when the
disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda,
they sent two men to him and urged him,
"Please come at once!"
39Peter went with them, and when he
arrived he was taken upstairs to the
room. All the widows stood around him,
crying and showing him the robes and
other clothing that Dorcas had made
while she was still with them.
40Peter sent them all out of the room;
then he got down on his knees and
prayed. Turning toward the dead woman,
he said, "Tabitha, get up." She opened
her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.
41He took her by the hand and helped
her to her feet. Then he called the
believers and the widows and presented
her to them alive.
42This became known all over Joppa,
and many people believed in the Lord.
43Peter stayed in Joppa for some time
with a tanner named Simon.
10At Caesarea there was a man
named Cornelius, a centurion in what
was known as the Italian Regiment.
2He and all his family were devout and
God-fearing; he gave generously to
those in need and prayed to God
regularly.
3One day at about three in the afternoon
he had a vision. He distinctly saw an
angel of God, who came to him and said,
"Cornelius!"
4Cornelius stared at him in fear. "What is
it, Lord?" he asked.
5The angel answered, "Your prayers
and gifts to the poor have come up as a
memorial offering before God. Now
send men to Joppa to bring back a man
named Simon who is called Peter.
6He is staying with Simon the tanner,
whose house is by the sea."
7When the angel who spoke to him had
gone, Cornelius called two of his
servants and a devout soldier who was
one of his attendants.
8He told them everything that had
happened and sent them to Joppa.
9About noon the following day as they
were on their journey and approaching
the city, Peter went up on the roof to
pray.
10He became hungry and wanted
something to eat, and while the meal
was being prepared, he fell into a trance.
11He saw heaven opened and
something like a large sheet being let
down to earth by its four corners.
12It contained all kinds of four-footed
animals, as well as reptiles of the earth
and birds of the air.
13Then a voice told him, "Get up, Peter.
Kill and eat."
14"Surely not, Lord!" Peter replied. "I
have never eaten anything impure or
unclean."
15The voice spoke to him a second time,
"Do not call anything impure that God
has made clean."
16This happened three times, and
immediately the sheet was taken back
to heaven.
17While Peter was wondering about the
meaning of the vision, the men sent by
Cornelius found out where Simon's
house was and stopped at the gate.
18They called out, asking if Simon who
was known as Peter was staying there.
19While Peter was still thinking about the
vision, the Spirit said to him, "Simon,
three men are looking for you.
20So get up and go downstairs. Do not
hesitate to go with them, for I have sent
them."
21Peter went down and said to the men,
"I'm the one you're looking for. Why
have you come?"
22The men replied, "We have come from
Cornelius the centurion. He is a
righteous and God-fearing man, who is
respected by all the Jewish people. A
holy angel told him to have you come to
his house so that he could hear what
you have to say."
23Then Peter invited the men into the
house to be his guests.
24The next day Peter started out with
them, and some of the brothers from
Joppa went along. The following day he
arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was
expecting them and had called together
his relatives and close friends.
25As Peter entered the house, Cornelius
met him and fell at his feet in reverence.
26But Peter made him get up. "Stand
up," he said, "I am only a man myself."
27Talking with him, Peter went inside
and found a large gathering of people.
28He said to them: "You are well aware
that it is against our law for a Jew to
associate with a Gentile or visit him. But
God has shown me that I should not call
any man impure or unclean.
29So when I was sent for, I came without
raising any objection. May I ask why you
sent for me?"
30Cornelius answered: "Four days ago I
was in my house praying at this hour, at
three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man
in shining clothes stood before me
31and said, 'Cornelius, God has heard
your prayer and remembered your gifts
to the poor.
32Send to Joppa for Simon who is called
Peter. He is a guest in the home of
Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.'
33So I sent for you immediately, and it
was good of you to come. Now we are
all here in the presence of God to listen
to everything the Lord has commanded
you to tell us."
34Then Peter began to speak: "I now
realize how true it is that God does not
show favoritism
35but accepts men from every nation
who fear him and do what is right.
36You know the message God sent to
the people of Israel, telling the good
news of peace through Jesus Christ,
who is Lord of all.
37You know what has happened
throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee
after the baptism that John preached--
38how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth
with the Holy Spirit and power, and how
he went around doing good and healing
all who were under the power of the
devil, because God was with him.
39"We are witnesses of everything he did
in the country of the Jews and in
Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging
him on a tree,
40but God raised him from the dead on
the third day and caused him to be seen.
41He was not seen by all the people, but
by witnesses whom God had already
chosen--by us who ate and drank with
him after he rose from the dead.
42He commanded us to preach to the
people and to testify that he is the one
whom God appointed as judge of the
living and the dead.
43All the prophets testify about him that
everyone who believes in him receives
forgiveness of sins through his name."
44While Peter was still speaking these
words, the Holy Spirit came on all who
heard the message.
45The circumcised believers who had
come with Peter were astonished that
the gift of the Holy Spirit had been
poured out even on the Gentiles.
46For they heard them speaking in
tongues and praising God.
47Then Peter said, "Can anyone keep
these people from being baptized with
water? They have received the Holy
Spirit just as we have."
48So he ordered that they be baptized in
the name of Jesus Christ. Then they
asked Peter to stay with them for a few
days.
11The apostles and the brothers
throughout Judea heard that the
Gentiles also had received the word of
God.
2So when Peter went up to Jerusalem,
the circumcised believers criticized him
3and said, "You went into the house of
uncircumcised men and ate with them."
4Peter began and explained everything
to them precisely as it had happened:
5"I was in the city of Joppa praying, and
in a trance I saw a vision. I saw
something like a large sheet being let
down from heaven by its four corners,
and it came down to where I was.
6I looked into it and saw four-footed
animals of the earth, wild beasts,
reptiles, and birds of the air.
7Then I heard a voice telling me, 'Get up,
Peter. Kill and eat.'
8"I replied, 'Surely not, Lord! Nothing
impure or unclean has ever entered my
mouth.'
9"The voice spoke from heaven a
second time, 'Do not call anything
impure that God has made clean.'
10This happened three times, and then it
was all pulled up to heaven again.
11"Right then three men who had been
sent to me from Caesarea stopped at
the house where I was staying.
12The Spirit told me to have no
hesitation about going with them. These
six brothers also went with me, and we
entered the man's house.
13He told us how he had seen an angel
appear in his house and say, 'Send to
Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.
14He will bring you a message through
which you and all your household will be
saved.'
15"As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit
came on them as he had come on us at
the beginning.
16Then I remembered what the Lord had
said: 'John baptized with water, but you
will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'
17So if God gave them the same gift as
he gave us, who believed in the Lord
Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I
could oppose God?"
18When they heard this, they had no
further objections and praised God,
saying, "So then, God has granted even
the Gentiles repentance unto life."
19Now those who had been scattered by
the persecution in connection with
Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia,
Cyprus and Antioch, telling the message
only to Jews.
20Some of them, however, men from
Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and
began to speak to Greeks also, telling
them the good news about the Lord
Jesus.
21The Lord's hand was with them, and a
great number of people believed and
turned to the Lord.
22News of this reached the ears of the
church at Jerusalem, and they sent
Barnabas to Antioch.
23When he arrived and saw the
evidence of the grace of God, he was
glad and encouraged them all to remain
true to the Lord with all their hearts.
24He was a good man, full of the Holy
Spirit and faith, and a great number of
people were brought to the Lord.
25Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look
for Saul,
26and when he found him, he brought
him to Antioch. So for a whole year
Barnabas and Saul met with the church
and taught great numbers of people.
The disciples were called Christians first
at Antioch.
27During this time some prophets came
down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
28One of them, named Agabus, stood up
and through the Spirit predicted that a
severe famine would spread over the
entire Roman world. (This happened
during the reign of Claudius.)
29The disciples, each according to his
ability, decided to provide help for the
brothers living in Judea.
30This they did, sending their gift to the
elders by Barnabas and Saul.
12It was about this time that King
Herod arrested some who belonged to
the church, intending to persecute them.
2He had James, the brother of John, put
to death with the sword.
3When he saw that this pleased the
Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also.
This happened during the Feast of
Unleavened Bread.
4After arresting him, he put him in prison,
handing him over to be guarded by four
squads of four soldiers each. Herod
intended to bring him out for public trial
after the Passover.
5So Peter was kept in prison, but the
church was earnestly praying to God for
him.
6The night before Herod was to bring
him to trial, Peter was sleeping between
two soldiers, bound with two chains, and
sentries stood guard at the entrance.
7Suddenly an angel of the Lord
appeared and a light shone in the cell.
He struck Peter on the side and woke
him up. "Quick, get up!" he said, and the
chains fell off Peter's wrists.
8Then the angel said to him, "Put on
your clothes and sandals." And Peter
did so. "Wrap your cloak around you
and follow me," the angel told him.
9Peter followed him out of the prison, but
he had no idea that what the angel was
doing was really happening; he thought
he was seeing a vision.
10They passed the first and second
guards and came to the iron gate
leading to the city. It opened for them by
itself, and they went through it. When
they had walked the length of one street,
suddenly the angel left him.
11Then Peter came to himself and said,
"Now I know without a doubt that the
Lord sent his angel and rescued me
from Herod's clutches and from
everything the Jewish people were
anticipating."
12When this had dawned on him, he
went to the house of Mary the mother of
John, also called Mark, where many
people had gathered and were praying.
13Peter knocked at the outer entrance,
and a servant girl named Rhoda came
to answer the door.
14When she recognized Peter's voice,
she was so overjoyed she ran back
without opening it and exclaimed, "Peter
is at the door!"
15"You're out of your mind," they told her.
When she kept insisting that it was so,
they said, "It must be his angel."
16But Peter kept on knocking, and when
they opened the door and saw him, they
were astonished.
17Peter motioned with his hand for them
to be quiet and described how the Lord
had brought him out of prison. "Tell
James and the brothers about this," he
said, and then he left for another place.
18In the morning, there was no small
commotion among the soldiers as to
what had become of Peter.
19After Herod had a thorough search
made for him and did not find him, he
cross-examined the guards and ordered
that they be executed.
20Then Herod went from Judea to
Caesarea and stayed there a while. He
had been quarreling with the people of
Tyre and Sidon; they now joined
together and sought an audience with
him. Having secured the support of
Blastus, a trusted personal servant of
the king, they asked for peace, because
they depended on the king's country for
their food supply.
21On the appointed day Herod, wearing
his royal robes, sat on his throne and
delivered a public address to the people.
22They shouted, "This is the voice of a
god, not of a man."
23Immediately, because Herod did not
give praise to God, an angel of the Lord
struck him down, and he was eaten by
worms and died.
24But the word of God continued to
increase and spread.
25When Barnabas and Saul had finished
their mission, they returned from
Jerusalem, taking with them John, also
called Mark.
13In the church at Antioch there
were prophets and teachers: Barnabas,
Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene,
Manaen (who had been brought up with
Herod the tetrarch) and Saul.
2While they were worshiping the Lord
and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set
apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the
work to which I have called them."
3So after they had fasted and prayed,
they placed their hands on them and
sent them off.
4The two of them, sent on their way by
the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia
and sailed from there to Cyprus.
5When they arrived at Salamis, they
proclaimed the word of God in the
Jewish synagogues. John was with
them as their helper.
6They traveled through the whole island
until they came to Paphos. There they
met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet
named Bar-Jesus,
7who was an attendant of the proconsul,
Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, an
intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and
Saul because he wanted to hear the
word of God.
8But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is
what his name means) opposed them
and tried to turn the proconsul from the
faith.
9Then Saul, who was also called Paul,
filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight
at Elymas and said,
10"You are a child of the devil and an
enemy of everything that is right! You
are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery.
Will you never stop perverting the right
ways of the Lord?
11Now the hand of the Lord is against
you. You are going to be blind, and for a
time you will be unable to see the light
of the sun."
12Immediately mist and darkness came
over him, and he groped about, seeking
someone to lead him by the hand. When
the proconsul saw what had happened,
he believed, for he was amazed at the
teaching about the Lord.
13From Paphos, Paul and his
companions sailed to Perga in
Pamphylia, where John left them to
return to Jerusalem.
14From Perga they went on to Pisidian
Antioch. On the Sabbath they entered
the synagogue and sat down.
15After the reading from the Law and the
Prophets, the synagogue rulers sent
word to them, saying, "Brothers, if you
have a message of encouragement for
the people, please speak."
16Standing up, Paul motioned with his
hand and said: "Men of Israel and you
Gentiles who worship God, listen to me!
17The God of the people of Israel chose
our fathers; he made the people prosper
during their stay in Egypt, with mighty
power he led them out of that country,
18he endured their conduct for about
forty years in the desert,
19he overthrew seven nations in Canaan
and gave their land to his people as
their inheritance.
20All this took about 450 years.
21"After this, God gave them judges until
the time of Samuel the prophet. Then
the people asked for a king, and he
gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe
of Benjamin, who ruled forty years.
22After removing Saul, he made David
their king. He testified concerning him: 'I
have found David son of Jesse a man
after my own heart; he will do everything
I want him to do.'
23"From this man's descendants God
has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus,
as he promised.
24Before the coming of Jesus, John
preached repentance and baptism to all
the people of Israel.
25As John was completing his work, he
said: 'Who do you think I am? I am not
that one. No, but he is coming after me,
whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.'
26"Brothers, children of Abraham, and
you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that
this message of salvation has been sent.
27The people of Jerusalem and their
rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in
condemning him they fulfilled the words
of the prophets that are read every
Sabbath.
28Though they found no proper ground
for a death sentence, they asked Pilate
to have him executed.
29When they had carried out all that was
written about him, they took him down
from the tree and laid him in a tomb.
30But God raised him from the dead,
31and for many days he was seen by
those who had traveled with him from
Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his
witnesses to our people.
32"We tell you the good news: What God
promised our fathers
33he has fulfilled for us, their children, by
raising up Jesus. As it is written in the
second Psalm: " 'You are my Son; today
I have become your Father. '
34The fact that God raised him from the
dead, never to decay, is stated in these
words: " 'I will give you the holy and sure
blessings promised to David.'
35So it is stated elsewhere: " 'You will
not let your Holy One see decay.'
36"For when David had served God's
purpose in his own generation, he fell
asleep; he was buried with his fathers
and his body decayed.
37But the one whom God raised from the
dead did not see decay.
38"Therefore, my brothers, I want you to
know that through Jesus the forgiveness
of sins is proclaimed to you.
39Through him everyone who believes is
justified from everything you could not
be justified from by the law of Moses.
40Take care that what the prophets have
said does not happen to you:
41" 'Look, you scoffers, wonder and
perish, for I am going to do something in
your days that you would never believe,
even if someone told you.' "
42As Paul and Barnabas were leaving
the synagogue, the people invited them
to speak further about these things on
the next Sabbath.
43When the congregation was dismissed,
many of the Jews and devout converts
to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas,
who talked with them and urged them to
continue in the grace of God.
44On the next Sabbath almost the whole
city gathered to hear the word of the
Lord.
45When the Jews saw the crowds, they
were filled with jealousy and talked
abusively against what Paul was saying.
46Then Paul and Barnabas answered
them boldly: "We had to speak the word
of God to you first. Since you reject it
and do not consider yourselves worthy
of eternal life, we now turn to the
Gentiles.
47For this is what the Lord has
commanded us: " 'I have made you a
light for the Gentiles, that you may bring
salvation to the ends of the earth.' "
48When the Gentiles heard this, they
were glad and honored the word of the
Lord; and all who were appointed for
eternal life believed.
49The word of the Lord spread through
the whole region.
50But the Jews incited the God-fearing
women of high standing and the leading
men of the city. They stirred up
persecution against Paul and Barnabas,
and expelled them from their region.
51So they shook the dust from their feet
in protest against them and went to
Iconium.
52And the disciples were filled with joy
and with the Holy Spirit.
14At Iconium Paul and Barnabas
went as usual into the Jewish
synagogue. There they spoke so
effectively that a great number of Jews
and Gentiles believed.
2But the Jews who refused to believe
stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned
their minds against the brothers.
3So Paul and Barnabas spent
considerable time there, speaking boldly
for the Lord, who confirmed the
message of his grace by enabling them
to do miraculous signs and wonders.
4The people of the city were divided;
some sided with the Jews, others with
the apostles.
5There was a plot afoot among the
Gentiles and Jews, together with their
leaders, to mistreat them and stone
them.
6But they found out about it and fled to
the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe
and to the surrounding country,
7where they continued to preach the
good news.
8In Lystra there sat a man crippled in his
feet, who was lame from birth and had
never walked.
9He listened to Paul as he was speaking.
Paul looked directly at him, saw that he
had faith to be healed
10and called out, "Stand up on your
feet!" At that, the man jumped up and
began to walk.
11When the crowd saw what Paul had
done, they shouted in the Lycaonian
language, "The gods have come down
to us in human form!"
12Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul
they called Hermes because he was the
chief speaker.
13The priest of Zeus, whose temple was
just outside the city, brought bulls and
wreaths to the city gates because he
and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices
to them.
14But when the apostles Barnabas and
Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes
and rushed out into the crowd, shouting:
15"Men, why are you doing this? We too
are only men, human like you. We are
bringing you good news, telling you to
turn from these worthless things to the
living God, who made heaven and earth
and sea and everything in them.
16In the past, he let all nations go their
own way.
17Yet he has not left himself without
testimony: He has shown kindness by
giving you rain from heaven and crops
in their seasons; he provides you with
plenty of food and fills your hearts with
joy."
18Even with these words, they had
difficulty keeping the crowd from
sacrificing to them.
19Then some Jews came from Antioch
and Iconium and won the crowd over.
They stoned Paul and dragged him
outside the city, thinking he was dead.
20But after the disciples had gathered
around him, he got up and went back
into the city. The next day he and
Barnabas left for Derbe.
21They preached the good news in that
city and won a large number of disciples.
Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium
and Antioch,
22strengthening the disciples and
encouraging them to remain true to the
faith. "We must go through many
hardships to enter the kingdom of God,"
they said.
23Paul and Barnabas appointed elders
for them in each church and, with prayer
and fasting, committed them to the Lord,
in whom they had put their trust.
24After going through Pisidia, they came
into Pamphylia,
25and when they had preached the word
in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
26From Attalia they sailed back to
Antioch, where they had been
committed to the grace of God for the
work they had now completed.
27On arriving there, they gathered the
church together and reported all that
God had done through them and how he
had opened the door of faith to the
Gentiles.
28And they stayed there a long time with
the disciples.
15Some men came down from
Judea to Antioch and were teaching the
brothers: "Unless you are circumcised,
according to the custom taught by
Moses, you cannot be saved."
2This brought Paul and Barnabas into
sharp dispute and debate with them. So
Paul and Barnabas were appointed,
along with some other believers, to go
up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and
elders about this question.
3The church sent them on their way, and
as they traveled through Phoenicia and
Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had
been converted. This news made all the
brothers very glad.
4When they came to Jerusalem, they
were welcomed by the church and the
apostles and elders, to whom they
reported everything God had done
through them.
5Then some of the believers who
belonged to the party of the Pharisees
stood up and said, "The Gentiles must
be circumcised and required to obey the
law of Moses."
6The apostles and elders met to
consider this question.
7After much discussion, Peter got up
and addressed them: "Brothers, you
know that some time ago God made a
choice among you that the Gentiles
might hear from my lips the message of
the gospel and believe.
8God, who knows the heart, showed that
he accepted them by giving the Holy
Spirit to them, just as he did to us.
9He made no distinction between us and
them, for he purified their hearts by faith.
10Now then, why do you try to test God
by putting on the necks of the disciples
a yoke that neither we nor our fathers
have been able to bear?
11No! We believe it is through the grace
of our Lord Jesus that we are saved,
just as they are."
12The whole assembly became silent as
they listened to Barnabas and Paul
telling about the miraculous signs and
wonders God had done among the
Gentiles through them.
13When they finished, James spoke up:
"Brothers, listen to me.
14Simon has described to us how God at
first showed his concern by taking from
the Gentiles a people for himself.
15The words of the prophets are in
agreement with this, as it is written:
16" 'After this I will return and rebuild
David's fallen tent. Its ruins I will rebuild,
and I will restore it,
17that the remnant of men may seek the
Lord, and all the Gentiles who bear my
name, says the Lord, who does these
things'
18that have been known for ages.
19"It is my judgment, therefore, that we
should not make it difficult for the
Gentiles who are turning to God.
20Instead we should write to them, telling
them to abstain from food polluted by
idols, from sexual immorality, from the
meat of strangled animals and from
blood.
21For Moses has been preached in
every city from the earliest times and is
read in the synagogues on every
Sabbath."
22Then the apostles and elders, with the
whole church, decided to choose some
of their own men and send them to
Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They
chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and
Silas, two men who were leaders among
the brothers.
23With them they sent the following
letter: The apostles and elders, your
brothers, To the Gentile believers in
Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings.
24We have heard that some went out
from us without our authorization and
disturbed you, troubling your minds by
what they said.
25So we all agreed to choose some men
and send them to you with our dear
friends Barnabas and Paul--
26men who have risked their lives for the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
27Therefore we are sending Judas and
Silas to confirm by word of mouth what
we are writing.
28It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and
to us not to burden you with anything
beyond the following requirements:
29You are to abstain from food sacrificed
to idols, from blood, from the meat of
strangled animals and from sexual
immorality. You will do well to avoid
these things. Farewell.
30The men were sent off and went down
to Antioch, where they gathered the
church together and delivered the letter.
31The people read it and were glad for
its encouraging message.
32Judas and Silas, who themselves were
prophets, said much to encourage and
strengthen the brothers.
33After spending some time there, they
were sent off by the brothers with the
blessing of peace to return to those who
had sent them.
35But Paul and Barnabas remained in
Antioch, where they and many others
taught and preached the word of the
Lord.
36Some time later Paul said to Barnabas,
"Let us go back and visit the brothers in
all the towns where we preached the
word of the Lord and see how they are
doing."
37Barnabas wanted to take John, also
called Mark, with them,
38but Paul did not think it wise to take
him, because he had deserted them in
Pamphylia and had not continued with
them in the work.
39They had such a sharp disagreement
that they parted company. Barnabas
took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,
40but Paul chose Silas and left,
commended by the brothers to the
grace of the Lord.
41He went through Syria and Cilicia,
strengthening the churches.
16He came to Derbe and then to
Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy
lived, whose mother was a Jewess and
a believer, but whose father was a
Greek.
2The brothers at Lystra and Iconium
spoke well of him.
3Paul wanted to take him along on the
journey, so he circumcised him because
of the Jews who lived in that area, for
they all knew that his father was a
Greek.
4As they traveled from town to town,
they delivered the decisions reached by
the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for
the people to obey.
5So the churches were strengthened in
the faith and grew daily in numbers.
6Paul and his companions traveled
throughout the region of Phrygia and
Galatia, having been kept by the Holy
Spirit from preaching the word in the
province of Asia.
7When they came to the border of Mysia,
they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit
of Jesus would not allow them to.
8So they passed by Mysia and went
down to Troas.
9During the night Paul had a vision of a
man of Macedonia standing and
begging him, "Come over to Macedonia
and help us."
10After Paul had seen the vision, we got
ready at once to leave for Macedonia,
concluding that God had called us to
preach the gospel to them.
11From Troas we put out to sea and
sailed straight for Samothrace, and the
next day on to Neapolis.
12From there we traveled to Philippi, a
Roman colony and the leading city of
that district of Macedonia. And we
stayed there several days.
13On the Sabbath we went outside the
city gate to the river, where we expected
to find a place of prayer. We sat down
and began to speak to the women who
had gathered there.
14One of those listening was a woman
named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth
from the city of Thyatira, who was a
worshiper of God. The Lord opened her
heart to respond to Paul's message.
15When she and the members of her
household were baptized, she invited us
to her home. "If you consider me a
believer in the Lord," she said, "come
and stay at my house." And she
persuaded us.
16Once when we were going to the place
of prayer, we were met by a slave girl
who had a spirit by which she predicted
the future. She earned a great deal of
money for her owners by fortune-telling.
17This girl followed Paul and the rest of
us, shouting, "These men are servants
of the Most High God, who are telling
you the way to be saved."
18She kept this up for many days. Finally
Paul became so troubled that he turned
around and said to the spirit, "In the
name of Jesus Christ I command you to
come out of her!" At that moment the
spirit left her.
19When the owners of the slave girl
realized that their hope of making
money was gone, they seized Paul and
Silas and dragged them into the
marketplace to face the authorities.
20They brought them before the
magistrates and said, "These men are
Jews, and are throwing our city into an
uproar
21by advocating customs unlawful for us
Romans to accept or practice."
22The crowd joined in the attack against
Paul and Silas, and the magistrates
ordered them to be stripped and beaten.
23After they had been severely flogged,
they were thrown into prison, and the
jailer was commanded to guard them
carefully.
24Upon receiving such orders, he put
them in the inner cell and fastened their
feet in the stocks.
25About midnight Paul and Silas were
praying and singing hymns to God, and
the other prisoners were listening to
them.
26Suddenly there was such a violent
earthquake that the foundations of the
prison were shaken. At once all the
prison doors flew open, and everybody's
chains came loose.
27The jailer woke up, and when he saw
the prison doors open, he drew his
sword and was about to kill himself
because he thought the prisoners had
escaped.
28But Paul shouted, "Don't harm
yourself! We are all here!"
29The jailer called for lights, rushed in
and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.
30He then brought them out and asked,
"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
31They replied, "Believe in the Lord
Jesus, and you will be saved--you and
your household."
32Then they spoke the word of the Lord
to him and to all the others in his house.
33At that hour of the night the jailer took
them and washed their wounds; then
immediately he and all his family were
baptized.
34The jailer brought them into his house
and set a meal before them; he was
filled with joy because he had come to
believe in God--he and his whole family.
35When it was daylight, the magistrates
sent their officers to the jailer with the
order: "Release those men."
36The jailer told Paul, "The magistrates
have ordered that you and Silas be
released. Now you can leave. Go in
peace."
37But Paul said to the officers: "They
beat us publicly without a trial, even
though we are Roman citizens, and
threw us into prison. And now do they
want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let
them come themselves and escort us
out."
38The officers reported this to the
magistrates, and when they heard that
Paul and Silas were Roman citizens,
they were alarmed.
39They came to appease them and
escorted them from the prison,
requesting them to leave the city.
40After Paul and Silas came out of the
prison, they went to Lydia's house,
where they met with the brothers and
encouraged them. Then they left.
17When they had passed through
Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to
Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish
synagogue.
2As his custom was, Paul went into the
synagogue, and on three Sabbath days
he reasoned with them from the
Scriptures,
3explaining and proving that the Christ
had to suffer and rise from the dead.
"This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is
the Christ, " he said.
4Some of the Jews were persuaded and
joined Paul and Silas, as did a large
number of God-fearing Greeks and not
a few prominent women.
5But the Jews were jealous; so they
rounded up some bad characters from
the marketplace, formed a mob and
started a riot in the city. They rushed to
Jason's house in search of Paul and
Silas in order to bring them out to the
crowd.
6But when they did not find them, they
dragged Jason and some other brothers
before the city officials, shouting: "These
men who have caused trouble all over
the world have now come here,
7and Jason has welcomed them into his
house. They are all defying Caesar's
decrees, saying that there is another
king, one called Jesus."
8When they heard this, the crowd and
the city officials were thrown into turmoil.
9Then they made Jason and the others
post bond and let them go.
10As soon as it was night, the brothers
sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On
arriving there, they went to the Jewish
synagogue.
11Now the Bereans were of more noble
character than the Thessalonians, for
they received the message with great
eagerness and examined the Scriptures
every day to see if what Paul said was
true.
12Many of the Jews believed, as did also
a number of prominent Greek women
and many Greek men.
13When the Jews in Thessalonica
learned that Paul was preaching the
word of God at Berea, they went there
too, agitating the crowds and stirring
them up.
14The brothers immediately sent Paul to
the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed
at Berea.
15The men who escorted Paul brought
him to Athens and then left with
instructions for Silas and Timothy to join
him as soon as possible.
16While Paul was waiting for them in
Athens, he was greatly distressed to see
that the city was full of idols.
17So he reasoned in the synagogue with
the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks,
as well as in the marketplace day by day
with those who happened to be there.
18A group of Epicurean and Stoic
philosophers began to dispute with him.
Some of them asked, "What is this
babbler trying to say?" Others remarked,
"He seems to be advocating foreign
gods." They said this because Paul was
preaching the good news about Jesus
and the resurrection.
19Then they took him and brought him to
a meeting of the Areopagus, where they
said to him, "May we know what this
new teaching is that you are presenting?
20You are bringing some strange ideas
to our ears, and we want to know what
they mean."
21(All the Athenians and the foreigners
who lived there spent their time doing
nothing but talking about and listening to
the latest ideas.)
22Paul then stood up in the meeting of
the Areopagus and said: "Men of
Athens! I see that in every way you are
very religious.
23For as I walked around and looked
carefully at your objects of worship, I
even found an altar with this inscription:
24"The God who made the world and
everything in it is the Lord of heaven
and earth and does not live in temples
built by hands.
25And he is not served by human hands,
as if he needed anything, because he
himself gives all men life and breath and
everything else.
26From one man he made every nation
of men, that they should inhabit the
whole earth; and he determined the
times set for them and the exact places
where they should live.
27God did this so that men would seek
him and perhaps reach out for him and
find him, though he is not far from each
one of us.
28'For in him we live and move and have
our being.' As some of your own poets
have said, 'We are his offspring.'
29"Therefore since we are God's
offspring, we should not think that the
divine being is like gold or silver or
stone--an image made by man's design
and skill.
30In the past God overlooked such
ignorance, but now he commands all
people everywhere to repent.
31For he has set a day when he will
judge the world with justice by the man
he has appointed. He has given proof of
this to all men by raising him from the
dead."
32When they heard about the
resurrection of the dead, some of them
sneered, but others said, "We want to
hear you again on this subject."
33At that, Paul left the Council.
34A few men became followers of Paul
and believed. Among them was
Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus,
also a woman named Damaris, and a
number of others.
18After this, Paul left Athens and
went to Corinth.
2There he met a Jew named Aquila, a
native of Pontus, who had recently
come from Italy with his wife Priscilla,
because Claudius had ordered all the
Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see
them,
3and because he was a tentmaker as
they were, he stayed and worked with
them.
4Every Sabbath he reasoned in the
synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and
Greeks.
5When Silas and Timothy came from
Macedonia, Paul devoted himself
exclusively to preaching, testifying to the
Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
6But when the Jews opposed Paul and
became abusive, he shook out his
clothes in protest and said to them,
"Your blood be on your own heads! I am
clear of my responsibility. From now on I
will go to the Gentiles."
7Then Paul left the synagogue and went
next door to the house of Titius Justus,
a worshiper of God.
8Crispus, the synagogue ruler, and his
entire household believed in the Lord;
and many of the Corinthians who heard
him believed and were baptized.
9One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a
vision: "Do not be afraid; keep on
speaking, do not be silent.
10For I am with you, and no one is going
to attack and harm you, because I have
many people in this city."
11So Paul stayed for a year and a half,
teaching them the word of God.
12While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia,
the Jews made a united attack on Paul
and brought him into court.
13"This man," they charged, "is
persuading the people to worship God in
ways contrary to the law."
14Just as Paul was about to speak,
Gallio said to the Jews, "If you Jews
were making a complaint about some
misdemeanor or serious crime, it would
be reasonable for me to listen to you.
15But since it involves questions about
words and names and your own law--
settle the matter yourselves. I will not be
a judge of such things."
16So he had them ejected from the court.
17Then they all turned on Sosthenes the
synagogue ruler and beat him in front of
the court. But Gallio showed no concern
whatever.
18Paul stayed on in Corinth for some
time. Then he left the brothers and
sailed for Syria, accompanied by
Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he
had his hair cut off at Cenchrea because
of a vow he had taken.
19They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul
left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went
into the synagogue and reasoned with
the Jews.
20When they asked him to spend more
time with them, he declined.
21But as he left, he promised, "I will
come back if it is God's will." Then he
set sail from Ephesus.
22When he landed at Caesarea, he went
up and greeted the church and then
went down to Antioch.
23After spending some time in Antioch,
Paul set out from there and traveled
from place to place throughout the
region of Galatia and Phrygia,
strengthening all the disciples.
24Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a
native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus.
He was a learned man, with a thorough
knowledge of the Scriptures.
25He had been instructed in the way of
the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor
and taught about Jesus accurately,
though he knew only the baptism of
John.
26He began to speak boldly in the
synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila
heard him, they invited him to their
home and explained to him the way of
God more adequately.
27When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia,
the brothers encouraged him and wrote
to the disciples there to welcome him.
On arriving, he was a great help to
those who by grace had believed.
28For he vigorously refuted the Jews in
public debate, proving from the
Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
19While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
took the road through the interior and
arrived at Ephesus. There he found
some disciples
2and asked them, "Did you receive the
Holy Spirit when you believed?" They
answered, "No, we have not even heard
that there is a Holy Spirit."
3So Paul asked, "Then what baptism did
you receive?" "John's baptism," they
replied.
4Paul said, "John's baptism was a
baptism of repentance. He told the
people to believe in the one coming
after him, that is, in Jesus."
5On hearing this, they were baptized into
the name of the Lord Jesus.
6When Paul placed his hands on them,
the Holy Spirit came on them, and they
spoke in tongues and prophesied.
7There were about twelve men in all.
8Paul entered the synagogue and spoke
boldly there for three months, arguing
persuasively about the kingdom of God.
9But some of them became obstinate;
they refused to believe and publicly
maligned the Way. So Paul left them.
He took the disciples with him and had
discussions daily in the lecture hall of
Tyrannus.
10This went on for two years, so that all
the Jews and Greeks who lived in the
province of Asia heard the word of the
Lord.
11God did extraordinary miracles
through Paul,
12so that even handkerchiefs and aprons
that had touched him were taken to the
sick, and their illnesses were cured and
the evil spirits left them.
13Some Jews who went around driving
out evil spirits tried to invoke the name
of the Lord Jesus over those who were
demon-possessed. They would say, "In
the name of Jesus, whom Paul
preaches, I command you to come out."
14Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief
priest, were doing this.
15One day the evil spirit answered them,
"Jesus I know, and I know about Paul,
but who are you?"
16Then the man who had the evil spirit
jumped on them and overpowered them
all. He gave them such a beating that
they ran out of the house naked and
bleeding.
17When this became known to the Jews
and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were
all seized with fear, and the name of the
Lord Jesus was held in high honor.
18Many of those who believed now came
and openly confessed their evil deeds.
19A number who had practiced sorcery
brought their scrolls together and
burned them publicly. When they
calculated the value of the scrolls, the
total came to fifty thousand drachmas.
20In this way the word of the Lord spread
widely and grew in power.
21After all this had happened, Paul
decided to go to Jerusalem, passing
through Macedonia and Achaia. "After I
have been there," he said, "I must visit
Rome also."
22He sent two of his helpers, Timothy
and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he
stayed in the province of Asia a little
longer.
23About that time there arose a great
disturbance about the Way.
24A silversmith named Demetrius, who
made silver shrines of Artemis, brought
in no little business for the craftsmen.
25He called them together, along with
the workmen in related trades, and said:
"Men, you know we receive a good
income from this business.
26And you see and hear how this fellow
Paul has convinced and led astray large
numbers of people here in Ephesus and
in practically the whole province of Asia.
He says that man-made gods are no
gods at all.
27There is danger not only that our trade
will lose its good name, but also that the
temple of the great goddess Artemis will
be discredited, and the goddess herself,
who is worshiped throughout the
province of Asia and the world, will be
robbed of her divine majesty."
28When they heard this, they were
furious and began shouting: "Great is
Artemis of the Ephesians!"
29Soon the whole city was in an uproar.
The people seized Gaius and
Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions
from Macedonia, and rushed as one
man into the theater.
30Paul wanted to appear before the
crowd, but the disciples would not let
him.
31Even some of the officials of the
province, friends of Paul, sent him a
message begging him not to venture
into the theater.
32The assembly was in confusion: Some
were shouting one thing, some another.
Most of the people did not even know
why they were there.
33The Jews pushed Alexander to the
front, and some of the crowd shouted
instructions to him. He motioned for
silence in order to make a defense
before the people.
34But when they realized he was a Jew,
they all shouted in unison for about two
hours: "Great is Artemis of the
Ephesians!"
35The city clerk quieted the crowd and
said: "Men of Ephesus, doesn't all the
world know that the city of Ephesus is
the guardian of the temple of the great
Artemis and of her image, which fell
from heaven?
36Therefore, since these facts are
undeniable, you ought to be quiet and
not do anything rash.
37You have brought these men here,
though they have neither robbed
temples nor blasphemed our goddess.
38If, then, Demetrius and his fellow
craftsmen have a grievance against
anybody, the courts are open and there
are proconsuls. They can press charges.
39If there is anything further you want to
bring up, it must be settled in a legal
assembly.
40As it is, we are in danger of being
charged with rioting because of today's
events. In that case we would not be
able to account for this commotion,
since there is no reason for it."
41After he had said this, he dismissed
the assembly.
20When the uproar had ended, Paul
sent for the disciples and, after
encouraging them, said good-by and set
out for Macedonia.
2He traveled through that area, speaking
many words of encouragement to the
people, and finally arrived in Greece,
3where he stayed three months.
Because the Jews made a plot against
him just as he was about to sail for Syria,
he decided to go back through
Macedonia.
4He was accompanied by Sopater son
of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and
Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius
from Derbe, Timothy also, and Tychicus
and Trophimus from the province of
Asia.
5These men went on ahead and waited
for us at Troas.
6But we sailed from Philippi after the
Feast of Unleavened Bread, and five
days later joined the others at Troas,
where we stayed seven days.
7On the first day of the week we came
together to break bread. Paul spoke to
the people and, because he intended to
leave the next day, kept on talking until
midnight.
8There were many lamps in the upstairs
room where we were meeting.
9Seated in a window was a young man
named Eutychus, who was sinking into
a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on.
When he was sound asleep, he fell to
the ground from the third story and was
picked up dead.
10Paul went down, threw himself on the
young man and put his arms around him.
"Don't be alarmed," he said. "He's alive!"
11Then he went upstairs again and
broke bread and ate. After talking until
daylight, he left.
12The people took the young man home
alive and were greatly comforted.
13We went on ahead to the ship and
sailed for Assos, where we were going
to take Paul aboard. He had made this
arrangement because he was going
there on foot.
14When he met us at Assos, we took
him aboard and went on to Mitylene.
15The next day we set sail from there
and arrived off Kios. The day after that
we crossed over to Samos, and on the
following day arrived at Miletus.
16Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus
to avoid spending time in the province of
Asia, for he was in a hurry to reach
Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of
Pentecost.
17From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for
the elders of the church.
18When they arrived, he said to them:
"You know how I lived the whole time I
was with you, from the first day I came
into the province of Asia.
19I served the Lord with great humility
and with tears, although I was severely
tested by the plots of the Jews.
20You know that I have not hesitated to
preach anything that would be helpful to
you but have taught you publicly and
from house to house.
21I have declared to both Jews and
Greeks that they must turn to God in
repentance and have faith in our Lord
Jesus.
22"And now, compelled by the Spirit, I
am going to Jerusalem, not knowing
what will happen to me there.
23I only know that in every city the Holy
Spirit warns me that prison and
hardships are facing me.
24However, I consider my life worth
nothing to me, if only I may finish the
race and complete the task the Lord
Jesus has given me--the task of
testifying to the gospel of God's grace.
25"Now I know that none of you among
whom I have gone about preaching the
kingdom will ever see me again.
26Therefore, I declare to you today that I
am innocent of the blood of all men.
27For I have not hesitated to proclaim to
you the whole will of God.
28Keep watch over yourselves and all
the flock of which the Holy Spirit has
made you overseers. Be shepherds of
the church of God, which he bought with
his own blood.
29I know that after I leave, savage
wolves will come in among you and will
not spare the flock.
30Even from your own number men will
arise and distort the truth in order to
draw away disciples after them.
31So be on your guard! Remember that
for three years I never stopped warning
each of you night and day with tears.
32"Now I commit you to God and to the
word of his grace, which can build you
up and give you an inheritance among
all those who are sanctified.
33I have not coveted anyone's silver or
gold or clothing.
34You yourselves know that these hands
of mine have supplied my own needs
and the needs of my companions.
35In everything I did, I showed you that
by this kind of hard work we must help
the weak, remembering the words the
Lord Jesus himself said: 'It is more
blessed to give than to receive.' "
36When he had said this, he knelt down
with all of them and prayed.
37They all wept as they embraced him
and kissed him.
38What grieved them most was his
statement that they would never see his
face again. Then they accompanied him
to the ship.
21After we had torn ourselves away
from them, we put out to sea and sailed
straight to Cos. The next day we went to
Rhodes and from there to Patara.
2We found a ship crossing over to
Phoenicia, went on board and set sail.
3After sighting Cyprus and passing to
the south of it, we sailed on to Syria. We
landed at Tyre, where our ship was to
unload its cargo.
4Finding the disciples there, we stayed
with them seven days. Through the
Spirit they urged Paul not to go on to
Jerusalem.
5But when our time was up, we left and
continued on our way. All the disciples
and their wives and children
accompanied us out of the city, and
there on the beach we knelt to pray.
6After saying good-by to each other, we
went aboard the ship, and they returned
home.
7We continued our voyage from Tyre
and landed at Ptolemais, where we
greeted the brothers and stayed with
them for a day.
8Leaving the next day, we reached
Caesarea and stayed at the house of
Philip the evangelist, one of the Seven.
9He had four unmarried daughters who
prophesied.
10After we had been there a number of
days, a prophet named Agabus came
down from Judea.
11Coming over to us, he took Paul's belt,
tied his own hands and feet with it and
said, "The Holy Spirit says, 'In this way
the Jews of Jerusalem will bind the
owner of this belt and will hand him over
to the Gentiles.' "
12When we heard this, we and the
people there pleaded with Paul not to go
up to Jerusalem.
13Then Paul answered, "Why are you
weeping and breaking my heart? I am
ready not only to be bound, but also to
die in Jerusalem for the name of the
Lord Jesus."
14When he would not be dissuaded, we
gave up and said, "The Lord's will be
done."
15After this, we got ready and went up to
Jerusalem.
16Some of the disciples from Caesarea
accompanied us and brought us to the
home of Mnason, where we were to stay.
He was a man from Cyprus and one of
the early disciples.
17When we arrived at Jerusalem, the
brothers received us warmly.
18The next day Paul and the rest of us
went to see James, and all the elders
were present.
19Paul greeted them and reported in
detail what God had done among the
Gentiles through his ministry.
20When they heard this, they praised
God. Then they said to Paul: "You see,
brother, how many thousands of Jews
have believed, and all of them are
zealous for the law.
21They have been informed that you
teach all the Jews who live among the
Gentiles to turn away from Moses,
telling them not to circumcise their
children or live according to our customs.
22What shall we do? They will certainly
hear that you have come,
23so do what we tell you. There are four
men with us who have made a vow.
24Take these men, join in their
purification rites and pay their expenses,
so that they can have their heads
shaved. Then everybody will know there
is no truth in these reports about you,
but that you yourself are living in
obedience to the law.
25As for the Gentile believers, we have
written to them our decision that they
should abstain from food sacrificed to
idols, from blood, from the meat of
strangled animals and from sexual
immorality."
26The next day Paul took the men and
purified himself along with them. Then
he went to the temple to give notice of
the date when the days of purification
would end and the offering would be
made for each of them.
27When the seven days were nearly
over, some Jews from the province of
Asia saw Paul at the temple. They
stirred up the whole crowd and seized
him,
28shouting, "Men of Israel, help us! This
is the man who teaches all men
everywhere against our people and our
law and this place. And besides, he has
brought Greeks into the temple area and
defiled this holy place."
29(They had previously seen Trophimus
the Ephesian in the city with Paul and
assumed that Paul had brought him into
the temple area.)
30The whole city was aroused, and the
people came running from all directions.
Seizing Paul, they dragged him from the
temple, and immediately the gates were
shut.
31While they were trying to kill him, news
reached the commander of the Roman
troops that the whole city of Jerusalem
was in an uproar.
32He at once took some officers and
soldiers and ran down to the crowd.
When the rioters saw the commander
and his soldiers, they stopped beating
Paul.
33The commander came up and
arrested him and ordered him to be
bound with two chains. Then he asked
who he was and what he had done.
34Some in the crowd shouted one thing
and some another, and since the
commander could not get at the truth
because of the uproar, he ordered that
Paul be taken into the barracks.
35When Paul reached the steps, the
violence of the mob was so great he had
to be carried by the soldiers.
36The crowd that followed kept shouting,
"Away with him!"
37As the soldiers were about to take
Paul into the barracks, he asked the
commander, "May I say something to
you?"
38"Do you speak Greek?" he replied.
"Aren't you the Egyptian who started a
revolt and led four thousand terrorists
out into the desert some time ago?"
39Paul answered, "I am a Jew, from
Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary
city. Please let me speak to the people."
40Having received the commander's
permission, Paul stood on the steps and
motioned to the crowd. When they were
all silent, he said to them in Aramaic :
22"Brothers and fathers, listen now
to my defense."
2When they heard him speak to them in
Aramaic, they became very quiet.
3Then Paul said: "I am a Jew, born in
Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this
city. Under Gamaliel I was thoroughly
trained in the law of our fathers and was
just as zealous for God as any of you
are today.
4I persecuted the followers of this Way
to their death, arresting both men and
women and throwing them into prison,
5as also the high priest and all the
Council can testify. I even obtained
letters from them to their brothers in
Damascus, and went there to bring
these people as prisoners to Jerusalem
to be punished.
6"About noon as I came near Damascus,
suddenly a bright light from heaven
flashed around me.
7I fell to the ground and heard a voice
say to me, 'Saul! Saul! Why do you
persecute me?'
8" 'Who are you, Lord?' I asked.
9" 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you
are persecuting,' he replied. My
companions saw the light, but they did
not understand the voice of him who
was speaking to me.
10" 'What shall I do, Lord?' I asked.
11" 'Get up,' the Lord said, 'and go into
Damascus. There you will be told all that
you have been assigned to do.' My
companions led me by the hand into
Damascus, because the brilliance of the
light had blinded me.
12"A man named Ananias came to see
me. He was a devout observer of the
law and highly respected by all the Jews
living there.
13He stood beside me and said, 'Brother
Saul, receive your sight!' And at that
very moment I was able to see him.
14"Then he said: 'The God of our fathers
has chosen you to know his will and to
see the Righteous One and to hear
words from his mouth.
15You will be his witness to all men of
what you have seen and heard.
16And now what are you waiting for? Get
up, be baptized and wash your sins
away, calling on his name.'
17"When I returned to Jerusalem and
was praying at the temple, I fell into a
trance
18and saw the Lord speaking. 'Quick!' he
said to me. 'Leave Jerusalem
immediately, because they will not
accept your testimony about me.'
19" 'Lord,' I replied, 'these men know that
I went from one synagogue to another to
imprison and beat those who believe in
you.
20And when the blood of your martyr
Stephen was shed, I stood there giving
my approval and guarding the clothes of
those who were killing him.'
21"Then the Lord said to me, 'Go; I will
send you far away to the Gentiles.' "
22The crowd listened to Paul until he
said this. Then they raised their voices
and shouted, "Rid the earth of him! He's
not fit to live!"
23As they were shouting and throwing off
their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,
24the commander ordered Paul to be
taken into the barracks. He directed that
he be flogged and questioned in order to
find out why the people were shouting at
him like this.
25As they stretched him out to flog him,
Paul said to the centurion standing there,
"Is it legal for you to flog a Roman
citizen who hasn't even been found
guilty?"
26When the centurion heard this, he
went to the commander and reported it.
"What are you going to do?" he asked.
"This man is a Roman citizen."
27The commander went to Paul and
asked, "Tell me, are you a Roman
citizen?" "Yes, I am," he answered.
28Then the commander said, "I had to
pay a big price for my citizenship." "But I
was born a citizen," Paul replied.
29Those who were about to question him
withdrew immediately. The commander
himself was alarmed when he realized
that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen,
in chains.
30The next day, since the commander
wanted to find out exactly why Paul was
being accused by the Jews, he released
him and ordered the chief priests and all
the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he
brought Paul and had him stand before
them.
23Paul looked straight at the
Sanhedrin and said, "My brothers, I
have fulfilled my duty to God in all good
conscience to this day."
2At this the high priest Ananias ordered
those standing near Paul to strike him
on the mouth.
3Then Paul said to him, "God will strike
you, you whitewashed wall! You sit
there to judge me according to the law,
yet you yourself violate the law by
commanding that I be struck!"
4Those who were standing near Paul
said, "You dare to insult God's high
priest?"
5Paul replied, "Brothers, I did not realize
that he was the high priest; for it is
written: 'Do not speak evil about the
ruler of your people.' "
6Then Paul, knowing that some of them
were Sadducees and the others
Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin,
"My brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son
of a Pharisee. I stand on trial because of
my hope in the resurrection of the
dead."
7When he said this, a dispute broke out
between the Pharisees and the
Sadducees, and the assembly was
divided.
8(The Sadducees say that there is no
resurrection, and that there are neither
angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees
acknowledge them all.)
9There was a great uproar, and some of
the teachers of the law who were
Pharisees stood up and argued
vigorously. "We find nothing wrong with
this man," they said. "What if a spirit or
an angel has spoken to him?"
10The dispute became so violent that the
commander was afraid Paul would be
torn to pieces by them. He ordered the
troops to go down and take him away
from them by force and bring him into
the barracks.
11The following night the Lord stood
near Paul and said, "Take courage! As
you have testified about me in
Jerusalem, so you must also testify in
Rome."
12The next morning the Jews formed a
conspiracy and bound themselves with
an oath not to eat or drink until they had
killed Paul.
13More than forty men were involved in
this plot.
14They went to the chief priests and
elders and said, "We have taken a
solemn oath not to eat anything until we
have killed Paul.
15Now then, you and the Sanhedrin
petition the commander to bring him
before you on the pretext of wanting
more accurate information about his
case. We are ready to kill him before he
gets here."
16But when the son of Paul's sister
heard of this plot, he went into the
barracks and told Paul.
17Then Paul called one of the centurions
and said, "Take this young man to the
commander; he has something to tell
him."
18So he took him to the commander.
The centurion said, "Paul, the prisoner,
sent for me and asked me to bring this
young man to you because he has
something to tell you."
19The commander took the young man
by the hand, drew him aside and asked,
"What is it you want to tell me?"
20He said: "The Jews have agreed to
ask you to bring Paul before the
Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of
wanting more accurate information
about him.
21Don't give in to them, because more
than forty of them are waiting in ambush
for him. They have taken an oath not to
eat or drink until they have killed him.
They are ready now, waiting for your
consent to their request."
22The commander dismissed the young
man and cautioned him, "Don't tell
anyone that you have reported this to
me."
23Then he called two of his centurions
and ordered them, "Get ready a
detachment of two hundred soldiers,
seventy horsemen and two hundred
spearmen to go to Caesarea at nine
tonight.
24Provide mounts for Paul so that he
may be taken safely to Governor Felix."
25He wrote a letter as follows:
26Claudius Lysias, To His Excellency,
Governor Felix: Greetings.
27This man was seized by the Jews and
they were about to kill him, but I came
with my troops and rescued him, for I
had learned that he is a Roman citizen.
28I wanted to know why they were
accusing him, so I brought him to their
Sanhedrin.
29I found that the accusation had to do
with questions about their law, but there
was no charge against him that
deserved death or imprisonment.
30When I was informed of a plot to be
carried out against the man, I sent him
to you at once. I also ordered his
accusers to present to you their case
against him.
31So the soldiers, carrying out their
orders, took Paul with them during the
night and brought him as far as
Antipatris.
32The next day they let the cavalry go on
with him, while they returned to the
barracks.
33When the cavalry arrived in Caesarea,
they delivered the letter to the governor
and handed Paul over to him.
34The governor read the letter and
asked what province he was from.
Learning that he was from Cilicia,
35he said, "I will hear your case when
your accusers get here." Then he
ordered that Paul be kept under guard in
Herod's palace.
24Five days later the high priest
Ananias went down to Caesarea with
some of the elders and a lawyer named
Tertullus, and they brought their charges
against Paul before the governor.
2When Paul was called in, Tertullus
presented his case before Felix: "We
have enjoyed a long period of peace
under you, and your foresight has
brought about reforms in this nation.
3Everywhere and in every way, most
excellent Felix, we acknowledge this
with profound gratitude.
4But in order not to weary you further, I
would request that you be kind enough
to hear us briefly.
5"We have found this man to be a
troublemaker, stirring up riots among the
Jews all over the world. He is a
ringleader of the Nazarene sect
6and even tried to desecrate the temple;
so we seized him.
8By examining him yourself you will be
able to learn the truth about all these
charges we are bringing against him."
9The Jews joined in the accusation,
asserting that these things were true.
10When the governor motioned for him
to speak, Paul replied: "I know that for a
number of years you have been a judge
over this nation; so I gladly make my
defense.
11You can easily verify that no more
than twelve days ago I went up to
Jerusalem to worship.
12My accusers did not find me arguing
with anyone at the temple, or stirring up
a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere
else in the city.
13And they cannot prove to you the
charges they are now making against
me.
14However, I admit that I worship the
God of our fathers as a follower of the
Way, which they call a sect. I believe
everything that agrees with the Law and
that is written in the Prophets,
15and I have the same hope in God as
these men, that there will be a
resurrection of both the righteous and
the wicked.
16So I strive always to keep my
conscience clear before God and man.
17"After an absence of several years, I
came to Jerusalem to bring my people
gifts for the poor and to present
offerings.
18I was ceremonially clean when they
found me in the temple courts doing this.
There was no crowd with me, nor was I
involved in any disturbance.
19But there are some Jews from the
province of Asia, who ought to be here
before you and bring charges if they
have anything against me.
20Or these who are here should state
what crime they found in me when I
stood before the Sanhedrin--
21unless it was this one thing I shouted
as I stood in their presence: 'It is
concerning the resurrection of the dead
that I am on trial before you today.' "
22Then Felix, who was well acquainted
with the Way, adjourned the
proceedings. "When Lysias the
commander comes," he said, "I will
decide your case."
23He ordered the centurion to keep Paul
under guard but to give him some
freedom and permit his friends to take
care of his needs.
24Several days later Felix came with his
wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He
sent for Paul and listened to him as he
spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.
25As Paul discoursed on righteousness,
self-control and the judgment to come,
Felix was afraid and said, "That's
enough for now! You may leave. When I
find it convenient, I will send for you."
26At the same time he was hoping that
Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent
for him frequently and talked with him.
27When two years had passed, Felix
was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but
because Felix wanted to grant a favor to
the Jews, he left Paul in prison.
25Three days after arriving in the
province, Festus went up from
Caesarea to Jerusalem,
2where the chief priests and Jewish
leaders appeared before him and
presented the charges against Paul.
3They urgently requested Festus, as a
favor to them, to have Paul transferred
to Jerusalem, for they were preparing an
ambush to kill him along the way.
4Festus answered, "Paul is being held at
Caesarea, and I myself am going there
soon.
5Let some of your leaders come with me
and press charges against the man
there, if he has done anything wrong."
6After spending eight or ten days with
them, he went down to Caesarea, and
the next day he convened the court and
ordered that Paul be brought before him.
7When Paul appeared, the Jews who
had come down from Jerusalem stood
around him, bringing many serious
charges against him, which they could
not prove.
8Then Paul made his defense: "I have
done nothing wrong against the law of
the Jews or against the temple or
against Caesar."
9Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor,
said to Paul, "Are you willing to go up to
Jerusalem and stand trial before me
there on these charges?"
10Paul answered: "I am now standing
before Caesar's court, where I ought to
be tried. I have not done any wrong to
the Jews, as you yourself know very
well.
11If, however, I am guilty of doing
anything deserving death, I do not
refuse to die. But if the charges brought
against me by these Jews are not true,
no one has the right to hand me over to
them. I appeal to Caesar!"
12After Festus had conferred with his
council, he declared: "You have
appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will
go!"
13A few days later King Agrippa and
Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their
respects to Festus.
14Since they were spending many days
there, Festus discussed Paul's case with
the king. He said: "There is a man here
whom Felix left as a prisoner.
15When I went to Jerusalem, the chief
priests and elders of the Jews brought
charges against him and asked that he
be condemned.
16"I told them that it is not the Roman
custom to hand over any man before he
has faced his accusers and has had an
opportunity to defend himself against
their charges.
17When they came here with me, I did
not delay the case, but convened the
court the next day and ordered the man
to be brought in.
18When his accusers got up to speak,
they did not charge him with any of the
crimes I had expected.
19Instead, they had some points of
dispute with him about their own religion
and about a dead man named Jesus
who Paul claimed was alive.
20I was at a loss how to investigate such
matters; so I asked if he would be willing
to go to Jerusalem and stand trial there
on these charges.
21When Paul made his appeal to be held
over for the Emperor's decision, I
ordered him held until I could send him
to Caesar."
22Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I would
like to hear this man myself." He replied,
"Tomorrow you will hear him."
23The next day Agrippa and Bernice
came with great pomp and entered the
audience room with the high ranking
officers and the leading men of the city.
At the command of Festus, Paul was
brought in.
24Festus said: "King Agrippa, and all
who are present with us, you see this
man! The whole Jewish community has
petitioned me about him in Jerusalem
and here in Caesarea, shouting that he
ought not to live any longer.
25I found he had done nothing deserving
of death, but because he made his
appeal to the Emperor I decided to send
him to Rome.
26But I have nothing definite to write to
His Majesty about him. Therefore I have
brought him before all of you, and
especially before you, King Agrippa, so
that as a result of this investigation I
may have something to write.
27For I think it is unreasonable to send
on a prisoner without specifying the
charges against him."
26Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You
have permission to speak for yourself."
So Paul motioned with his hand and
began his defense:
2"King Agrippa, I consider myself
fortunate to stand before you today as I
make my defense against all the
accusations of the Jews,
3and especially so because you are well
acquainted with all the Jewish customs
and controversies. Therefore, I beg you
to listen to me patiently.
4"The Jews all know the way I have lived
ever since I was a child, from the
beginning of my life in my own country,
and also in Jerusalem.
5They have known me for a long time
and can testify, if they are willing, that
according to the strictest sect of our
religion, I lived as a Pharisee.
6And now it is because of my hope in
what God has promised our fathers that
I am on trial today.
7This is the promise our twelve tribes
are hoping to see fulfilled as they
earnestly serve God day and night. O
king, it is because of this hope that the
Jews are accusing me.
8Why should any of you consider it
incredible that God raises the dead?
9"I too was convinced that I ought to do
all that was possible to oppose the
name of Jesus of Nazareth.
10And that is just what I did in Jerusalem.
On the authority of the chief priests I put
many of the saints in prison, and when
they were put to death, I cast my vote
against them.
11Many a time I went from one
synagogue to another to have them
punished, and I tried to force them to
blaspheme. In my obsession against
them, I even went to foreign cities to
persecute them.
12"On one of these journeys I was going
to Damascus with the authority and
commission of the chief priests.
13About noon, O king, as I was on the
road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter
than the sun, blazing around me and my
companions.
14We all fell to the ground, and I heard a
voice saying to me in Aramaic, 'Saul,
Saul, why do you persecute me? It is
hard for you to kick against the goads.'
15"Then I asked, 'Who are you, Lord?'
16" 'I am Jesus, whom you are
persecuting,' the Lord replied. 'Now get
up and stand on your feet. I have
appeared to you to appoint you as a
servant and as a witness of what you
have seen of me and what I will show
you.
17I will rescue you from your own people
and from the Gentiles. I am sending you
to them
18to open their eyes and turn them from
darkness to light, and from the power of
Satan to God, so that they may receive
forgiveness of sins and a place among
those who are sanctified by faith in me.'
19"So then, King Agrippa, I was not
disobedient to the vision from heaven.
20First to those in Damascus, then to
those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and
to the Gentiles also, I preached that they
should repent and turn to God and
prove their repentance by their deeds.
21That is why the Jews seized me in the
temple courts and tried to kill me.
22But I have had God's help to this very
day, and so I stand here and testify to
small and great alike. I am saying
nothing beyond what the prophets and
Moses said would happen--
23that the Christ would suffer and, as the
first to rise from the dead, would
proclaim light to his own people and to
the Gentiles."
24At this point Festus interrupted Paul's
defense. "You are out of your mind,
Paul!" he shouted. "Your great learning
is driving you insane."
25"I am not insane, most excellent
Festus," Paul replied. "What I am saying
is true and reasonable.
26The king is familiar with these things,
and I can speak freely to him. I am
convinced that none of this has escaped
his notice, because it was not done in a
corner.
27King Agrippa, do you believe the
prophets? I know you do."
28Then Agrippa said to Paul, "Do you
think that in such a short time you can
persuade me to be a Christian?"
29Paul replied, "Short time or long--I pray
God that not only you but all who are
listening to me today may become what
I am, except for these chains."
30The king rose, and with him the
governor and Bernice and those sitting
with them.
31They left the room, and while talking
with one another, they said, "This man is
not doing anything that deserves death
or imprisonment."
32Agrippa said to Festus, "This man
could have been set free if he had not
appealed to Caesar."
27When it was decided that we
would sail for Italy, Paul and some other
prisoners were handed over to a
centurion named Julius, who belonged
to the Imperial Regiment.
2We boarded a ship from Adramyttium
about to sail for ports along the coast of
the province of Asia, and we put out to
sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from
Thessalonica, was with us.
3The next day we landed at Sidon; and
Julius, in kindness to Paul, allowed him
to go to his friends so they might provide
for his needs.
4From there we put out to sea again and
passed to the lee of Cyprus because the
winds were against us.
5When we had sailed across the open
sea off the coast of Cilicia and
Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.
6There the centurion found an
Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put
us on board.
7We made slow headway for many days
and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus.
When the wind did not allow us to hold
our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete,
opposite Salmone.
8We moved along the coast with
difficulty and came to a place called Fair
Havens, near the town of Lasea.
9Much time had been lost, and sailing
had already become dangerous
because by now it was after the Fast.
So Paul warned them,
10"Men, I can see that our voyage is
going to be disastrous and bring great
loss to ship and cargo, and to our own
lives also."
11But the centurion, instead of listening
to what Paul said, followed the advice of
the pilot and of the owner of the ship.
12Since the harbor was unsuitable to
winter in, the majority decided that we
should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix
and winter there. This was a harbor in
Crete, facing both southwest and
northwest.
13When a gentle south wind began to
blow, they thought they had obtained
what they wanted; so they weighed
anchor and sailed along the shore of
Crete.
14Before very long, a wind of hurricane
force, called the "northeaster," swept
down from the island.
15The ship was caught by the storm and
could not head into the wind; so we
gave way to it and were driven along.
16As we passed to the lee of a small
island called Cauda, we were hardly
able to make the lifeboat secure.
17When the men had hoisted it aboard,
they passed ropes under the ship itself
to hold it together. Fearing that they
would run aground on the sandbars of
Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and
let the ship be driven along.
18We took such a violent battering from
the storm that the next day they began
to throw the cargo overboard.
19On the third day, they threw the ship's
tackle overboard with their own hands.
20When neither sun nor stars appeared
for many days and the storm continued
raging, we finally gave up all hope of
being saved.
21After the men had gone a long time
without food, Paul stood up before them
and said: "Men, you should have taken
my advice not to sail from Crete; then
you would have spared yourselves this
damage and loss.
22But now I urge you to keep up your
courage, because not one of you will be
lost; only the ship will be destroyed.
23Last night an angel of the God whose I
am and whom I serve stood beside me
24and said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul. You
must stand trial before Caesar; and God
has graciously given you the lives of all
who sail with you.'
25So keep up your courage, men, for I
have faith in God that it will happen just
as he told me.
26Nevertheless, we must run aground on
some island."
27On the fourteenth night we were still
being driven across the Adriatic Sea,
when about midnight the sailors sensed
they were approaching land.
28They took soundings and found that
the water was a hundred and twenty
feet deep. A short time later they took
soundings again and found it was ninety
feet deep.
29Fearing that we would be dashed
against the rocks, they dropped four
anchors from the stern and prayed for
daylight.
30In an attempt to escape from the ship,
the sailors let the lifeboat down into the
sea, pretending they were going to
lower some anchors from the bow.
31Then Paul said to the centurion and
the soldiers, "Unless these men stay
with the ship, you cannot be saved."
32So the soldiers cut the ropes that held
the lifeboat and let it fall away.
33Just before dawn Paul urged them all
to eat. "For the last fourteen days," he
said, "you have been in constant
suspense and have gone without food--
you haven't eaten anything.
34Now I urge you to take some food.
You need it to survive. Not one of you
will lose a single hair from his head."
35After he said this, he took some bread
and gave thanks to God in front of them
all. Then he broke it and began to eat.
36They were all encouraged and ate
some food themselves.
37Altogether there were 276 of us on
board.
38When they had eaten as much as they
wanted, they lightened the ship by
throwing the grain into the sea.
39When daylight came, they did not
recognize the land, but they saw a bay
with a sandy beach, where they decided
to run the ship aground if they could.
40Cutting loose the anchors, they left
them in the sea and at the same time
untied the ropes that held the rudders.
Then they hoisted the foresail to the
wind and made for the beach.
41But the ship struck a sandbar and ran
aground. The bow stuck fast and would
not move, and the stern was broken to
pieces by the pounding of the surf.
42The soldiers planned to kill the
prisoners to prevent any of them from
swimming away and escaping.
43But the centurion wanted to spare
Paul's life and kept them from carrying
out their plan. He ordered those who
could swim to jump overboard first and
get to land.
44The rest were to get there on planks or
on pieces of the ship. In this way
everyone reached land in safety.
28Once safely on shore, we found
out that the island was called Malta.
2The islanders showed us unusual
kindness. They built a fire and
welcomed us all because it was raining
and cold.
3Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and,
as he put it on the fire, a viper, driven
out by the heat, fastened itself on his
hand.
4When the islanders saw the snake
hanging from his hand, they said to
each other, "This man must be a
murderer; for though he escaped from
the sea, Justice has not allowed him to
live."
5But Paul shook the snake off into the
fire and suffered no ill effects.
6The people expected him to swell up or
suddenly fall dead, but after waiting a
long time and seeing nothing unusual
happen to him, they changed their
minds and said he was a god.
7There was an estate nearby that
belonged to Publius, the chief official of
the island. He welcomed us to his home
and for three days entertained us
hospitably.
8His father was sick in bed, suffering
from fever and dysentery. Paul went in
to see him and, after prayer, placed his
hands on him and healed him.
9When this had happened, the rest of
the sick on the island came and were
cured.
10They honored us in many ways and
when we were ready to sail, they
furnished us with the supplies we
needed.
11After three months we put out to sea in
a ship that had wintered in the island. It
was an Alexandrian ship with the
figurehead of the twin gods Castor and
Pollux.
12We put in at Syracuse and stayed
there three days.
13From there we set sail and arrived at
Rhegium. The next day the south wind
came up, and on the following day we
reached Puteoli.
14There we found some brothers who
invited us to spend a week with them.
And so we came to Rome.
15The brothers there had heard that we
were coming, and they traveled as far
as the Forum of Appius and the Three
Taverns to meet us. At the sight of these
men Paul thanked God and was
encouraged.
16When we got to Rome, Paul was
allowed to live by himself, with a soldier
to guard him.
17Three days later he called together the
leaders of the Jews. When they had
assembled, Paul said to them: "My
brothers, although I have done nothing
against our people or against the
customs of our ancestors, I was
arrested in Jerusalem and handed over
to the Romans.
18They examined me and wanted to
release me, because I was not guilty of
any crime deserving death.
19But when the Jews objected, I was
compelled to appeal to Caesar--not that
I had any charge to bring against my
own people.
20For this reason I have asked to see
you and talk with you. It is because of
the hope of Israel that I am bound with
this chain."
21They replied, "We have not received
any letters from Judea concerning you,
and none of the brothers who have
come from there has reported or said
anything bad about you.
22But we want to hear what your views
are, for we know that people
everywhere are talking against this
sect."
23They arranged to meet Paul on a
certain day, and came in even larger
numbers to the place where he was
staying. From morning till evening he
explained and declared to them the
kingdom of God and tried to convince
them about Jesus from the Law of
Moses and from the Prophets.
24Some were convinced by what he said,
but others would not believe.
25They disagreed among themselves
and began to leave after Paul had made
this final statement: "The Holy Spirit
spoke the truth to your forefathers when
he said through Isaiah the prophet:
26" 'Go to this people and say, "You will
be ever hearing but never
understanding; you will be ever seeing
but never perceiving."
27For this people's heart has become
calloused; they hardly hear with their
ears, and they have closed their eyes.
Otherwise they might see with their eyes,
hear with their ears, understand with
their hearts and turn, and I would heal
them.'
28"Therefore I want you to know that
God's salvation has been sent to the
Gentiles, and they will listen!"
30For two whole years Paul stayed there
in his own rented house and welcomed
all who came to see him.
31Boldly and without hindrance he
preached the kingdom of God and
taught about the Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans
1Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus,
called to be an apostle and set apart for
the gospel of God--
2the gospel he promised beforehand
through his prophets in the Holy
Scriptures
3regarding his Son, who as to his human
nature was a descendant of David,
4and who through the Spirit of holiness
was declared with power to be the Son
of God by his resurrection from the
dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.
5Through him and for his name's sake,
we received grace and apostleship to
call people from among all the Gentiles
to the obedience that comes from faith.
6And you also are among those who are
called to belong to Jesus Christ.
7To all in Rome who are loved by God
and called to be saints: Grace and
peace to you from God our Father and
from the Lord Jesus Christ.
8First, I thank my God through Jesus
Christ for all of you, because your faith
is being reported all over the world.
9God, whom I serve with my whole heart
in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my
witness how constantly I remember you
10in my prayers at all times; and I pray
that now at last by God's will the way
may be opened for me to come to you.
11I long to see you so that I may impart
to you some spiritual gift to make you
strong--
12that is, that you and I may be mutually
encouraged by each other's faith.
13I do not want you to be unaware,
brothers, that I planned many times to
come to you (but have been prevented
from doing so until now) in order that I
might have a harvest among you, just as
I have had among the other Gentiles.
14I am obligated both to Greeks and
non-Greeks, both to the wise and the
foolish.
15That is why I am so eager to preach
the gospel also to you who are at Rome.
16I am not ashamed of the gospel,
because it is the power of God for the
salvation of everyone who believes: first
for the Jew, then for the Gentile.
17For in the gospel a righteousness from
God is revealed, a righteousness that is
by faith from first to last, just as it is
written: "The righteous will live by faith."
18The wrath of God is being revealed
from heaven against all the godlessness
and wickedness of men who suppress
the truth by their wickedness,
19since what may be known about God
is plain to them, because God has made
it plain to them.
20For since the creation of the world
God's invisible qualities--his eternal
power and divine nature--have been
clearly seen, being understood from
what has been made, so that men are
without excuse.
21For although they knew God, they
neither glorified him as God nor gave
thanks to him, but their thinking became
futile and their foolish hearts were
darkened.
22Although they claimed to be wise, they
became fools
23and exchanged the glory of the
immortal God for images made to look
like mortal man and birds and animals
and reptiles.
24Therefore God gave them over in the
sinful desires of their hearts to sexual
impurity for the degrading of their bodies
with one another.
25They exchanged the truth of God for a
lie, and worshiped and served created
things rather than the Creator--who is
forever praised. Amen.
26Because of this, God gave them over
to shameful lusts. Even their women
exchanged natural relations for
unnatural ones.
27In the same way the men also
abandoned natural relations with women
and were inflamed with lust for one
another. Men committed indecent acts
with other men, and received in
themselves the due penalty for their
perversion.
28Furthermore, since they did not think it
worthwhile to retain the knowledge of
God, he gave them over to a depraved
mind, to do what ought not to be done.
29They have become filled with every
kind of wickedness, evil, greed and
depravity. They are full of envy, murder,
strife, deceit and malice. They are
gossips,
30slanderers, God-haters, insolent,
arrogant and boastful; they invent ways
of doing evil; they disobey their parents;
31they are senseless, faithless, heartless,
ruthless.
32Although they know God's righteous
decree that those who do such things
deserve death, they not only continue to
do these very things but also approve of
those who practice them.
2You, therefore, have no excuse, you
who pass judgment on someone else,
for at whatever point you judge the other,
you are condemning yourself, because
you who pass judgment do the same
things.
2Now we know that God's judgment
against those who do such things is
based on truth.
3So when you, a mere man, pass
judgment on them and yet do the same
things, do you think you will escape
God's judgment?
4Or do you show contempt for the riches
of his kindness, tolerance and patience,
not realizing that God's kindness leads
you toward repentance?
5But because of your stubbornness and
your unrepentant heart, you are storing
up wrath against yourself for the day of
God's wrath, when his righteous
judgment will be revealed.
6God "will give to each person according
to what he has done."
7To those who by persistence in doing
good seek glory, honor and immortality,
he will give eternal life.
8But for those who are self-seeking and
who reject the truth and follow evil, there
will be wrath and anger.
9There will be trouble and distress for
every human being who does evil: first
for the Jew, then for the Gentile;
10but glory, honor and peace for
everyone who does good: first for the
Jew, then for the Gentile.
11For God does not show favoritism.
12All who sin apart from the law will also
perish apart from the law, and all who
sin under the law will be judged by the
law.
13For it is not those who hear the law
who are righteous in God's sight, but it is
those who obey the law who will be
declared righteous.
14(Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not
have the law, do by nature things
required by the law, they are a law for
themselves, even though they do not
have the law,
15since they show that the requirements
of the law are written on their hearts,
their consciences also bearing witness,
and their thoughts now accusing, now
even defending them.)
16This will take place on the day when
God will judge men's secrets through
Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.
17Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if
you rely on the law and brag about your
relationship to God;
18if you know his will and approve of
what is superior because you are
instructed by the law;
19if you are convinced that you are a
guide for the blind, a light for those who
are in the dark,
20an instructor of the foolish, a teacher
of infants, because you have in the law
the embodiment of knowledge and truth-
-
21you, then, who teach others, do you
not teach yourself? You who preach
against stealing, do you steal?
22You who say that people should not
commit adultery, do you commit
adultery? You who abhor idols, do you
rob temples?
23You who brag about the law, do you
dishonor God by breaking the law?
24As it is written: "God's name is
blasphemed among the Gentiles
because of you."
25Circumcision has value if you observe
the law, but if you break the law, you
have become as though you had not
been circumcised.
26If those who are not circumcised keep
the law's requirements, will they not be
regarded as though they were
circumcised?
27The one who is not circumcised
physically and yet obeys the law will
condemn you who, even though you
have the written code and circumcision,
are a lawbreaker.
28A man is not a Jew if he is only one
outwardly, nor is circumcision merely
outward and physical.
29No, a man is a Jew if he is one
inwardly; and circumcision is
circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit,
not by the written code. Such a man's
praise is not from men, but from God.
3What advantage, then, is there in
being a Jew, or what value is there in
circumcision?
2Much in every way! First of all, they
have been entrusted with the very words
of God.
3What if some did not have faith? Will
their lack of faith nullify God's
faithfulness?
4Not at all! Let God be true, and every
man a liar. As it is written: "So that you
may be proved right when you speak
and prevail when you judge."
5But if our unrighteousness brings out
God's righteousness more clearly, what
shall we say? That God is unjust in
bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a
human argument.)
6Certainly not! If that were so, how could
God judge the world?
7Someone might argue, "If my falsehood
enhances God's truthfulness and so
increases his glory, why am I still
condemned as a sinner?"
8Why not say--as we are being
slanderously reported as saying and as
some claim that we say--"Let us do evil
that good may result"? Their
condemnation is deserved.
9What shall we conclude then? Are we
any better ? Not at all! We have already
made the charge that Jews and Gentiles
alike are all under sin.
10As it is written: "There is no one
righteous, not even one;
11there is no one who understands, no
one who seeks God.
12All have turned away, they have
together become worthless; there is no
one who does good, not even one."
13"Their throats are open graves; their
tongues practice deceit." "The poison of
vipers is on their lips."
14"Their mouths are full of cursing and
bitterness."
15"Their feet are swift to shed blood;
16ruin and misery mark their ways,
17and the way of peace they do not
know."
18"There is no fear of God before their
eyes."
19Now we know that whatever the law
says, it says to those who are under the
law, so that every mouth may be
silenced and the whole world held
accountable to God.
20Therefore no one will be declared
righteous in his sight by observing the
law; rather, through the law we become
conscious of sin.
21But now a righteousness from God,
apart from law, has been made known,
to which the Law and the Prophets
testify.
22This righteousness from God comes
through faith in Jesus Christ to all who
believe. There is no difference,
23for all have sinned and fall short of the
glory of God,
24and are justified freely by his grace
through the redemption that came by
Christ Jesus.
25God presented him as a sacrifice of
atonement, through faith in his blood.
He did this to demonstrate his justice,
because in his forbearance he had left
the sins committed beforehand
unpunished--
26he did it to demonstrate his justice at
the present time, so as to be just and
the one who justifies those who have
faith in Jesus.
27Where, then, is boasting? It is
excluded. On what principle? On that of
observing the law? No, but on that of
faith.
28For we maintain that a man is justified
by faith apart from observing the law.
29Is God the God of Jews only? Is he not
the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of
Gentiles too,
30since there is only one God, who will
justify the circumcised by faith and the
uncircumcised through that same faith.
31Do we, then, nullify the law by this
faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the
law.
4What then shall we say that Abraham,
our forefather, discovered in this matter?
2If, in fact, Abraham was justified by
works, he had something to boast
about--but not before God.
3What does the Scripture say?
"Abraham believed God, and it was
credited to him as righteousness."
4Now when a man works, his wages are
not credited to him as a gift, but as an
obligation.
5However, to the man who does not
work but trusts God who justifies the
wicked, his faith is credited as
righteousness.
6David says the same thing when he
speaks of the blessedness of the man to
whom God credits righteousness apart
from works:
7"Blessed are they whose
transgressions are forgiven, whose sins
are covered.
8Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord
will never count against him."
9Is this blessedness only for the
circumcised, or also for the
uncircumcised? We have been saying
that Abraham's faith was credited to him
as righteousness.
10Under what circumstances was it
credited? Was it after he was
circumcised, or before? It was not after,
but before!
11And he received the sign of
circumcision, a seal of the
righteousness that he had by faith while
he was still uncircumcised. So then, he
is the father of all who believe but have
not been circumcised, in order that
righteousness might be credited to them.
12And he is also the father of the
circumcised who not only are
circumcised but who also walk in the
footsteps of the faith that our father
Abraham had before he was
circumcised.
13It was not through law that Abraham
and his offspring received the promise
that he would be heir of the world, but
through the righteousness that comes
by faith.
14For if those who live by law are heirs,
faith has no value and the promise is
worthless,
15because law brings wrath. And where
there is no law there is no transgression.
16Therefore, the promise comes by faith,
so that it may be by grace and may be
guaranteed to all Abraham's offspring--
not only to those who are of the law but
also to those who are of the faith of
Abraham. He is the father of us all.
17As it is written: "I have made you a
father of many nations." He is our father
in the sight of God, in whom he
believed--the God who gives life to the
dead and calls things that are not as
though they were.
18Against all hope, Abraham in hope
believed and so became the father of
many nations, just as it had been said to
him, "So shall your offspring be."
19Without weakening in his faith, he
faced the fact that his body was as good
as dead--since he was about a hundred
years old--and that Sarah's womb was
also dead.
20Yet he did not waver through unbelief
regarding the promise of God, but was
strengthened in his faith and gave glory
to God,
21being fully persuaded that God had
power to do what he had promised.
22This is why "it was credited to him as
righteousness."
23The words "it was credited to him"
were written not for him alone,
24but also for us, to whom God will credit
righteousness--for us who believe in him
who raised Jesus our Lord from the
dead.
25He was delivered over to death for our
sins and was raised to life for our
justification.
5Therefore, since we have been
justified through faith, we have peace
with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
2through whom we have gained access
by faith into this grace in which we now
stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the
glory of God.
3Not only so, but we also rejoice in our
sufferings, because we know that
suffering produces perseverance;
4perseverance, character; and character,
hope.
5And hope does not disappoint us,
because God has poured out his love
into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom
he has given us.
6You see, at just the right time, when we
were still powerless, Christ died for the
ungodly.
7Very rarely will anyone die for a
righteous man, though for a good man
someone might possibly dare to die.
8But God demonstrates his own love for
us in this: While we were still sinners,
Christ died for us.
9Since we have now been justified by
his blood, how much more shall we be
saved from God's wrath through him!
10For if, when we were God's enemies,
we were reconciled to him through the
death of his Son, how much more,
having been reconciled, shall we be
saved through his life!
11Not only is this so, but we also rejoice
in God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
through whom we have now received
reconciliation.
12Therefore, just as sin entered the
world through one man, and death
through sin, and in this way death came
to all men, because all sinned--
13for before the law was given, sin was
in the world. But sin is not taken into
account when there is no law.
14Nevertheless, death reigned from the
time of Adam to the time of Moses, even
over those who did not sin by breaking a
command, as did Adam, who was a
pattern of the one to come.
15But the gift is not like the trespass. For
if the many died by the trespass of the
one man, how much more did God's
grace and the gift that came by the
grace of the one man, Jesus Christ,
overflow to the many!
16Again, the gift of God is not like the
result of the one man's sin: The
judgment followed one sin and brought
condemnation, but the gift followed
many trespasses and brought
justification.
17For if, by the trespass of the one man,
death reigned through that one man,
how much more will those who receive
God's abundant provision of grace and
of the gift of righteousness reign in life
through the one man, Jesus Christ.
18Consequently, just as the result of one
trespass was condemnation for all men,
so also the result of one act of
righteousness was justification that
brings life for all men.
19For just as through the disobedience
of the one man the many were made
sinners, so also through the obedience
of the one man the many will be made
righteous.
20The law was added so that the
trespass might increase. But where sin
increased, grace increased all the more,
21so that, just as sin reigned in death, so
also grace might reign through
righteousness to bring eternal life
through Jesus Christ our Lord.
6What shall we say, then? Shall we go
on sinning so that grace may increase?
2By no means! We died to sin; how can
we live in it any longer?
3Or don't you know that all of us who
were baptized into Christ Jesus were
baptized into his death?
4We were therefore buried with him
through baptism into death in order that,
just as Christ was raised from the dead
through the glory of the Father, we too
may live a new life.
5If we have been united with him like this
in his death, we will certainly also be
united with him in his resurrection.
6For we know that our old self was
crucified with him so that the body of sin
might be done away with, that we
should no longer be slaves to sin--
7because anyone who has died has
been freed from sin.
8Now if we died with Christ, we believe
that we will also live with him.
9For we know that since Christ was
raised from the dead, he cannot die
again; death no longer has mastery over
him.
10The death he died, he died to sin once
for all; but the life he lives, he lives to
God.
11In the same way, count yourselves
dead to sin but alive to God in Christ
Jesus.
12Therefore do not let sin reign in your
mortal body so that you obey its evil
desires.
13Do not offer the parts of your body to
sin, as instruments of wickedness, but
rather offer yourselves to God, as those
who have been brought from death to
life; and offer the parts of your body to
him as instruments of righteousness.
14For sin shall not be your master,
because you are not under law, but
under grace.
15What then? Shall we sin because we
are not under law but under grace? By
no means!
16Don't you know that when you offer
yourselves to someone to obey him as
slaves, you are slaves to the one whom
you obey--whether you are slaves to sin,
which leads to death, or to obedience,
which leads to righteousness?
17But thanks be to God that, though you
used to be slaves to sin, you
wholeheartedly obeyed the form of
teaching to which you were entrusted.
18You have been set free from sin and
have become slaves to righteousness.
19I put this in human terms because you
are weak in your natural selves. Just as
you used to offer the parts of your body
in slavery to impurity and to everincreasing
wickedness, so now offer
them in slavery to righteousness leading
to holiness.
20When you were slaves to sin, you
were free from the control of
righteousness.
21What benefit did you reap at that time
from the things you are now ashamed
of? Those things result in death!
22But now that you have been set free
from sin and have become slaves to
God, the benefit you reap leads to
holiness, and the result is eternal life.
23For the wages of sin is death, but the
gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus
our Lord.
7Do you not know, brothers--for I am
speaking to men who know the law--that
the law has authority over a man only as
long as he lives?
2For example, by law a married woman
is bound to her husband as long as he is
alive, but if her husband dies, she is
released from the law of marriage.
3So then, if she marries another man
while her husband is still alive, she is
called an adulteress. But if her husband
dies, she is released from that law and
is not an adulteress, even though she
marries another man.
4So, my brothers, you also died to the
law through the body of Christ, that you
might belong to another, to him who was
raised from the dead, in order that we
might bear fruit to God.
5For when we were controlled by the
sinful nature, the sinful passions
aroused by the law were at work in our
bodies, so that we bore fruit for death.
6But now, by dying to what once bound
us, we have been released from the law
so that we serve in the new way of the
Spirit, and not in the old way of the
written code.
7What shall we say, then? Is the law
sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not
have known what sin was except
through the law. For I would not have
known what coveting really was if the
law had not said, "Do not covet."
8But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded
by the commandment, produced in me
every kind of covetous desire. For apart
from law, sin is dead.
9Once I was alive apart from law; but
when the commandment came, sin
sprang to life and I died.
10I found that the very commandment
that was intended to bring life actually
brought death.
11For sin, seizing the opportunity
afforded by the commandment,
deceived me, and through the
commandment put me to death.
12So then, the law is holy, and the
commandment is holy, righteous and
good.
13Did that which is good, then, become
death to me? By no means! But in order
that sin might be recognized as sin, it
produced death in me through what was
good, so that through the
commandment sin might become utterly
sinful.
14We know that the law is spiritual; but I
am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.
15I do not understand what I do. For
what I want to do I do not do, but what I
hate I do.
16And if I do what I do not want to do, I
agree that the law is good.
17As it is, it is no longer I myself who do
it, but it is sin living in me.
18I know that nothing good lives in me,
that is, in my sinful nature. For I have
the desire to do what is good, but I
cannot carry it out.
19For what I do is not the good I want to
do; no, the evil I do not want to do--this I
keep on doing.
20Now if I do what I do not want to do, it
is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living
in me that does it.
21So I find this law at work: When I want
to do good, evil is right there with me.
22For in my inner being I delight in God's
law;
23but I see another law at work in the
members of my body, waging war
against the law of my mind and making
me a prisoner of the law of sin at work
within my members.
24What a wretched man I am! Who will
rescue me from this body of death?
25Thanks be to God--through Jesus
Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my
mind am a slave to God's law, but in the
sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.
8Therefore, there is now no
condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus,
2because through Christ Jesus the law
of the Spirit of life set me free from the
law of sin and death.
3For what the law was powerless to do
in that it was weakened by the sinful
nature, God did by sending his own Son
in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin
offering. And so he condemned sin in
sinful man,
4in order that the righteous requirements
of the law might be fully met in us, who
do not live according to the sinful nature
but according to the Spirit.
5Those who live according to the sinful
nature have their minds set on what that
nature desires; but those who live in
accordance with the Spirit have their
minds set on what the Spirit desires.
6The mind of sinful man is death, but the
mind controlled by the Spirit is life and
peace;
7the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does
not submit to God's law, nor can it do so.
8Those controlled by the sinful nature
cannot please God.
9You, however, are controlled not by the
sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit
of God lives in you. And if anyone does
not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not
belong to Christ.
10But if Christ is in you, your body is
dead because of sin, yet your spirit is
alive because of righteousness.
11And if the Spirit of him who raised
Jesus from the dead is living in you, he
who raised Christ from the dead will also
give life to your mortal bodies through
his Spirit, who lives in you.
12Therefore, brothers, we have an
obligation--but it is not to the sinful
nature, to live according to it.
13For if you live according to the sinful
nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit
you put to death the misdeeds of the
body, you will live,
14because those who are led by the
Spirit of God are sons of God.
15For you did not receive a spirit that
makes you a slave again to fear, but you
received the Spirit of sonship. And by
him we cry, "Abba, Father."
16The Spirit himself testifies with our
spirit that we are God's children.
17Now if we are children, then we are
heirs--heirs of God and co-heirs with
Christ, if indeed we share in his
sufferings in order that we may also
share in his glory.
18I consider that our present sufferings
are not worth comparing with the glory
that will be revealed in us.
19The creation waits in eager
expectation for the sons of God to be
revealed.
20For the creation was subjected to
frustration, not by its own choice, but by
the will of the one who subjected it, in
hope
21that the creation itself will be liberated
from its bondage to decay and brought
into the glorious freedom of the children
of God.
22We know that the whole creation has
been groaning as in the pains of
childbirth right up to the present time.
23Not only so, but we ourselves, who
have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan
inwardly as we wait eagerly for our
adoption as sons, the redemption of our
bodies.
24For in this hope we were saved. But
hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who
hopes for what he already has?
25But if we hope for what we do not yet
have, we wait for it patiently.
26In the same way, the Spirit helps us in
our weakness. We do not know what we
ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself
intercedes for us with groans that words
cannot express.
27And he who searches our hearts
knows the mind of the Spirit, because
the Spirit intercedes for the saints in
accordance with God's will.
28And we know that in all things God
works for the good of those who love
him, who have been called according to
his purpose.
29For those God foreknew he also
predestined to be conformed to the
likeness of his Son, that he might be the
firstborn among many brothers.
30And those he predestined, he also
called; those he called, he also justified;
those he justified, he also glorified.
31What, then, shall we say in response
to this? If God is for us, who can be
against us?
32He who did not spare his own Son, but
gave him up for us all--how will he not
also, along with him, graciously give us
all things?
33Who will bring any charge against
those whom God has chosen? It is God
who justifies.
34Who is he that condemns? Christ
Jesus, who died--more than that, who
was raised to life--is at the right hand of
God and is also interceding for us.
35Who shall separate us from the love of
Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or
persecution or famine or nakedness or
danger or sword?
36As it is written: "For your sake we face
death all day long; we are considered as
sheep to be slaughtered."
37No, in all these things we are more
than conquerors through him who loved
us.
38For I am convinced that neither death
nor life, neither angels nor demons,
neither the present nor the future, nor
any powers,
39neither height nor depth, nor anything
else in all creation, will be able to
separate us from the love of God that is
in Christ Jesus our Lord.
9I speak the truth in Christ--I am not
lying, my conscience confirms it in the
Holy Spirit--
2I have great sorrow and unceasing
anguish in my heart.
3For I could wish that I myself were
cursed and cut off from Christ for the
sake of my brothers, those of my own
race,
4the people of Israel. Theirs is the
adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory,
the covenants, the receiving of the law,
the temple worship and the promises.
5Theirs are the patriarchs, and from
them is traced the human ancestry of
Christ, who is God over all, forever
praised! Amen.
6It is not as though God's word had
failed. For not all who are descended
from Israel are Israel.
7Nor because they are his descendants
are they all Abraham's children. On the
contrary, "It is through Isaac that your
offspring will be reckoned."
8In other words, it is not the natural
children who are God's children, but it is
the children of the promise who are
regarded as Abraham's offspring.
9For this was how the promise was
stated: "At the appointed time I will
return, and Sarah will have a son."
10Not only that, but Rebekah's children
had one and the same father, our father
Isaac.
11Yet, before the twins were born or had
done anything good or bad--in order that
God's purpose in election might stand:
12not by works but by him who calls--she
was told, "The older will serve the
younger."
13Just as it is written: "Jacob I loved, but
Esau I hated."
14What then shall we say? Is God
unjust? Not at all!
15For he says to Moses, "I will have
mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will
have compassion on whom I have
compassion."
16It does not, therefore, depend on
man's desire or effort, but on God's
mercy.
17For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: "I
raised you up for this very purpose, that
I might display my power in you and that
my name might be proclaimed in all the
earth."
18Therefore God has mercy on whom he
wants to have mercy, and he hardens
whom he wants to harden.
19One of you will say to me: "Then why
does God still blame us? For who
resists his will?"
20But who are you, O man, to talk back
to God? "Shall what is formed say to
him who formed it, 'Why did you make
me like this?' "
21Does not the potter have the right to
make out of the same lump of clay some
pottery for noble purposes and some for
common use?
22What if God, choosing to show his
wrath and make his power known, bore
with great patience the objects of his
wrath--prepared for destruction?
23What if he did this to make the riches
of his glory known to the objects of his
mercy, whom he prepared in advance
for glory--
24even us, whom he also called, not only
from the Jews but also from the
Gentiles?
25As he says in Hosea: "I will call them
'my people' who are not my people; and
I will call her 'my loved one' who is not
my loved one,"
26and, "It will happen that in the very
place where it was said to them, 'You
are not my people,' they will be called
'sons of the living God.' "
27Isaiah cries out concerning Israel:
"Though the number of the Israelites be
like the sand by the sea, only the
remnant will be saved.
28For the Lord will carry out his sentence
on earth with speed and finality."
29It is just as Isaiah said previously:
"Unless the Lord Almighty had left us
descendants, we would have become
like Sodom, we would have been like
Gomorrah."
30What then shall we say? That the
Gentiles, who did not pursue
righteousness, have obtained it, a
righteousness that is by faith;
31but Israel, who pursued a law of
righteousness, has not attained it.
32Why not? Because they pursued it not
by faith but as if it were by works. They
stumbled over the "stumbling stone."
33As it is written: "See, I lay in Zion a
stone that causes men to stumble and a
rock that makes them fall, and the one
who trusts in him will never be put to
shame."
10Brothers, my heart's desire and
prayer to God for the Israelites is that
they may be saved.
2For I can testify about them that they
are zealous for God, but their zeal is not
based on knowledge.
3Since they did not know the
righteousness that comes from God and
sought to establish their own, they did
not submit to God's righteousness.
4Christ is the end of the law so that there
may be righteousness for everyone who
believes.
5Moses describes in this way the
righteousness that is by the law: "The
man who does these things will live by
them."
6But the righteousness that is by faith
says: "Do not say in your heart, 'Who
will ascend into heaven?' " (that is, to
bring Christ down)
7"or 'Who will descend into the deep?' "
(that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).
8But what does it say? "The word is near
you; it is in your mouth and in your
heart," that is, the word of faith we are
proclaiming:
9That if you confess with your mouth,
"Jesus is Lord," and believe in your
heart that God raised him from the dead,
you will be saved.
10For it is with your heart that you
believe and are justified, and it is with
your mouth that you confess and are
saved.
11As the Scripture says, "Anyone who
trusts in him will never be put to shame."
12For there is no difference between Jew
and Gentile--the same Lord is Lord of all
and richly blesses all who call on him,
13for, "Everyone who calls on the name
of the Lord will be saved."
14How, then, can they call on the one
they have not believed in? And how can
they believe in the one of whom they
have not heard? And how can they hear
without someone preaching to them?
15And how can they preach unless they
are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful
are the feet of those who bring good
news!"
16But not all the Israelites accepted the
good news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who
has believed our message?"
17Consequently, faith comes from
hearing the message, and the message
is heard through the word of Christ.
18But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course
they did: "Their voice has gone out into
all the earth, their words to the ends of
the world."
19Again I ask: Did Israel not understand?
First, Moses says, "I will make you
envious by those who are not a nation; I
will make you angry by a nation that has
no understanding."
20And Isaiah boldly says, "I was found
by those who did not seek me; I
revealed myself to those who did not
ask for me."
21But concerning Israel he says, "All day
long I have held out my hands to a
disobedient and obstinate people."
11I ask then: Did God reject his
people? By no means! I am an Israelite
myself, a descendant of Abraham, from
the tribe of Benjamin.
2God did not reject his people, whom he
foreknew. Don't you know what the
Scripture says in the passage about
Elijah--how he appealed to God against
Israel:
3"Lord, they have killed your prophets
and torn down your altars; I am the only
one left, and they are trying to kill me" ?
4And what was God's answer to him? "I
have reserved for myself seven
thousand who have not bowed the knee
to Baal."
5So too, at the present time there is a
remnant chosen by grace.
6And if by grace, then it is no longer by
works; if it were, grace would no longer
be grace.
7What then? What Israel sought so
earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect
did. The others were hardened,
8as it is written: "God gave them a spirit
of stupor, eyes so that they could not
see and ears so that they could not hear,
to this very day."
9And David says: "May their table
become a snare and a trap, a stumbling
block and a retribution for them.
10May their eyes be darkened so they
cannot see, and their backs be bent
forever."
11Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to
fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather,
because of their transgression, salvation
has come to the Gentiles to make Israel
envious.
12But if their transgression means riches
for the world, and their loss means
riches for the Gentiles, how much
greater riches will their fullness bring!
13I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch
as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I
make much of my ministry
14in the hope that I may somehow
arouse my own people to envy and save
some of them.
15For if their rejection is the
reconciliation of the world, what will their
acceptance be but life from the dead?
16If the part of the dough offered as
firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is
holy; if the root is holy, so are the
branches.
17If some of the branches have been
broken off, and you, though a wild olive
shoot, have been grafted in among the
others and now share in the nourishing
sap from the olive root,
18do not boast over those branches. If
you do, consider this: You do not
support the root, but the root supports
you.
19You will say then, "Branches were
broken off so that I could be grafted in."
20Granted. But they were broken off
because of unbelief, and you stand by
faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.
21For if God did not spare the natural
branches, he will not spare you either.
22Consider therefore the kindness and
sternness of God: sternness to those
who fell, but kindness to you, provided
that you continue in his kindness.
Otherwise, you also will be cut off.
23And if they do not persist in unbelief,
they will be grafted in, for God is able to
graft them in again.
24After all, if you were cut out of an olive
tree that is wild by nature, and contrary
to nature were grafted into a cultivated
olive tree, how much more readily will
these, the natural branches, be grafted
into their own olive tree!
25I do not want you to be ignorant of this
mystery, brothers, so that you may not
be conceited: Israel has experienced a
hardening in part until the full number of
the Gentiles has come in.
26And so all Israel will be saved, as it is
written: "The deliverer will come from
Zion; he will turn godlessness away
from Jacob.
27And this is my covenant with them
when I take away their sins."
28As far as the gospel is concerned, they
are enemies on your account; but as far
as election is concerned, they are loved
on account of the patriarchs,
29for God's gifts and his call are
irrevocable.
30Just as you who were at one time
disobedient to God have now received
mercy as a result of their disobedience,
31so they too have now become
disobedient in order that they too may
now receive mercy as a result of God's
mercy to you.
32For God has bound all men over to
disobedience so that he may have
mercy on them all.
33Oh, the depth of the riches of the
wisdom and knowledge of God! How
unsearchable his judgments, and his
paths beyond tracing out!
34"Who has known the mind of the Lord?
Or who has been his counselor?"
35"Who has ever given to God, that God
should repay him?"
36For from him and through him and to
him are all things. To him be the glory
forever! Amen.
12Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in
view of God's mercy, to offer your
bodies as living sacrifices, holy and
pleasing to God--this is your spiritual act
of worship.
2Do not conform any longer to the
pattern of this world, but be transformed
by the renewing of your mind. Then you
will be able to test and approve what
God's will is--his good, pleasing and
perfect will.
3For by the grace given me I say to
every one of you: Do not think of
yourself more highly than you ought, but
rather think of yourself with sober
judgment, in accordance with the
measure of faith God has given you.
4Just as each of us has one body with
many members, and these members do
not all have the same function,
5so in Christ we who are many form one
body, and each member belongs to all
the others.
6We have different gifts, according to the
grace given us. If a man's gift is
prophesying, let him use it in proportion
to his faith.
7If it is serving, let him serve; if it is
teaching, let him teach;
8if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if
it is contributing to the needs of others,
let him give generously; if it is leadership,
let him govern diligently; if it is showing
mercy, let him do it cheerfully.
9Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil;
cling to what is good.
10Be devoted to one another in brotherly
love. Honor one another above
yourselves.
11Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your
spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.
12Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction,
faithful in prayer.
13Share with God's people who are in
need. Practice hospitality.
14Bless those who persecute you; bless
and do not curse.
15Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn
with those who mourn.
16Live in harmony with one another. Do
not be proud, but be willing to associate
with people of low position. Do not be
conceited.
17Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be
careful to do what is right in the eyes of
everybody.
18If it is possible, as far as it depends on
you, live at peace with everyone.
19Do not take revenge, my friends, but
leave room for God's wrath, for it is
written: "It is mine to avenge; I will
repay," says the Lord.
20On the contrary: "If your enemy is
hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give
him something to drink. In doing this,
you will heap burning coals on his
head."
21Do not be overcome by evil, but
overcome evil with good.
13Everyone must submit himself to
the governing authorities, for there is no
authority except that which God has
established. The authorities that exist
have been established by God.
2Consequently, he who rebels against
the authority is rebelling against what
God has instituted, and those who do so
will bring judgment on themselves.
3For rulers hold no terror for those who
do right, but for those who do wrong. Do
you want to be free from fear of the one
in authority? Then do what is right and
he will commend you.
4For he is God's servant to do you good.
But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he
does not bear the sword for nothing. He
is God's servant, an agent of wrath to
bring punishment on the wrongdoer.
5Therefore, it is necessary to submit to
the authorities, not only because of
possible punishment but also because
of conscience.
6This is also why you pay taxes, for the
authorities are God's servants, who give
their full time to governing.
7Give everyone what you owe him: If
you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue,
then revenue; if respect, then respect; if
honor, then honor.
8Let no debt remain outstanding, except
the continuing debt to love one another,
for he who loves his fellowman has
fulfilled the law.
9The commandments, "Do not commit
adultery," "Do not murder," "Do not
steal," "Do not covet," and whatever
other commandment there may be, are
summed up in this one rule: "Love your
neighbor as yourself."
10Love does no harm to its neighbor.
Therefore love is the fulfillment of the
law.
11And do this, understanding the present
time. The hour has come for you to
wake up from your slumber, because
our salvation is nearer now than when
we first believed.
12The night is nearly over; the day is
almost here. So let us put aside the
deeds of darkness and put on the armor
of light.
13Let us behave decently, as in the
daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness,
not in sexual immorality and debauchery,
not in dissension and jealousy.
14Rather, clothe yourselves with the
Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think
about how to gratify the desires of the
sinful nature.
14Accept him whose faith is weak,
without passing judgment on disputable
matters.
2One man's faith allows him to eat
everything, but another man, whose
faith is weak, eats only vegetables.
3The man who eats everything must not
look down on him who does not, and the
man who does not eat everything must
not condemn the man who does, for
God has accepted him.
4Who are you to judge someone else's
servant? To his own master he stands
or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is
able to make him stand.
5One man considers one day more
sacred than another; another man
considers every day alike. Each one
should be fully convinced in his own
mind.
6He who regards one day as special,
does so to the Lord. He who eats meat,
eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to
God; and he who abstains, does so to
the Lord and gives thanks to God.
7For none of us lives to himself alone
and none of us dies to himself alone.
8If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we
die, we die to the Lord. So, whether we
live or die, we belong to the Lord.
9For this very reason, Christ died and
returned to life so that he might be the
Lord of both the dead and the living.
10You, then, why do you judge your
brother? Or why do you look down on
your brother? For we will all stand
before God's judgment seat.
11It is written: " 'As surely as I live,' says
the Lord, 'every knee will bow before
me; every tongue will confess to God.' "
12So then, each of us will give an
account of himself to God.
13Therefore let us stop passing
judgment on one another. Instead, make
up your mind not to put any stumbling
block or obstacle in your brother's way.
14As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am
fully convinced that no food is unclean in
itself. But if anyone regards something
as unclean, then for him it is unclean.
15If your brother is distressed because of
what you eat, you are no longer acting
in love. Do not by your eating destroy
your brother for whom Christ died.
16Do not allow what you consider good
to be spoken of as evil.
17For the kingdom of God is not a matter
of eating and drinking, but of
righteousness, peace and joy in the
Holy Spirit,
18because anyone who serves Christ in
this way is pleasing to God and
approved by men.
19Let us therefore make every effort to
do what leads to peace and to mutual
edification.
20Do not destroy the work of God for the
sake of food. All food is clean, but it is
wrong for a man to eat anything that
causes someone else to stumble.
21It is better not to eat meat or drink
wine or to do anything else that will
cause your brother to fall.
22So whatever you believe about these
things keep between yourself and God.
Blessed is the man who does not
condemn himself by what he approves.
23But the man who has doubts is
condemned if he eats, because his
eating is not from faith; and everything
that does not come from faith is sin.
15We who are strong ought to bear
with the failings of the weak and not to
please ourselves.
2Each of us should please his neighbor
for his good, to build him up.
3For even Christ did not please himself
but, as it is written: "The insults of those
who insult you have fallen on me."
4For everything that was written in the
past was written to teach us, so that
through endurance and the
encouragement of the Scriptures we
might have hope.
5May the God who gives endurance and
encouragement give you a spirit of unity
among yourselves as you follow Christ
Jesus,
6so that with one heart and mouth you
may glorify the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ.
7Accept one another, then, just as Christ
accepted you, in order to bring praise to
God.
8For I tell you that Christ has become a
servant of the Jews on behalf of God's
truth, to confirm the promises made to
the patriarchs
9so that the Gentiles may glorify God for
his mercy, as it is written: "Therefore I
will praise you among the Gentiles; I will
sing hymns to your name."
10Again, it says, "Rejoice, O Gentiles,
with his people."
11And again, "Praise the Lord, all you
Gentiles, and sing praises to him, all you
peoples."
12And again, Isaiah says, "The Root of
Jesse will spring up, one who will arise
to rule over the nations; the Gentiles will
hope in him."
13May the God of hope fill you with all
joy and peace as you trust in him, so
that you may overflow with hope by the
power of the Holy Spirit.
14I myself am convinced, my brothers,
that you yourselves are full of goodness,
complete in knowledge and competent
to instruct one another.
15I have written you quite boldly on
some points, as if to remind you of them
again, because of the grace God gave
me
16to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the
Gentiles with the priestly duty of
proclaiming the gospel of God, so that
the Gentiles might become an offering
acceptable to God, sanctified by the
Holy Spirit.
17Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my
service to God.
18I will not venture to speak of anything
except what Christ has accomplished
through me in leading the Gentiles to
obey God by what I have said and done-
-
19by the power of signs and miracles,
through the power of the Spirit. So from
Jerusalem all the way around to
Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the
gospel of Christ.
20It has always been my ambition to
preach the gospel where Christ was not
known, so that I would not be building
on someone else's foundation.
21Rather, as it is written: "Those who
were not told about him will see, and
those who have not heard will
understand."
22This is why I have often been hindered
from coming to you.
23But now that there is no more place for
me to work in these regions, and since I
have been longing for many years to
see you,
24I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I
hope to visit you while passing through
and to have you assist me on my
journey there, after I have enjoyed your
company for a while.
25Now, however, I am on my way to
Jerusalem in the service of the saints
there.
26For Macedonia and Achaia were
pleased to make a contribution for the
poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
27They were pleased to do it, and indeed
they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles
have shared in the Jews' spiritual
blessings, they owe it to the Jews to
share with them their material blessings.
28So after I have completed this task
and have made sure that they have
received this fruit, I will go to Spain and
visit you on the way.
29I know that when I come to you, I will
come in the full measure of the blessing
of Christ.
30I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus
Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to
join me in my struggle by praying to God
for me.
31Pray that I may be rescued from the
unbelievers in Judea and that my
service in Jerusalem may be acceptable
to the saints there,
32so that by God's will I may come to
you with joy and together with you be
refreshed.
33The God of peace be with you all.
Amen.
16I commend to you our sister
Phoebe, a servant of the church in
Cenchrea.
2I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a
way worthy of the saints and to give her
any help she may need from you, for
she has been a great help to many
people, including me.
3Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow
workers in Christ Jesus.
4They risked their lives for me. Not only I
but all the churches of the Gentiles are
grateful to them.
5Greet also the church that meets at
their house. Greet my dear friend
Epenetus, who was the first convert to
Christ in the province of Asia.
6Greet Mary, who worked very hard for
you.
7Greet Andronicus and Junias, my
relatives who have been in prison with
me. They are outstanding among the
apostles, and they were in Christ before
I was.
8Greet Ampliatus, whom I love in the
Lord.
9Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in
Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.
10Greet Apelles, tested and approved in
Christ. Greet those who belong to the
household of Aristobulus.
11Greet Herodion, my relative. Greet
those in the household of Narcissus who
are in the Lord.
12Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those
women who work hard in the Lord.
Greet my dear friend Persis, another
woman who has worked very hard in the
Lord.
13Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and
his mother, who has been a mother to
me, too.
14Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes,
Patrobas, Hermas and the brothers with
them.
15Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and
his sister, and Olympas and all the
saints with them.
16Greet one another with a holy kiss. All
the churches of Christ send greetings.
17I urge you, brothers, to watch out for
those who cause divisions and put
obstacles in your way that are contrary
to the teaching you have learned. Keep
away from them.
18For such people are not serving our
Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By
smooth talk and flattery they deceive the
minds of naive people.
19Everyone has heard about your
obedience, so I am full of joy over you;
but I want you to be wise about what is
good, and innocent about what is evil.
20The God of peace will soon crush
Satan under your feet. The grace of our
Lord Jesus be with you.
21Timothy, my fellow worker, sends his
greetings to you, as do Lucius, Jason
and Sosipater, my relatives.
22I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter,
greet you in the Lord.
23Gaius, whose hospitality I and the
whole church here enjoy, sends you his
greetings. Erastus, who is the city's
director of public works, and our brother
Quartus send you their greetings.
25Now to him who is able to establish
you by my gospel and the proclamation
of Jesus Christ, according to the
revelation of the mystery hidden for long
ages past,
26but now revealed and made known
through the prophetic writings by the
command of the eternal God, so that all
nations might believe and obey him--
27to the only wise God be glory forever
through Jesus Christ! Amen.
1st Corinthians
1Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ
Jesus by the will of God, and our brother
Sosthenes,
2To the church of God in Corinth, to
those sanctified in Christ Jesus and
called to be holy, together with all those
everywhere who call on the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ--their Lord and ours:
3Grace and peace to you from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
4I always thank God for you because of
his grace given you in Christ Jesus.
5For in him you have been enriched in
every way--in all your speaking and in
all your knowledge--
6because our testimony about Christ
was confirmed in you.
7Therefore you do not lack any spiritual
gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord
Jesus Christ to be revealed.
8He will keep you strong to the end, so
that you will be blameless on the day of
our Lord Jesus Christ.
9God, who has called you into fellowship
with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is
faithful.
10I appeal to you, brothers, in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you
agree with one another so that there
may be no divisions among you and that
you may be perfectly united in mind and
thought.
11My brothers, some from Chloe's
household have informed me that there
are quarrels among you.
12What I mean is this: One of you says,
"I follow Paul"; another, "I follow
Apollos"; another, "I follow Cephas "; still
another, "I follow Christ."
13Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified
for you? Were you baptized into the
name of Paul?
14I am thankful that I did not baptize any
of you except Crispus and Gaius,
15so no one can say that you were
baptized into my name.
16(Yes, I also baptized the household of
Stephanas; beyond that, I don't
remember if I baptized anyone else.)
17For Christ did not send me to baptize,
but to preach the gospel--not with words
of human wisdom, lest the cross of
Christ be emptied of its power.
18For the message of the cross is
foolishness to those who are perishing,
but to us who are being saved it is the
power of God.
19For it is written: "I will destroy the
wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of
the intelligent I will frustrate."
20Where is the wise man? Where is the
scholar? Where is the philosopher of
this age? Has not God made foolish the
wisdom of the world?
21For since in the wisdom of God the
world through its wisdom did not know
him, God was pleased through the
foolishness of what was preached to
save those who believe.
22Jews demand miraculous signs and
Greeks look for wisdom,
23but we preach Christ crucified: a
stumbling block to Jews and foolishness
to Gentiles,
24but to those whom God has called,
both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power
of God and the wisdom of God.
25For the foolishness of God is wiser
than man's wisdom, and the weakness
of God is stronger than man's strength.
26Brothers, think of what you were when
you were called. Not many of you were
wise by human standards; not many
were influential; not many were of noble
birth.
27But God chose the foolish things of the
world to shame the wise; God chose the
weak things of the world to shame the
strong.
28He chose the lowly things of this world
and the despised things--and the things
that are not--to nullify the things that are,
29so that no one may boast before him.
30It is because of him that you are in
Christ Jesus, who has become for us
wisdom from God--that is, our
righteousness, holiness and redemption.
31Therefore, as it is written: "Let him who
boasts boast in the Lord."
2When I came to you, brothers, I did
not come with eloquence or superior
wisdom as I proclaimed to you the
testimony about God.
2For I resolved to know nothing while I
was with you except Jesus Christ and
him crucified.
3I came to you in weakness and fear,
and with much trembling.
4My message and my preaching were
not with wise and persuasive words, but
with a demonstration of the Spirit's
power,
5so that your faith might not rest on
men's wisdom, but on God's power.
6We do, however, speak a message of
wisdom among the mature, but not the
wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this
age, who are coming to nothing.
7No, we speak of God's secret wisdom,
a wisdom that has been hidden and that
God destined for our glory before time
began.
8None of the rulers of this age
understood it, for if they had, they would
not have crucified the Lord of glory.
9However, as it is written: "No eye has
seen, no ear has heard, no mind has
conceived what God has prepared for
those who love him" --
10but God has revealed it to us by his
Spirit.
11The Spirit searches all things, even the
deep things of God. For who among
men knows the thoughts of a man
except the man's spirit within him? In the
same way no one knows the thoughts of
God except the Spirit of God.
12We have not received the spirit of the
world but the Spirit who is from God,
that we may understand what God has
freely given us.
13This is what we speak, not in words
taught us by human wisdom but in
words taught by the Spirit, expressing
spiritual truths in spiritual words.
14The man without the Spirit does not
accept the things that come from the
Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to
him, and he cannot understand them,
because they are spiritually discerned.
15The spiritual man makes judgments
about all things, but he himself is not
subject to any man's judgment:
16"For who has known the mind of the
Lord that he may instruct him?" But we
have the mind of Christ.
3Brothers, I could not address you as
spiritual but as worldly--mere infants in
Christ.
2I gave you milk, not solid food, for you
were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are
still not ready.
3You are still worldly. For since there is
jealousy and quarreling among you, are
you not worldly? Are you not acting like
mere men?
4For when one says, "I follow Paul," and
another, "I follow Apollos," are you not
mere men?
5What, after all, is Apollos? And what is
Paul? Only servants, through whom you
came to believe--as the Lord has
assigned to each his task.
6I planted the seed, Apollos watered it,
but God made it grow.
7So neither he who plants nor he who
waters is anything, but only God, who
makes things grow.
8The man who plants and the man who
waters have one purpose, and each will
be rewarded according to his own labor.
9For we are God's fellow workers; you
are God's field, God's building.
10By the grace God has given me, I laid
a foundation as an expert builder, and
someone else is building on it. But each
one should be careful how he builds.
11For no one can lay any foundation
other than the one already laid, which is
Jesus Christ.
12If any man builds on this foundation
using gold, silver, costly stones, wood,
hay or straw,
13his work will be shown for what it is,
because the Day will bring it to light. It
will be revealed with fire, and the fire will
test the quality of each man's work.
14If what he has built survives, he will
receive his reward.
15If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he
himself will be saved, but only as one
escaping through the flames.
16Don't you know that you yourselves
are God's temple and that God's Spirit
lives in you?
17If anyone destroys God's temple, God
will destroy him; for God's temple is
sacred, and you are that temple.
18Do not deceive yourselves. If any one
of you thinks he is wise by the standards
of this age, he should become a "fool"
so that he may become wise.
19For the wisdom of this world is
foolishness in God's sight. As it is
written: "He catches the wise in their
craftiness" ;
20and again, "The Lord knows that the
thoughts of the wise are futile."
21So then, no more boasting about men!
All things are yours,
22whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or
the world or life or death or the present
or the future--all are yours,
23and you are of Christ, and Christ is of
God.
4So then, men ought to regard us as
servants of Christ and as those
entrusted with the secret things of God.
2Now it is required that those who have
been given a trust must prove faithful.
3I care very little if I am judged by you or
by any human court; indeed, I do not
even judge myself.
4My conscience is clear, but that does
not make me innocent. It is the Lord
who judges me.
5Therefore judge nothing before the
appointed time; wait till the Lord comes.
He will bring to light what is hidden in
darkness and will expose the motives of
men's hearts. At that time each will
receive his praise from God.
6Now, brothers, I have applied these
things to myself and Apollos for your
benefit, so that you may learn from us
the meaning of the saying, "Do not go
beyond what is written." Then you will
not take pride in one man over against
another.
7For who makes you different from
anyone else? What do you have that
you did not receive? And if you did
receive it, why do you boast as though
you did not?
8Already you have all you want! Already
you have become rich! You have
become kings--and that without us! How
I wish that you really had become kings
so that we might be kings with you!
9For it seems to me that God has put us
apostles on display at the end of the
procession, like men condemned to die
in the arena. We have been made a
spectacle to the whole universe, to
angels as well as to men.
10We are fools for Christ, but you are so
wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are
strong! You are honored, we are
dishonored!
11To this very hour we go hungry and
thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally
treated, we are homeless.
12We work hard with our own hands.
When we are cursed, we bless; when
we are persecuted, we endure it;
13when we are slandered, we answer
kindly. Up to this moment we have
become the scum of the earth, the
refuse of the world.
14I am not writing this to shame you, but
to warn you, as my dear children.
15Even though you have ten thousand
guardians in Christ, you do not have
many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I
became your father through the gospel.
16Therefore I urge you to imitate me.
17For this reason I am sending to you
Timothy, my son whom I love, who is
faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of
my way of life in Christ Jesus, which
agrees with what I teach everywhere in
every church.
18Some of you have become arrogant,
as if I were not coming to you.
19But I will come to you very soon, if the
Lord is willing, and then I will find out not
only how these arrogant people are
talking, but what power they have.
20For the kingdom of God is not a matter
of talk but of power.
21What do you prefer? Shall I come to
you with a whip, or in love and with a
gentle spirit?
5It is actually reported that there is
sexual immorality among you, and of a
kind that does not occur even among
pagans: A man has his father's wife.
2And you are proud! Shouldn't you
rather have been filled with grief and
have put out of your fellowship the man
who did this?
3Even though I am not physically
present, I am with you in spirit. And I
have already passed judgment on the
one who did this, just as if I were
present.
4When you are assembled in the name
of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in
spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus
is present,
5hand this man over to Satan, so that
the sinful nature may be destroyed and
his spirit saved on the day of the Lord.
6Your boasting is not good. Don't you
know that a little yeast works through
the whole batch of dough?
7Get rid of the old yeast that you may be
a new batch without yeast--as you really
are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has
been sacrificed.
8Therefore let us keep the Festival, not
with the old yeast, the yeast of malice
and wickedness, but with bread without
yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth.
9I have written you in my letter not to
associate with sexually immoral people--
10not at all meaning the people of this
world who are immoral, or the greedy
and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case
you would have to leave this world.
11But now I am writing you that you must
not associate with anyone who calls
himself a brother but is sexually immoral
or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a
drunkard or a swindler. With such a man
do not even eat.
12What business is it of mine to judge
those outside the church? Are you not to
judge those inside?
13God will judge those outside. "Expel
the wicked man from among you."
6If any of you has a dispute with
another, dare he take it before the
ungodly for judgment instead of before
the saints?
2Do you not know that the saints will
judge the world? And if you are to judge
the world, are you not competent to
judge trivial cases?
3Do you not know that we will judge
angels? How much more the things of
this life!
4Therefore, if you have disputes about
such matters, appoint as judges even
men of little account in the church!
5I say this to shame you. Is it possible
that there is nobody among you wise
enough to judge a dispute between
believers?
6But instead, one brother goes to law
against another--and this in front of
unbelievers!
7The very fact that you have lawsuits
among you means you have been
completely defeated already. Why not
rather be wronged? Why not rather be
cheated?
8Instead, you yourselves cheat and do
wrong, and you do this to your brothers.
9Do you not know that the wicked will
not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not
be deceived: Neither the sexually
immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor
male prostitutes nor homosexual
offenders
10nor thieves nor the greedy nor
drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers
will inherit the kingdom of God.
11And that is what some of you were.
But you were washed, you were
sanctified, you were justified in the
name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by
the Spirit of our God.
12"Everything is permissible for me"--but
not everything is beneficial. "Everything
is permissible for me"--but I will not be
mastered by anything.
13"Food for the stomach and the
stomach for food"--but God will destroy
them both. The body is not meant for
sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and
the Lord for the body.
14By his power God raised the Lord from
the dead, and he will raise us also.
15Do you not know that your bodies are
members of Christ himself? Shall I then
take the members of Christ and unite
them with a prostitute? Never!
16Do you not know that he who unites
himself with a prostitute is one with her
in body? For it is said, "The two will
become one flesh."
17But he who unites himself with the
Lord is one with him in spirit.
18Flee from sexual immorality. All other
sins a man commits are outside his
body, but he who sins sexually sins
against his own body.
19Do you not know that your body is a
temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you,
whom you have received from God?
You are not your own;
20you were bought at a price. Therefore
honor God with your body.
7Now for the matters you wrote about:
It is good for a man not to marry.
2But since there is so much immorality,
each man should have his own wife,
and each woman her own husband.
3The husband should fulfill his marital
duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to
her husband.
4The wife's body does not belong to her
alone but also to her husband. In the
same way, the husband's body does not
belong to him alone but also to his wife.
5Do not deprive each other except by
mutual consent and for a time, so that
you may devote yourselves to prayer.
Then come together again so that Satan
will not tempt you because of your lack
of self-control.
6I say this as a concession, not as a
command.
7I wish that all men were as I am. But
each man has his own gift from God;
one has this gift, another has that.
8Now to the unmarried and the widows I
say: It is good for them to stay
unmarried, as I am.
9But if they cannot control themselves,
they should marry, for it is better to
marry than to burn with passion.
10To the married I give this command
(not I, but the Lord): A wife must not
separate from her husband.
11But if she does, she must remain
unmarried or else be reconciled to her
husband. And a husband must not
divorce his wife.
12To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If
any brother has a wife who is not a
believer and she is willing to live with
him, he must not divorce her.
13And if a woman has a husband who is
not a believer and he is willing to live
with her, she must not divorce him.
14For the unbelieving husband has been
sanctified through his wife, and the
unbelieving wife has been sanctified
through her believing husband.
Otherwise your children would be
unclean, but as it is, they are holy.
15But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do
so. A believing man or woman is not
bound in such circumstances; God has
called us to live in peace.
16How do you know, wife, whether you
will save your husband? Or, how do you
know, husband, whether you will save
your wife?
17Nevertheless, each one should retain
the place in life that the Lord assigned to
him and to which God has called him.
This is the rule I lay down in all the
churches.
18Was a man already circumcised when
he was called? He should not become
uncircumcised. Was a man
uncircumcised when he was called? He
should not be circumcised.
19Circumcision is nothing and
uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping
God's commands is what counts.
20Each one should remain in the
situation which he was in when God
called him.
21Were you a slave when you were
called? Don't let it trouble you--although
if you can gain your freedom, do so.
22For he who was a slave when he was
called by the Lord is the Lord's
freedman; similarly, he who was a free
man when he was called is Christ's
slave.
23You were bought at a price; do not
become slaves of men.
24Brothers, each man, as responsible to
God, should remain in the situation God
called him to.
25Now about virgins: I have no
command from the Lord, but I give a
judgment as one who by the Lord's
mercy is trustworthy.
26Because of the present crisis, I think
that it is good for you to remain as you
are.
27Are you married? Do not seek a
divorce. Are you unmarried? Do not look
for a wife.
28But if you do marry, you have not
sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has
not sinned. But those who marry will
face many troubles in this life, and I
want to spare you this.
29What I mean, brothers, is that the time
is short. From now on those who have
wives should live as if they had none;
30those who mourn, as if they did not;
those who are happy, as if they were
not; those who buy something, as if it
were not theirs to keep;
31those who use the things of the world,
as if not engrossed in them. For this
world in its present form is passing away.
32I would like you to be free from
concern. An unmarried man is
concerned about the Lord's affairs--how
he can please the Lord.
33But a married man is concerned about
the affairs of this world--how he can
please his wife--
34and his interests are divided. An
unmarried woman or virgin is concerned
about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be
devoted to the Lord in both body and
spirit. But a married woman is
concerned about the affairs of this
world--how she can please her husband.
35I am saying this for your own good, not
to restrict you, but that you may live in a
right way in undivided devotion to the
Lord.
36If anyone thinks he is acting
improperly toward the virgin he is
engaged to, and if she is getting along in
years and he feels he ought to marry, he
should do as he wants. He is not sinning.
They should get married.
37But the man who has settled the
matter in his own mind, who is under no
compulsion but has control over his own
will, and who has made up his mind not
to marry the virgin--this man also does
the right thing.
38So then, he who marries the virgin
does right, but he who does not marry
her does even better.
39A woman is bound to her husband as
long as he lives. But if her husband dies,
she is free to marry anyone she wishes,
but he must belong to the Lord.
40In my judgment, she is happier if she
stays as she is--and I think that I too
have the Spirit of God.
8Now about food sacrificed to idols:
We know that we all possess knowledge.
Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
2The man who thinks he knows
something does not yet know as he
ought to know.
3But the man who loves God is known
by God.
4So then, about eating food sacrificed to
idols: We know that an idol is nothing at
all in the world and that there is no God
but one.
5For even if there are so-called gods,
whether in heaven or on earth (as
indeed there are many "gods" and many
"lords"),
6yet for us there is but one God, the
Father, from whom all things came and
for whom we live; and there is but one
Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all
things came and through whom we live.
7But not everyone knows this. Some
people are still so accustomed to idols
that when they eat such food they think
of it as having been sacrificed to an idol,
and since their conscience is weak, it is
defiled.
8But food does not bring us near to God;
we are no worse if we do not eat, and
no better if we do.
9Be careful, however, that the exercise
of your freedom does not become a
stumbling block to the weak.
10For if anyone with a weak conscience
sees you who have this knowledge
eating in an idol's temple, won't he be
emboldened to eat what has been
sacrificed to idols?
11So this weak brother, for whom Christ
died, is destroyed by your knowledge.
12When you sin against your brothers in
this way and wound their weak
conscience, you sin against Christ.
13Therefore, if what I eat causes my
brother to fall into sin, I will never eat
meat again, so that I will not cause him
to fall.
9Am I not free? Am I not an apostle?
Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are
you not the result of my work in the
Lord?
2Even though I may not be an apostle to
others, surely I am to you! For you are
the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
3This is my defense to those who sit in
judgment on me.
4Don't we have the right to food and
drink?
5Don't we have the right to take a
believing wife along with us, as do the
other apostles and the Lord's brothers
and Cephas ?
6Or is it only I and Barnabas who must
work for a living?
7Who serves as a soldier at his own
expense? Who plants a vineyard and
does not eat of its grapes? Who tends a
flock and does not drink of the milk?
8Do I say this merely from a human
point of view? Doesn't the Law say the
same thing?
9For it is written in the Law of Moses:
"Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading
out the grain." Is it about oxen that God
is concerned?
10Surely he says this for us, doesn't he?
Yes, this was written for us, because
when the plowman plows and the
thresher threshes, they ought to do so in
the hope of sharing in the harvest.
11If we have sown spiritual seed among
you, is it too much if we reap a material
harvest from you?
12If others have this right of support from
you, shouldn't we have it all the more?
13But we did not use this right. On the
contrary, we put up with anything rather
than hinder the gospel of Christ. Don't
you know that those who work in the
temple get their food from the temple,
and those who serve at the altar share
in what is offered on the altar?
14In the same way, the Lord has
commanded that those who preach the
gospel should receive their living from
the gospel.
15But I have not used any of these rights.
And I am not writing this in the hope that
you will do such things for me. I would
rather die than have anyone deprive me
of this boast.
16Yet when I preach the gospel, I cannot
boast, for I am compelled to preach.
Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
17If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward;
if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging
the trust committed to me.
18What then is my reward? Just this: that
in preaching the gospel I may offer it
free of charge, and so not make use of
my rights in preaching it.
19Though I am free and belong to no
man, I make myself a slave to everyone,
to win as many as possible.
20To the Jews I became like a Jew, to
win the Jews. To those under the law I
became like one under the law (though I
myself am not under the law), so as to
win those under the law.
21To those not having the law I became
like one not having the law (though I am
not free from God's law but am under
Christ's law), so as to win those not
having the law.
22To the weak I became weak, to win
the weak. I have become all things to all
men so that by all possible means I
might save some.
23I do all this for the sake of the gospel,
that I may share in its blessings.
24Do you not know that in a race all the
runners run, but only one gets the prize?
Run in such a way as to get the prize.
25Everyone who competes in the games
goes into strict training. They do it to get
a crown that will not last; but we do it to
get a crown that will last forever.
26Therefore I do not run like a man
running aimlessly; I do not fight like a
man beating the air.
27No, I beat my body and make it my
slave so that after I have preached to
others, I myself will not be disqualified
for the prize.
10For I do not want you to be
ignorant of the fact, brothers, that our
forefathers were all under the cloud and
that they all passed through the sea.
2They were all baptized into Moses in
the cloud and in the sea.
3They all ate the same spiritual food
4and drank the same spiritual drink; for
they drank from the spiritual rock that
accompanied them, and that rock was
Christ.
5Nevertheless, God was not pleased
with most of them; their bodies were
scattered over the desert.
6Now these things occurred as
examples to keep us from setting our
hearts on evil things as they did.
7Do not be idolaters, as some of them
were; as it is written: "The people sat
down to eat and drink and got up to
indulge in pagan revelry."
8We should not commit sexual
immorality, as some of them did--and in
one day twenty-three thousand of them
died.
9We should not test the Lord, as some
of them did--and were killed by snakes.
10And do not grumble, as some of them
did--and were killed by the destroying
angel.
11These things happened to them as
examples and were written down as
warnings for us, on whom the fulfillment
of the ages has come.
12So, if you think you are standing firm,
be careful that you don't fall!
13No temptation has seized you except
what is common to man. And God is
faithful; he will not let you be tempted
beyond what you can bear. But when
you are tempted, he will also provide a
way out so that you can stand up under
it.
14Therefore, my dear friends, flee from
idolatry.
15I speak to sensible people; judge for
yourselves what I say.
16Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which
we give thanks a participation in the
blood of Christ? And is not the bread
that we break a participation in the body
of Christ?
17Because there is one loaf, we, who are
many, are one body, for we all partake
of the one loaf.
18Consider the people of Israel: Do not
those who eat the sacrifices participate
in the altar?
19Do I mean then that a sacrifice offered
to an idol is anything, or that an idol is
anything?
20No, but the sacrifices of pagans are
offered to demons, not to God, and I do
not want you to be participants with
demons.
21You cannot drink the cup of the Lord
and the cup of demons too; you cannot
have a part in both the Lord's table and
the table of demons.
22Are we trying to arouse the Lord's
jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
23"Everything is permissible"--but not
everything is beneficial. "Everything is
permissible"--but not everything is
constructive.
24Nobody should seek his own good, but
the good of others.
25Eat anything sold in the meat market
without raising questions of conscience,
26for, "The earth is the Lord's, and
everything in it."
27If some unbeliever invites you to a
meal and you want to go, eat whatever
is put before you without raising
questions of conscience.
28But if anyone says to you, "This has
been offered in sacrifice," then do not
eat it, both for the sake of the man who
told you and for conscience' sake --
29the other man's conscience, I mean,
not yours. For why should my freedom
be judged by another's conscience?
30If I take part in the meal with
thankfulness, why am I denounced
because of something I thank God for?
31So whether you eat or drink or
whatever you do, do it all for the glory of
God.
32Do not cause anyone to stumble,
whether Jews, Greeks or the church of
God--
33even as I try to please everybody in
every way. For I am not seeking my own
good but the good of many, so that they
may be saved.
11Follow my example, as I follow the
example of Christ.
2I praise you for remembering me in
everything and for holding to the
teachings, just as I passed them on to
you.
3Now I want you to realize that the head
of every man is Christ, and the head of
the woman is man, and the head of
Christ is God.
4Every man who prays or prophesies
with his head covered dishonors his
head.
5And every woman who prays or
prophesies with her head uncovered
dishonors her head--it is just as though
her head were shaved.
6If a woman does not cover her head,
she should have her hair cut off; and if it
is a disgrace for a woman to have her
hair cut or shaved off, she should cover
her head.
7A man ought not to cover his head,
since he is the image and glory of God;
but the woman is the glory of man.
8For man did not come from woman, but
woman from man;
9neither was man created for woman,
but woman for man.
10For this reason, and because of the
angels, the woman ought to have a sign
of authority on her head.
11In the Lord, however, woman is not
independent of man, nor is man
independent of woman.
12For as woman came from man, so
also man is born of woman. But
everything comes from God.
13Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a
woman to pray to God with her head
uncovered?
14Does not the very nature of things
teach you that if a man has long hair, it
is a disgrace to him,
15but that if a woman has long hair, it is
her glory? For long hair is given to her
as a covering.
16If anyone wants to be contentious
about this, we have no other practice--
nor do the churches of God.
17In the following directives I have no
praise for you, for your meetings do
more harm than good.
18In the first place, I hear that when you
come together as a church, there are
divisions among you, and to some
extent I believe it.
19No doubt there have to be differences
among you to show which of you have
God's approval.
20When you come together, it is not the
Lord's Supper you eat,
21for as you eat, each of you goes
ahead without waiting for anybody else.
One remains hungry, another gets drunk.
22Don't you have homes to eat and drink
in? Or do you despise the church of God
and humiliate those who have nothing?
What shall I say to you? Shall I praise
you for this? Certainly not!
23For I received from the Lord what I
also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus,
on the night he was betrayed, took
bread,
24and when he had given thanks, he
broke it and said, "This is my body,
which is for you; do this in remembrance
of me."
25In the same way, after supper he took
the cup, saying, "This cup is the new
covenant in my blood; do this, whenever
you drink it, in remembrance of me."
26For whenever you eat this bread and
drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's
death until he comes.
27Therefore, whoever eats the bread or
drinks the cup of the Lord in an
unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning
against the body and blood of the Lord.
28A man ought to examine himself
before he eats of the bread and drinks
of the cup.
29For anyone who eats and drinks
without recognizing the body of the Lord
eats and drinks judgment on himself.
30That is why many among you are
weak and sick, and a number of you
have fallen asleep.
31But if we judged ourselves, we would
not come under judgment.
32When we are judged by the Lord, we
are being disciplined so that we will not
be condemned with the world.
33So then, my brothers, when you come
together to eat, wait for each other.
34If anyone is hungry, he should eat at
home, so that when you meet together it
may not result in judgment. And when I
come I will give further directions.
12Now about spiritual gifts, brothers,
I do not want you to be ignorant.
2You know that when you were pagans,
somehow or other you were influenced
and led astray to mute idols.
3Therefore I tell you that no one who is
speaking by the Spirit of God says,
"Jesus be cursed," and no one can say,
"Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.
4There are different kinds of gifts, but
the same Spirit.
5There are different kinds of service, but
the same Lord.
6There are different kinds of working, but
the same God works all of them in all
men.
7Now to each one the manifestation of
the Spirit is given for the common good.
8To one there is given through the Spirit
the message of wisdom, to another the
message of knowledge by means of the
same Spirit,
9to another faith by the same Spirit, to
another gifts of healing by that one Spirit,
10to another miraculous powers, to
another prophecy, to another
distinguishing between spirits, to
another speaking in different kinds of
tongues, and to still another the
interpretation of tongues.
11All these are the work of one and the
same Spirit, and he gives them to each
one, just as he determines.
12The body is a unit, though it is made
up of many parts; and though all its
parts are many, they form one body. So
it is with Christ.
13For we were all baptized by one Spirit
into one body--whether Jews or Greeks,
slave or free--and we were all given the
one Spirit to drink.
14Now the body is not made up of one
part but of many.
15If the foot should say, "Because I am
not a hand, I do not belong to the body,"
it would not for that reason cease to be
part of the body.
16And if the ear should say, "Because I
am not an eye, I do not belong to the
body," it would not for that reason cease
to be part of the body.
17If the whole body were an eye, where
would the sense of hearing be? If the
whole body were an ear, where would
the sense of smell be?
18But in fact God has arranged the parts
in the body, every one of them, just as
he wanted them to be.
19If they were all one part, where would
the body be?
20As it is, there are many parts, but one
body.
21The eye cannot say to the hand, "I
don't need you!" And the head cannot
say to the feet, "I don't need you!"
22On the contrary, those parts of the
body that seem to be weaker are
indispensable,
23and the parts that we think are less
honorable we treat with special honor.
And the parts that are unpresentable are
treated with special modesty,
24while our presentable parts need no
special treatment. But God has
combined the members of the body and
has given greater honor to the parts that
lacked it,
25so that there should be no division in
the body, but that its parts should have
equal concern for each other.
26If one part suffers, every part suffers
with it; if one part is honored, every part
rejoices with it.
27Now you are the body of Christ, and
each one of you is a part of it.
28And in the church God has appointed
first of all apostles, second prophets,
third teachers, then workers of miracles,
also those having gifts of healing, those
able to help others, those with gifts of
administration, and those speaking in
different kinds of tongues.
29Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are
all teachers? Do all work miracles?
30Do all have gifts of healing? Do all
speak in tongues ? Do all interpret?
31But eagerly desire the greater gifts.
And now I will show you the most
excellent way.
13If I speak in the tongues of men
and of angels, but have not love, I am
only a resounding gong or a clanging
cymbal.
2If I have the gift of prophecy and can
fathom all mysteries and all knowledge,
and if I have a faith that can move
mountains, but have not love, I am
nothing.
3If I give all I possess to the poor and
surrender my body to the flames, but
have not love, I gain nothing.
4Love is patient, love is kind. It does not
envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
5It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is
not easily angered, it keeps no record of
wrongs.
6Love does not delight in evil but
rejoices with the truth.
7It always protects, always trusts,
always hopes, always perseveres.
8Love never fails. But where there are
prophecies, they will cease; where there
are tongues, they will be stilled; where
there is knowledge, it will pass away.
9For we know in part and we prophesy
in part,
10but when perfection comes, the
imperfect disappears.
11When I was a child, I talked like a child,
I thought like a child, I reasoned like a
child. When I became a man, I put
childish ways behind me.
12Now we see but a poor reflection as in
a mirror; then we shall see face to face.
Now I know in part; then I shall know
fully, even as I am fully known.
13And now these three remain: faith,
hope and love. But the greatest of these
is love.
14Follow the way of love and
eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially
the gift of prophecy.
2For anyone who speaks in a tongue
does not speak to men but to God.
Indeed, no one understands him; he
utters mysteries with his spirit.
3But everyone who prophesies speaks
to men for their strengthening,
encouragement and comfort.
4He who speaks in a tongue edifies
himself, but he who prophesies edifies
the church.
5I would like every one of you to speak
in tongues, but I would rather have you
prophesy. He who prophesies is greater
than one who speaks in tongues, unless
he interprets, so that the church may be
edified.
6Now, brothers, if I come to you and
speak in tongues, what good will I be to
you, unless I bring you some revelation
or knowledge or prophecy or word of
instruction?
7Even in the case of lifeless things that
make sounds, such as the flute or harp,
how will anyone know what tune is
being played unless there is a distinction
in the notes?
8Again, if the trumpet does not sound a
clear call, who will get ready for battle?
9So it is with you. Unless you speak
intelligible words with your tongue, how
will anyone know what you are saying?
You will just be speaking into the air.
10Undoubtedly there are all sorts of
languages in the world, yet none of
them is without meaning.
11If then I do not grasp the meaning of
what someone is saying, I am a
foreigner to the speaker, and he is a
foreigner to me.
12So it is with you. Since you are eager
to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts
that build up the church.
13For this reason anyone who speaks in
a tongue should pray that he may
interpret what he says.
14For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit
prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
15So what shall I do? I will pray with my
spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I
will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing
with my mind.
16If you are praising God with your spirit,
how can one who finds himself among
those who do not understand say
"Amen" to your thanksgiving, since he
does not know what you are saying?
17You may be giving thanks well enough,
but the other man is not edified.
18I thank God that I speak in tongues
more than all of you.
19But in the church I would rather speak
five intelligible words to instruct others
than ten thousand words in a tongue.
20Brothers, stop thinking like children. In
regard to evil be infants, but in your
thinking be adults.
21In the Law it is written: "Through men
of strange tongues and through the lips
of foreigners I will speak to this people,
but even then they will not listen to me,"
says the Lord.
22Tongues, then, are a sign, not for
believers but for unbelievers; prophecy,
however, is for believers, not for
unbelievers.
23So if the whole church comes together
and everyone speaks in tongues, and
some who do not understand or some
unbelievers come in, will they not say
that you are out of your mind?
24But if an unbeliever or someone who
does not understand comes in while
everybody is prophesying, he will be
convinced by all that he is a sinner and
will be judged by all,
25and the secrets of his heart will be laid
bare. So he will fall down and worship
God, exclaiming, "God is really among
you!"
26What then shall we say, brothers?
When you come together, everyone has
a hymn, or a word of instruction, a
revelation, a tongue or an interpretation.
All of these must be done for the
strengthening of the church.
27If anyone speaks in a tongue, two--or
at the most three--should speak, one at
a time, and someone must interpret.
28If there is no interpreter, the speaker
should keep quiet in the church and
speak to himself and God.
29Two or three prophets should speak,
and the others should weigh carefully
what is said.
30And if a revelation comes to someone
who is sitting down, the first speaker
should stop.
31For you can all prophesy in turn so
that everyone may be instructed and
encouraged.
32The spirits of prophets are subject to
the control of prophets.
33For God is not a God of disorder but of
peace.
34As in all the congregations of the
saints, women should remain silent in
the churches. They are not allowed to
speak, but must be in submission, as
the Law says.
35If they want to inquire about something,
they should ask their own husbands at
home; for it is disgraceful for a woman
to speak in the church.
36Did the word of God originate with
you? Or are you the only people it has
reached?
37If anybody thinks he is a prophet or
spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge
that what I am writing to you is the
Lord's command.
38If he ignores this, he himself will be
ignored.
39Therefore, my brothers, be eager to
prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in
tongues.
40But everything should be done in a
fitting and orderly way.
15Now, brothers, I want to remind
you of the gospel I preached to you,
which you received and on which you
have taken your stand.
2By this gospel you are saved, if you
hold firmly to the word I preached to you.
Otherwise, you have believed in vain.
3For what I received I passed on to you
as of first importance : that Christ died
for our sins according to the Scriptures,
4that he was buried, that he was raised
on the third day according to the
Scriptures,
5and that he appeared to Peter, and
then to the Twelve.
6After that, he appeared to more than
five hundred of the brothers at the same
time, most of whom are still living,
though some have fallen asleep.
7Then he appeared to James, then to all
the apostles,
8and last of all he appeared to me also,
as to one abnormally born.
9For I am the least of the apostles and
do not even deserve to be called an
apostle, because I persecuted the
church of God.
10But by the grace of God I am what I
am, and his grace to me was not without
effect. No, I worked harder than all of
them--yet not I, but the grace of God
that was with me.
11Whether, then, it was I or they, this is
what we preach, and this is what you
believed.
12But if it is preached that Christ has
been raised from the dead, how can
some of you say that there is no
resurrection of the dead?
13If there is no resurrection of the dead,
then not even Christ has been raised.
14And if Christ has not been raised, our
preaching is useless and so is your faith.
15More than that, we are then found to
be false witnesses about God, for we
have testified about God that he raised
Christ from the dead. But he did not
raise him if in fact the dead are not
raised.
16For if the dead are not raised, then
Christ has not been raised either.
17And if Christ has not been raised, your
faith is futile; you are still in your sins.
18Then those also who have fallen
asleep in Christ are lost.
19If only for this life we have hope in
Christ, we are to be pitied more than all
men.
20But Christ has indeed been raised
from the dead, the firstfruits of those
who have fallen asleep.
21For since death came through a man,
the resurrection of the dead comes also
through a man.
22For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all
will be made alive.
23But each in his own turn: Christ, the
firstfruits; then, when he comes, those
who belong to him.
24Then the end will come, when he
hands over the kingdom to God the
Father after he has destroyed all
dominion, authority and power.
25For he must reign until he has put all
his enemies under his feet.
26The last enemy to be destroyed is
death.
27For he "has put everything under his
feet." Now when it says that "everything"
has been put under him, it is clear that
this does not include God himself, who
put everything under Christ.
28When he has done this, then the Son
himself will be made subject to him who
put everything under him, so that God
may be all in all.
29Now if there is no resurrection, what
will those do who are baptized for the
dead? If the dead are not raised at all,
why are people baptized for them?
30And as for us, why do we endanger
ourselves every hour?
31I die every day--I mean that, brothers--
just as surely as I glory over you in
Christ Jesus our Lord.
32If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for
merely human reasons, what have I
gained? If the dead are not raised, "Let
us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
33Do not be misled: "Bad company
corrupts good character."
34Come back to your senses as you
ought, and stop sinning; for there are
some who are ignorant of God--I say
this to your shame.
35But someone may ask, "How are the
dead raised? With what kind of body will
they come?"
36How foolish! What you sow does not
come to life unless it dies.
37When you sow, you do not plant the
body that will be, but just a seed,
perhaps of wheat or of something else.
38But God gives it a body as he has
determined, and to each kind of seed he
gives its own body.
39All flesh is not the same: Men have
one kind of flesh, animals have another,
birds another and fish another.
40There are also heavenly bodies and
there are earthly bodies; but the
splendor of the heavenly bodies is one
kind, and the splendor of the earthly
bodies is another.
41The sun has one kind of splendor, the
moon another and the stars another;
and star differs from star in splendor.
42So will it be with the resurrection of the
dead. The body that is sown is
perishable, it is raised imperishable;
43it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in
glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised
in power;
44it is sown a natural body, it is raised a
spiritual body. If there is a natural body,
there is also a spiritual body.
45So it is written: "The first man Adam
became a living being" ; the last Adam,
a lifegiving spirit.
46The spiritual did not come first, but the
natural, and after that the spiritual.
47The first man was of the dust of the
earth, the second man from heaven.
48As was the earthly man, so are those
who are of the earth; and as is the man
from heaven, so also are those who are
of heaven.
49And just as we have borne the
likeness of the earthly man, so shall we
bear the likeness of the man from
heaven.
50I declare to you, brothers, that flesh
and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
God, nor does the perishable inherit the
imperishable.
51Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not
all sleep, but we will all be changed--
52in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at
the last trumpet. For the trumpet will
sound, the dead will be raised
imperishable, and we will be changed.
53For the perishable must clothe itself
with the imperishable, and the mortal
with immortality.
54When the perishable has been clothed
with the imperishable, and the mortal
with immortality, then the saying that is
written will come true: "Death has been
swallowed up in victory."
55"Where, O death, is your victory?
Where, O death, is your sting?"
56The sting of death is sin, and the
power of sin is the law.
57But thanks be to God! He gives us the
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
58Therefore, my dear brothers, stand
firm. Let nothing move you. Always give
yourselves fully to the work of the Lord,
because you know that your labor in the
Lord is not in vain.
16Now about the collection for God's
people: Do what I told the Galatian
churches to do.
2On the first day of every week, each
one of you should set aside a sum of
money in keeping with his income,
saving it up, so that when I come no
collections will have to be made.
3Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of
introduction to the men you approve and
send them with your gift to Jerusalem.
4If it seems advisable for me to go also,
they will accompany me.
5After I go through Macedonia, I will
come to you--for I will be going through
Macedonia.
6Perhaps I will stay with you awhile, or
even spend the winter, so that you can
help me on my journey, wherever I go.
7I do not want to see you now and make
only a passing visit; I hope to spend
some time with you, if the Lord permits.
8But I will stay on at Ephesus until
Pentecost,
9because a great door for effective work
has opened to me, and there are many
who oppose me.
10If Timothy comes, see to it that he has
nothing to fear while he is with you, for
he is carrying on the work of the Lord,
just as I am.
11No one, then, should refuse to accept
him. Send him on his way in peace so
that he may return to me. I am expecting
him along with the brothers.
12Now about our brother Apollos: I
strongly urged him to go to you with the
brothers. He was quite unwilling to go
now, but he will go when he has the
opportunity.
13Be on your guard; stand firm in the
faith; be men of courage; be strong.
14Do everything in love.
15You know that the household of
Stephanas were the first converts in
Achaia, and they have devoted
themselves to the service of the saints. I
urge you, brothers,
16to submit to such as these and to
everyone who joins in the work, and
labors at it.
17I was glad when Stephanas,
Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived,
because they have supplied what was
lacking from you.
18For they refreshed my spirit and yours
also. Such men deserve recognition.
19The churches in the province of Asia
send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla
greet you warmly in the Lord, and so
does the church that meets at their
house.
20All the brothers here send you
greetings. Greet one another with a holy
kiss.
21I, Paul, write this greeting in my own
hand.
22If anyone does not love the Lord--a
curse be on him. Come, O Lord !
23The grace of the Lord Jesus be with
you.
24My love to all of you in Christ Jesus.
Amen.
2nd Corinthians
1Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by
the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
To the church of God in Corinth,
together with all the saints throughout
Achaia:
2Grace and peace to you from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3Praise be to the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
compassion and the God of all comfort,
4who comforts us in all our troubles, so
that we can comfort those in any trouble
with the comfort we ourselves have
received from God.
5For just as the sufferings of Christ flow
over into our lives, so also through
Christ our comfort overflows.
6If we are distressed, it is for your
comfort and salvation; if we are
comforted, it is for your comfort, which
produces in you patient endurance of
the same sufferings we suffer.
7And our hope for you is firm, because
we know that just as you share in our
sufferings, so also you share in our
comfort.
8We do not want you to be uninformed,
brothers, about the hardships we
suffered in the province of Asia. We
were under great pressure, far beyond
our ability to endure, so that we
despaired even of life.
9Indeed, in our hearts we felt the
sentence of death. But this happened
that we might not rely on ourselves but
on God, who raises the dead.
10He has delivered us from such a
deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On
him we have set our hope that he will
continue to deliver us,
11as you help us by your prayers. Then
many will give thanks on our behalf for
the gracious favor granted us in answer
to the prayers of many.
12Now this is our boast: Our conscience
testifies that we have conducted
ourselves in the world, and especially in
our relations with you, in the holiness
and sincerity that are from God. We
have done so not according to worldly
wisdom but according to God's grace.
13For we do not write you anything you
cannot read or understand. And I hope
that,
14as you have understood us in part, you
will come to understand fully that you
can boast of us just as we will boast of
you in the day of the Lord Jesus.
15Because I was confident of this, I
planned to visit you first so that you
might benefit twice.
16I planned to visit you on my way to
Macedonia and to come back to you
from Macedonia, and then to have you
send me on my way to Judea.
17When I planned this, did I do it lightly?
Or do I make my plans in a worldly
manner so that in the same breath I say,
"Yes, yes" and "No, no"?
18But as surely as God is faithful, our
message to you is not "Yes" and "No."
19For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who
was preached among you by me and
Silas and Timothy, was not "Yes" and
"No," but in him it has always been
"Yes."
20For no matter how many promises
God has made, they are "Yes" in Christ.
And so through him the "Amen" is
spoken by us to the glory of God.
21Now it is God who makes both us and
you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,
22set his seal of ownership on us, and
put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit,
guaranteeing what is to come.
23I call God as my witness that it was in
order to spare you that I did not return to
Corinth.
24Not that we lord it over your faith, but
we work with you for your joy, because it
is by faith you stand firm.
2So I made up my mind that I would
not make another painful visit to you.
2For if I grieve you, who is left to make
me glad but you whom I have grieved?
3I wrote as I did so that when I came I
should not be distressed by those who
ought to make me rejoice. I had
confidence in all of you, that you would
all share my joy.
4For I wrote you out of great distress
and anguish of heart and with many
tears, not to grieve you but to let you
know the depth of my love for you.
5If anyone has caused grief, he has not
so much grieved me as he has grieved
all of you, to some extent--not to put it
too severely.
6The punishment inflicted on him by the
majority is sufficient for him.
7Now instead, you ought to forgive and
comfort him, so that he will not be
overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
8I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your
love for him.
9The reason I wrote you was to see if
you would stand the test and be
obedient in everything.
10If you forgive anyone, I also forgive
him. And what I have forgiven--if there
was anything to forgive--I have forgiven
in the sight of Christ for your sake,
11in order that Satan might not outwit us.
For we are not unaware of his schemes.
12Now when I went to Troas to preach
the gospel of Christ and found that the
Lord had opened a door for me,
13I still had no peace of mind, because I
did not find my brother Titus there. So I
said good-by to them and went on to
Macedonia.
14But thanks be to God, who always
leads us in triumphal procession in
Christ and through us spreads
everywhere the fragrance of the
knowledge of him.
15For we are to God the aroma of Christ
among those who are being saved and
those who are perishing.
16To the one we are the smell of death;
to the other, the fragrance of life. And
who is equal to such a task?
17Unlike so many, we do not peddle the
word of God for profit. On the contrary,
in Christ we speak before God with
sincerity, like men sent from God.
3Are we beginning to commend
ourselves again? Or do we need, like
some people, letters of recommendation
to you or from you?
2You yourselves are our letter, written
on our hearts, known and read by
everybody.
3You show that you are a letter from
Christ, the result of our ministry, written
not with ink but with the Spirit of the
living God, not on tablets of stone but on
tablets of human hearts.
4Such confidence as this is ours through
Christ before God.
5Not that we are competent in ourselves
to claim anything for ourselves, but our
competence comes from God.
6He has made us competent as
ministers of a new covenant--not of the
letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills,
but the Spirit gives life.
7Now if the ministry that brought death,
which was engraved in letters on stone,
came with glory, so that the Israelites
could not look steadily at the face of
Moses because of its glory, fading
though it was,
8will not the ministry of the Spirit be even
more glorious?
9If the ministry that condemns men is
glorious, how much more glorious is the
ministry that brings righteousness!
10For what was glorious has no glory
now in comparison with the surpassing
glory.
11And if what was fading away came
with glory, how much greater is the glory
of that which lasts!
12Therefore, since we have such a hope,
we are very bold.
13We are not like Moses, who would put
a veil over his face to keep the Israelites
from gazing at it while the radiance was
fading away.
14But their minds were made dull, for to
this day the same veil remains when the
old covenant is read. It has not been
removed, because only in Christ is it
taken away.
15Even to this day when Moses is read,
a veil covers their hearts.
16But whenever anyone turns to the Lord,
the veil is taken away.
17Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where
the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
18And we, who with unveiled faces all
reflect the Lord's glory, are being
transformed into his likeness with everincreasing
glory, which comes from the
Lord, who is the Spirit.
4Therefore, since through God's
mercy we have this ministry, we do not
lose heart.
2Rather, we have renounced secret and
shameful ways; we do not use
deception, nor do we distort the word of
God. On the contrary, by setting forth
the truth plainly we commend ourselves
to every man's conscience in the sight of
God.
3And even if our gospel is veiled, it is
veiled to those who are perishing.
4The god of this age has blinded the
minds of unbelievers, so that they
cannot see the light of the gospel of the
glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
5For we do not preach ourselves, but
Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as
your servants for Jesus' sake.
6For God, who said, "Let light shine out
of darkness," made his light shine in our
hearts to give us the light of the
knowledge of the glory of God in the
face of Christ.
7But we have this treasure in jars of clay
to show that this all-surpassing power is
from God and not from us.
8We are hard pressed on every side, but
not crushed; perplexed, but not in
despair;
9persecuted, but not abandoned; struck
down, but not destroyed.
10We always carry around in our body
the death of Jesus, so that the life of
Jesus may also be revealed in our body.
11For we who are alive are always being
given over to death for Jesus' sake, so
that his life may be revealed in our
mortal body.
12So then, death is at work in us, but life
is at work in you.
13It is written: "I believed; therefore I
have spoken." With that same spirit of
faith we also believe and therefore
speak,
14because we know that the one who
raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will
also raise us with Jesus and present us
with you in his presence.
15All this is for your benefit, so that the
grace that is reaching more and more
people may cause thanksgiving to
overflow to the glory of God.
16Therefore we do not lose heart.
Though outwardly we are wasting away,
yet inwardly we are being renewed day
by day.
17For our light and momentary troubles
are achieving for us an eternal glory that
far outweighs them all.
18So we fix our eyes not on what is seen,
but on what is unseen. For what is seen
is temporary, but what is unseen is
eternal.
5Now we know that if the earthly tent
we live in is destroyed, we have a
building from God, an eternal house in
heaven, not built by human hands.
2Meanwhile we groan, longing to be
clothed with our heavenly dwelling,
3because when we are clothed, we will
not be found naked.
4For while we are in this tent, we groan
and are burdened, because we do not
wish to be unclothed but to be clothed
with our heavenly dwelling, so that what
is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
5Now it is God who has made us for this
very purpose and has given us the Spirit
as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to
come.
6Therefore we are always confident and
know that as long as we are at home in
the body we are away from the Lord.
7We live by faith, not by sight.
8We are confident, I say, and would
prefer to be away from the body and at
home with the Lord.
9So we make it our goal to please him,
whether we are at home in the body or
away from it.
10For we must all appear before the
judgment seat of Christ, that each one
may receive what is due him for the
things done while in the body, whether
good or bad.
11Since, then, we know what it is to fear
the Lord, we try to persuade men. What
we are is plain to God, and I hope it is
also plain to your conscience.
12We are not trying to commend
ourselves to you again, but are giving
you an opportunity to take pride in us,
so that you can answer those who take
pride in what is seen rather than in what
is in the heart.
13If we are out of our mind, it is for the
sake of God; if we are in our right mind,
it is for you.
14For Christ's love compels us, because
we are convinced that one died for all,
and therefore all died.
15And he died for all, that those who live
should no longer live for themselves but
for him who died for them and was
raised again.
16So from now on we regard no one
from a worldly point of view. Though we
once regarded Christ in this way, we do
so no longer.
17Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is
a new creation; the old has gone, the
new has come!
18All this is from God, who reconciled us
to himself through Christ and gave us
the ministry of reconciliation:
19that God was reconciling the world to
himself in Christ, not counting men's
sins against them. And he has
committed to us the message of
reconciliation.
20We are therefore Christ's
ambassadors, as though God were
making his appeal through us. We
implore you on Christ's behalf: Be
reconciled to God.
21God made him who had no sin to be
sin for us, so that in him we might
become the righteousness of God.
6As God's fellow workers we urge you
not to receive God's grace in vain.
2For he says, "In the time of my favor I
heard you, and in the day of salvation I
helped you." I tell you, now is the time of
God's favor, now is the day of salvation.
3We put no stumbling block in anyone's
path, so that our ministry will not be
discredited.
4Rather, as servants of God we
commend ourselves in every way: in
great endurance; in troubles, hardships
and distresses;
5in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in
hard work, sleepless nights and hunger;
6in purity, understanding, patience and
kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in
sincere love;
7in truthful speech and in the power of
God; with weapons of righteousness in
the right hand and in the left;
8through glory and dishonor, bad report
and good report; genuine, yet regarded
as impostors;
9known, yet regarded as unknown; dying,
and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not
killed;
10sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor,
yet making many rich; having nothing,
and yet possessing everything.
11We have spoken freely to you,
Corinthians, and opened wide our
hearts to you.
12We are not withholding our affection
from you, but you are withholding yours
from us.
13As a fair exchange--I speak as to my
children--open wide your hearts also.
14Do not be yoked together with
unbelievers. For what do righteousness
and wickedness have in common? Or
what fellowship can light have with
darkness?
15What harmony is there between Christ
and Belial ? What does a believer have
in common with an unbeliever?
16What agreement is there between the
temple of God and idols? For we are the
temple of the living God. As God has
said: "I will live with them and walk
among them, and I will be their God,
and they will be my people."
17"Therefore come out from them and be
separate, says the Lord. Touch no
unclean thing, and I will receive you."
18"I will be a Father to you, and you will
be my sons and daughters, says the
Lord Almighty."
7Since we have these promises, dear
friends, let us purify ourselves from
everything that contaminates body and
spirit, perfecting holiness out of
reverence for God.
2Make room for us in your hearts. We
have wronged no one, we have
corrupted no one, we have exploited no
one.
3I do not say this to condemn you; I
have said before that you have such a
place in our hearts that we would live or
die with you.
4I have great confidence in you; I take
great pride in you. I am greatly
encouraged; in all our troubles my joy
knows no bounds.
5For when we came into Macedonia, this
body of ours had no rest, but we were
harassed at every turn--conflicts on the
outside, fears within.
6But God, who comforts the downcast,
comforted us by the coming of Titus,
7and not only by his coming but also by
the comfort you had given him. He told
us about your longing for me, your deep
sorrow, your ardent concern for me, so
that my joy was greater than ever.
8Even if I caused you sorrow by my
letter, I do not regret it. Though I did
regret it--I see that my letter hurt you,
but only for a little while--
9yet now I am happy, not because you
were made sorry, but because your
sorrow led you to repentance. For you
became sorrowful as God intended and
so were not harmed in any way by us.
10Godly sorrow brings repentance that
leads to salvation and leaves no regret,
but worldly sorrow brings death.
11See what this godly sorrow has
produced in you: what earnestness,
what eagerness to clear yourselves,
what indignation, what alarm, what
longing, what concern, what readiness
to see justice done. At every point you
have proved yourselves to be innocent
in this matter.
12So even though I wrote to you, it was
not on account of the one who did the
wrong or of the injured party, but rather
that before God you could see for
yourselves how devoted to us you are.
13By all this we are encouraged.
14In addition to our own encouragement,
we were especially delighted to see how
happy Titus was, because his spirit has
been refreshed by all of you. I had
boasted to him about you, and you have
not embarrassed me. But just as
everything we said to you was true, so
our boasting about you to Titus has
proved to be true as well.
15And his affection for you is all the
greater when he remembers that you
were all obedient, receiving him with
fear and trembling.
16I am glad I can have complete
confidence in you.
8And now, brothers, we want you to
know about the grace that God has
given the Macedonian churches.
2Out of the most severe trial, their
overflowing joy and their extreme
poverty welled up in rich generosity.
3For I testify that they gave as much as
they were able, and even beyond their
ability. Entirely on their own,
4they urgently pleaded with us for the
privilege of sharing in this service to the
saints.
5And they did not do as we expected,
but they gave themselves first to the
Lord and then to us in keeping with
God's will.
6So we urged Titus, since he had earlier
made a beginning, to bring also to
completion this act of grace on your part.
7But just as you excel in everything--in
faith, in speech, in knowledge, in
complete earnestness and in your love
for us --see that you also excel in this
grace of giving.
8I am not commanding you, but I want to
test the sincerity of your love by
comparing it with the earnestness of
others.
9For you know the grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ, that though he was rich,
yet for your sakes he became poor, so
that you through his poverty might
become rich.
10And here is my advice about what is
best for you in this matter: Last year you
were the first not only to give but also to
have the desire to do so.
11Now finish the work, so that your
eager willingness to do it may be
matched by your completion of it,
according to your means.
12For if the willingness is there, the gift is
acceptable according to what one has,
not according to what he does not have.
13Our desire is not that others might be
relieved while you are hard pressed, but
that there might be equality.
14At the present time your plenty will
supply what they need, so that in turn
their plenty will supply what you need.
Then there will be equality,
15as it is written: "He who gathered
much did not have too much, and he
who gathered little did not have too
little."
16I thank God, who put into the heart of
Titus the same concern I have for you.
17For Titus not only welcomed our
appeal, but he is coming to you with
much enthusiasm and on his own
initiative.
18And we are sending along with him the
brother who is praised by all the
churches for his service to the gospel.
19What is more, he was chosen by the
churches to accompany us as we carry
the offering, which we administer in
order to honor the Lord himself and to
show our eagerness to help.
20We want to avoid any criticism of the
way we administer this liberal gift.
21For we are taking pains to do what is
right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but
also in the eyes of men.
22In addition, we are sending with them
our brother who has often proved to us
in many ways that he is zealous, and
now even more so because of his great
confidence in you.
23As for Titus, he is my partner and
fellow worker among you; as for our
brothers, they are representatives of the
churches and an honor to Christ.
24Therefore show these men the proof of
your love and the reason for our pride in
you, so that the churches can see it.
9There is no need for me to write to
you about this service to the saints.
2For I know your eagerness to help, and
I have been boasting about it to the
Macedonians, telling them that since
last year you in Achaia were ready to
give; and your enthusiasm has stirred
most of them to action.
3But I am sending the brothers in order
that our boasting about you in this
matter should not prove hollow, but that
you may be ready, as I said you would
be.
4For if any Macedonians come with me
and find you unprepared, we--not to say
anything about you--would be ashamed
of having been so confident.
5So I thought it necessary to urge the
brothers to visit you in advance and
finish the arrangements for the
generous gift you had promised. Then it
will be ready as a generous gift, not as
one grudgingly given.
6Remember this: Whoever sows
sparingly will also reap sparingly, and
whoever sows generously will also reap
generously.
7Each man should give what he has
decided in his heart to give, not
reluctantly or under compulsion, for God
loves a cheerful giver.
8And God is able to make all grace
abound to you, so that in all things at all
times, having all that you need, you will
abound in every good work.
9As it is written: "He has scattered
abroad his gifts to the poor; his
righteousness endures forever."
10Now he who supplies seed to the
sower and bread for food will also
supply and increase your store of seed
and will enlarge the harvest of your
righteousness.
11You will be made rich in every way so
that you can be generous on every
occasion, and through us your
generosity will result in thanksgiving to
God.
12This service that you perform is not
only supplying the needs of God's
people but is also overflowing in many
expressions of thanks to God.
13Because of the service by which you
have proved yourselves, men will praise
God for the obedience that
accompanies your confession of the
gospel of Christ, and for your generosity
in sharing with them and with everyone
else.
14And in their prayers for you their
hearts will go out to you, because of the
surpassing grace God has given you.
15Thanks be to God for his indescribable
gift!
10By the meekness and gentleness
of Christ, I appeal to you--I, Paul, who
am "timid" when face to face with you,
but "bold" when away!
2I beg you that when I come I may not
have to be as bold as I expect to be
toward some people who think that we
live by the standards of this world.
3For though we live in the world, we do
not wage war as the world does.
4The weapons we fight with are not the
weapons of the world. On the contrary,
they have divine power to demolish
strongholds.
5We demolish arguments and every
pretension that sets itself up against the
knowledge of God, and we take captive
every thought to make it obedient to
Christ.
6And we will be ready to punish every
act of disobedience, once your
obedience is complete.
7You are looking only on the surface of
things. If anyone is confident that he
belongs to Christ, he should consider
again that we belong to Christ just as
much as he.
8For even if I boast somewhat freely
about the authority the Lord gave us for
building you up rather than pulling you
down, I will not be ashamed of it.
9I do not want to seem to be trying to
frighten you with my letters.
10For some say, "His letters are weighty
and forceful, but in person he is
unimpressive and his speaking amounts
to nothing."
11Such people should realize that what
we are in our letters when we are
absent, we will be in our actions when
we are present.
12We do not dare to classify or compare
ourselves with some who commend
themselves. When they measure
themselves by themselves and compare
themselves with themselves, they are
not wise.
13We, however, will not boast beyond
proper limits, but will confine our
boasting to the field God has assigned
to us, a field that reaches even to you.
14We are not going too far in our
boasting, as would be the case if we
had not come to you, for we did get as
far as you with the gospel of Christ.
15Neither do we go beyond our limits by
boasting of work done by others. Our
hope is that, as your faith continues to
grow, our area of activity among you will
greatly expand,
16so that we can preach the gospel in
the regions beyond you. For we do not
want to boast about work already done
in another man's territory.
17But, "Let him who boasts boast in the
Lord."
18For it is not the one who commends
himself who is approved, but the one
whom the Lord commends.
11I hope you will put up with a little
of my foolishness; but you are already
doing that.
2I am jealous for you with a godly
jealousy. I promised you to one husband,
to Christ, so that I might present you as
a pure virgin to him.
3But I am afraid that just as Eve was
deceived by the serpent's cunning, your
minds may somehow be led astray from
your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.
4For if someone comes to you and
preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus
we preached, or if you receive a
different spirit from the one you received,
or a different gospel from the one you
accepted, you put up with it easily
enough.
5But I do not think I am in the least
inferior to those "super-apostles."
6I may not be a trained speaker, but I do
have knowledge. We have made this
perfectly clear to you in every way.
7Was it a sin for me to lower myself in
order to elevate you by preaching the
gospel of God to you free of charge?
8I robbed other churches by receiving
support from them so as to serve you.
9And when I was with you and needed
something, I was not a burden to
anyone, for the brothers who came from
Macedonia supplied what I needed. I
have kept myself from being a burden to
you in any way, and will continue to do
so.
10As surely as the truth of Christ is in me,
nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop
this boasting of mine.
11Why? Because I do not love you? God
knows I do!
12And I will keep on doing what I am
doing in order to cut the ground from
under those who want an opportunity to
be considered equal with us in the
things they boast about.
13For such men are false apostles,
deceitful workmen, masquerading as
apostles of Christ.
14And no wonder, for Satan himself
masquerades as an angel of light.
15It is not surprising, then, if his servants
masquerade as servants of
righteousness. Their end will be what
their actions deserve.
16I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool.
But if you do, then receive me just as
you would a fool, so that I may do a little
boasting.
17In this self-confident boasting I am not
talking as the Lord would, but as a fool.
18Since many are boasting in the way
the world does, I too will boast.
19You gladly put up with fools since you
are so wise!
20In fact, you even put up with anyone
who enslaves you or exploits you or
takes advantage of you or pushes
himself forward or slaps you in the face.
21To my shame I admit that we were too
weak for that!
22What anyone else dares to boast
about--I am speaking as a fool--I also
dare to boast about. Are they Hebrews?
So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I.
Are they Abraham's descendants? So
am I.
23Are they servants of Christ? (I am out
of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I
have worked much harder, been in
prison more frequently, been flogged
more severely, and been exposed to
death again and again.
24Five times I received from the Jews
the forty lashes minus one.
25Three times I was beaten with rods,
once I was stoned, three times I was
shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day
in the open sea,
26I have been constantly on the move. I
have been in danger from rivers, in
danger from bandits, in danger from my
own countrymen, in danger from
Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger
in the country, in danger at sea; and in
danger from false brothers.
27I have labored and toiled and have
often gone without sleep; I have known
hunger and thirst and have often gone
without food; I have been cold and
naked.
28Besides everything else, I face daily
the pressure of my concern for all the
churches.
29Who is weak, and I do not feel weak?
Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly
burn?
30If I must boast, I will boast of the things
that show my weakness.
31The God and Father of the Lord Jesus,
who is to be praised forever, knows that
I am not lying.
32In Damascus the governor under King
Aretas had the city of the Damascenes
guarded in order to arrest me.
33But I was lowered in a basket from a
window in the wall and slipped through
his hands.
12I must go on boasting. Although
there is nothing to be gained, I will go on
to visions and revelations from the Lord.
2I know a man in Christ who fourteen
years ago was caught up to the third
heaven. Whether it was in the body or
out of the body I do not know--God
knows.
3And I know that this man--whether in
the body or apart from the body I do not
know, but God knows--
4was caught up to paradise. He heard
inexpressible things, things that man is
not permitted to tell.
5I will boast about a man like that, but I
will not boast about myself, except
about my weaknesses.
6Even if I should choose to boast, I
would not be a fool, because I would be
speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no
one will think more of me than is
warranted by what I do or say.
7To keep me from becoming conceited
because of these surpassingly great
revelations, there was given me a thorn
in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to
torment me.
8Three times I pleaded with the Lord to
take it away from me.
9But he said to me, "My grace is
sufficient for you, for my power is made
perfect in weakness." Therefore I will
boast all the more gladly about my
weaknesses, so that Christ's power may
rest on me.
10That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight
in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships,
in persecutions, in difficulties. For when
I am weak, then I am strong.
11I have made a fool of myself, but you
drove me to it. I ought to have been
commended by you, for I am not in the
least inferior to the "super-apostles,"
even though I am nothing.
12The things that mark an apostle--signs,
wonders and miracles--were done
among you with great perseverance.
13How were you inferior to the other
churches, except that I was never a
burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!
14Now I am ready to visit you for the
third time, and I will not be a burden to
you, because what I want is not your
possessions but you. After all, children
should not have to save up for their
parents, but parents for their children.
15So I will very gladly spend for you
everything I have and expend myself as
well. If I love you more, will you love me
less?
16Be that as it may, I have not been a
burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I
am, I caught you by trickery!
17Did I exploit you through any of the
men I sent you?
18I urged Titus to go to you and I sent
our brother with him. Titus did not
exploit you, did he? Did we not act in the
same spirit and follow the same course?
19Have you been thinking all along that
we have been defending ourselves to
you? We have been speaking in the
sight of God as those in Christ; and
everything we do, dear friends, is for
your strengthening.
20For I am afraid that when I come I may
not find you as I want you to be, and you
may not find me as you want me to be. I
fear that there may be quarreling,
jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions,
slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder.
21I am afraid that when I come again my
God will humble me before you, and I
will be grieved over many who have
sinned earlier and have not repented of
the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery
in which they have indulged.
13This will be my third visit to you.
"Every matter must be established by
the testimony of two or three witnesses."
2I already gave you a warning when I
was with you the second time. I now
repeat it while absent: On my return I
will not spare those who sinned earlier
or any of the others,
3since you are demanding proof that
Christ is speaking through me. He is not
weak in dealing with you, but is powerful
among you.
4For to be sure, he was crucified in
weakness, yet he lives by God's power.
Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by
God's power we will live with him to
serve you.
5Examine yourselves to see whether
you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do
you not realize that Christ Jesus is in
you--unless, of course, you fail the test?
6And I trust that you will discover that we
have not failed the test.
7Now we pray to God that you will not do
anything wrong. Not that people will see
that we have stood the test but that you
will do what is right even though we may
seem to have failed.
8For we cannot do anything against the
truth, but only for the truth.
9We are glad whenever we are weak but
you are strong; and our prayer is for
your perfection.
10This is why I write these things when I
am absent, that when I come I may not
have to be harsh in my use of authority--
the authority the Lord gave me for
building you up, not for tearing you
down.
11Finally, brothers, good-by. Aim for
perfection, listen to my appeal, be of
one mind, live in peace. And the God of
love and peace will be with you.
12Greet one another with a holy kiss.
13All the saints send their greetings.
14May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and the love of God, and the fellowship
of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
Galatians
1Paul, an apostle--sent not from men
nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and
God the Father, who raised him from the
dead--
2and all the brothers with me, To the
churches in Galatia:
3Grace and peace to you from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
4who gave himself for our sins to rescue
us from the present evil age, according
to the will of our God and Father,
5to whom be glory for ever and ever.
Amen.
6I am astonished that you are so quickly
deserting the one who called you by the
grace of Christ and are turning to a
different gospel--
7which is really no gospel at all.
Evidently some people are throwing you
into confusion and are trying to pervert
the gospel of Christ.
8But even if we or an angel from heaven
should preach a gospel other than the
one we preached to you, let him be
eternally condemned!
9As we have already said, so now I say
again: If anybody is preaching to you a
gospel other than what you accepted, let
him be eternally condemned!
10Am I now trying to win the approval of
men, or of God? Or am I trying to please
men? If I were still trying to please men,
I would not be a servant of Christ.
11I want you to know, brothers, that the
gospel I preached is not something that
man made up.
12I did not receive it from any man, nor
was I taught it; rather, I received it by
revelation from Jesus Christ.
13For you have heard of my previous
way of life in Judaism, how intensely I
persecuted the church of God and tried
to destroy it.
14I was advancing in Judaism beyond
many Jews of my own age and was
extremely zealous for the traditions of
my fathers.
15But when God, who set me apart from
birth and called me by his grace, was
pleased
16to reveal his Son in me so that I might
preach him among the Gentiles, I did
not consult any man,
17nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see
those who were apostles before I was,
but I went immediately into Arabia and
later returned to Damascus.
18Then after three years, I went up to
Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter
and stayed with him fifteen days.
19I saw none of the other apostles--only
James, the Lord's brother.
20I assure you before God that what I
am writing you is no lie.
21Later I went to Syria and Cilicia.
22I was personally unknown to the
churches of Judea that are in Christ.
23They only heard the report: "The man
who formerly persecuted us is now
preaching the faith he once tried to
destroy."
24And they praised God because of me.
2Fourteen years later I went up again
to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I
took Titus along also.
2I went in response to a revelation and
set before them the gospel that I preach
among the Gentiles. But I did this
privately to those who seemed to be
leaders, for fear that I was running or
had run my race in vain.
3Yet not even Titus, who was with me,
was compelled to be circumcised, even
though he was a Greek.
4This matter arose because some false
brothers had infiltrated our ranks to spy
on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus
and to make us slaves.
5We did not give in to them for a
moment, so that the truth of the gospel
might remain with you.
6As for those who seemed to be
important--whatever they were makes
no difference to me; God does not judge
by external appearance--those men
added nothing to my message.
7On the contrary, they saw that I had
been entrusted with the task of
preaching the gospel to the Gentiles,
just as Peter had been to the Jews.
8For God, who was at work in the
ministry of Peter as an apostle to the
Jews, was also at work in my ministry as
an apostle to the Gentiles.
9James, Peter and John, those reputed
to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the
right hand of fellowship when they
recognized the grace given to me. They
agreed that we should go to the Gentiles,
and they to the Jews.
10All they asked was that we should
continue to remember the poor, the very
thing I was eager to do.
11When Peter came to Antioch, I
opposed him to his face, because he
was clearly in the wrong.
12Before certain men came from James,
he used to eat with the Gentiles. But
when they arrived, he began to draw
back and separate himself from the
Gentiles because he was afraid of those
who belonged to the circumcision group.
13The other Jews joined him in his
hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy
even Barnabas was led astray.
14When I saw that they were not acting
in line with the truth of the gospel, I said
to Peter in front of them all, "You are a
Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not
like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force
Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?
15"We who are Jews by birth and not
'Gentile sinners'
16know that a man is not justified by
observing the law, but by faith in Jesus
Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in
Christ Jesus that we may be justified by
faith in Christ and not by observing the
law, because by observing the law no
one will be justified.
17"If, while we seek to be justified in
Christ, it becomes evident that we
ourselves are sinners, does that mean
that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not!
18If I rebuild what I destroyed, I prove
that I am a lawbreaker.
19For through the law I died to the law so
that I might live for God.
20I have been crucified with Christ and I
no longer live, but Christ lives in me.
The life I live in the body, I live by faith in
the Son of God, who loved me and gave
himself for me.
21I do not set aside the grace of God, for
if righteousness could be gained
through the law, Christ died for nothing!"
3You foolish Galatians! Who has
bewitched you? Before your very eyes
Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as
crucified.
2I would like to learn just one thing from
you: Did you receive the Spirit by
observing the law, or by believing what
you heard?
3Are you so foolish? After beginning with
the Spirit, are you now trying to attain
your goal by human effort?
4Have you suffered so much for nothing-
-if it really was for nothing?
5Does God give you his Spirit and work
miracles among you because you
observe the law, or because you believe
what you heard?
6Consider Abraham: "He believed God,
and it was credited to him as
righteousness."
7Understand, then, that those who
believe are children of Abraham.
8The Scripture foresaw that God would
justify the Gentiles by faith, and
announced the gospel in advance to
Abraham: "All nations will be blessed
through you."
9So those who have faith are blessed
along with Abraham, the man of faith.
10All who rely on observing the law are
under a curse, for it is written: "Cursed is
everyone who does not continue to do
everything written in the Book of the
Law."
11Clearly no one is justified before God
by the law, because, "The righteous will
live by faith."
12The law is not based on faith; on the
contrary, "The man who does these
things will live by them."
13Christ redeemed us from the curse of
the law by becoming a curse for us, for it
is written: "Cursed is everyone who is
hung on a tree."
14He redeemed us in order that the
blessing given to Abraham might come
to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so
that by faith we might receive the
promise of the Spirit.
15Brothers, let me take an example from
everyday life. Just as no one can set
aside or add to a human covenant that
has been duly established, so it is in this
case.
16The promises were spoken to
Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture
does not say "and to seeds," meaning
many people, but "and to your seed,"
meaning one person, who is Christ.
17What I mean is this: The law,
introduced 430 years later, does not set
aside the covenant previously
established by God and thus do away
with the promise.
18For if the inheritance depends on the
law, then it no longer depends on a
promise; but God in his grace gave it to
Abraham through a promise.
19What, then, was the purpose of the
law? It was added because of
transgressions until the Seed to whom
the promise referred had come. The law
was put into effect through angels by a
mediator.
20A mediator, however, does not
represent just one party; but God is one.
21Is the law, therefore, opposed to the
promises of God? Absolutely not! For if
a law had been given that could impart
life, then righteousness would certainly
have come by the law.
22But the Scripture declares that the
whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that
what was promised, being given through
faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to
those who believe.
23Before this faith came, we were held
prisoners by the law, locked up until
faith should be revealed.
24So the law was put in charge to lead
us to Christ that we might be justified by
faith.
25Now that faith has come, we are no
longer under the supervision of the law.
26You are all sons of God through faith
in Christ Jesus,
27for all of you who were baptized into
Christ have clothed yourselves with
Christ.
28There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave
nor free, male nor female, for you are all
one in Christ Jesus.
29If you belong to Christ, then you are
Abraham's seed, and heirs according to
the promise.
4What I am saying is that as long as
the heir is a child, he is no different from
a slave, although he owns the whole
estate.
2He is subject to guardians and trustees
until the time set by his father.
3So also, when we were children, we
were in slavery under the basic
principles of the world.
4But when the time had fully come, God
sent his Son, born of a woman, born
under law,
5to redeem those under law, that we
might receive the full rights of sons.
6Because you are sons, God sent the
Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the
Spirit who calls out, "Abba, Father."
7So you are no longer a slave, but a
son; and since you are a son, God has
made you also an heir.
8Formerly, when you did not know God,
you were slaves to those who by nature
are not gods.
9But now that you know God--or rather
are known by God--how is it that you are
turning back to those weak and
miserable principles? Do you wish to be
enslaved by them all over again?
10You are observing special days and
months and seasons and years!
11I fear for you, that somehow I have
wasted my efforts on you.
12I plead with you, brothers, become like
me, for I became like you. You have
done me no wrong.
13As you know, it was because of an
illness that I first preached the gospel to
you.
14Even though my illness was a trial to
you, you did not treat me with contempt
or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as
if I were an angel of God, as if I were
Christ Jesus himself.
15What has happened to all your joy? I
can testify that, if you could have done
so, you would have torn out your eyes
and given them to me.
16Have I now become your enemy by
telling you the truth?
17Those people are zealous to win you
over, but for no good. What they want is
to alienate you from us, so that you may
be zealous for them.
18It is fine to be zealous, provided the
purpose is good, and to be so always
and not just when I am with you.
19My dear children, for whom I am again
in the pains of childbirth until Christ is
formed in you,
20how I wish I could be with you now
and change my tone, because I am
perplexed about you!
21Tell me, you who want to be under the
law, are you not aware of what the law
says?
22For it is written that Abraham had two
sons, one by the slave woman and the
other by the free woman.
23His son by the slave woman was born
in the ordinary way; but his son by the
free woman was born as the result of a
promise.
24These things may be taken figuratively,
for the women represent two covenants.
One covenant is from Mount Sinai and
bears children who are to be slaves:
This is Hagar.
25Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in
Arabia and corresponds to the present
city of Jerusalem, because she is in
slavery with her children.
26But the Jerusalem that is above is free,
and she is our mother.
27For it is written: "Be glad, O barren
woman, who bears no children; break
forth and cry aloud, you who have no
labor pains; because more are the
children of the desolate woman than of
her who has a husband."
28Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are
children of promise.
29At that time the son born in the
ordinary way persecuted the son born
by the power of the Spirit. It is the same
now.
30But what does the Scripture say? "Get
rid of the slave woman and her son, for
the slave woman's son will never share
in the inheritance with the free woman's
son."
31Therefore, brothers, we are not
children of the slave woman, but of the
free woman.
5It is for freedom that Christ has set us
free. Stand firm, then, and do not let
yourselves be burdened again by a yoke
of slavery.
2Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if
you let yourselves be circumcised,
Christ will be of no value to you at all.
3Again I declare to every man who lets
himself be circumcised that he is
obligated to obey the whole law.
4You who are trying to be justified by law
have been alienated from Christ; you
have fallen away from grace.
5But by faith we eagerly await through
the Spirit the righteousness for which we
hope.
6For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
nor uncircumcision has any value. The
only thing that counts is faith expressing
itself through love.
7You were running a good race. Who cut
in on you and kept you from obeying the
truth?
8That kind of persuasion does not come
from the one who calls you.
9"A little yeast works through the whole
batch of dough."
10I am confident in the Lord that you will
take no other view. The one who is
throwing you into confusion will pay the
penalty, whoever he may be.
11Brothers, if I am still preaching
circumcision, why am I still being
persecuted? In that case the offense of
the cross has been abolished.
12As for those agitators, I wish they
would go the whole way and emasculate
themselves!
13You, my brothers, were called to be
free. But do not use your freedom to
indulge the sinful nature ; rather, serve
one another in love.
14The entire law is summed up in a
single command: "Love your neighbor
as yourself."
15If you keep on biting and devouring
each other, watch out or you will be
destroyed by each other.
16So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will
not gratify the desires of the sinful
nature.
17For the sinful nature desires what is
contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what
is contrary to the sinful nature. They are
in conflict with each other, so that you
do not do what you want.
18But if you are led by the Spirit, you are
not under law.
19The acts of the sinful nature are
obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and
debauchery;
20idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord,
jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition,
dissensions, factions
21and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and
the like. I warn you, as I did before, that
those who live like this will not inherit the
kingdom of God.
22But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
faithfulness,
23gentleness and self-control. Against
such things there is no law.
24Those who belong to Christ Jesus
have crucified the sinful nature with its
passions and desires.
25Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep
in step with the Spirit.
26Let us not become conceited,
provoking and envying each other.
6Brothers, if someone is caught in a
sin, you who are spiritual should restore
him gently. But watch yourself, or you
also may be tempted.
2Carry each other's burdens, and in this
way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
3If anyone thinks he is something when
he is nothing, he deceives himself.
4Each one should test his own actions.
Then he can take pride in himself,
without comparing himself to somebody
else,
5for each one should carry his own load.
6Anyone who receives instruction in the
word must share all good things with his
instructor.
7Do not be deceived: God cannot be
mocked. A man reaps what he sows.
8The one who sows to please his sinful
nature, from that nature will reap
destruction; the one who sows to please
the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap
eternal life.
9Let us not become weary in doing good,
for at the proper time we will reap a
harvest if we do not give up.
10Therefore, as we have opportunity, let
us do good to all people, especially to
those who belong to the family of
believers.
11See what large letters I use as I write
to you with my own hand!
12Those who want to make a good
impression outwardly are trying to
compel you to be circumcised. The only
reason they do this is to avoid being
persecuted for the cross of Christ.
13Not even those who are circumcised
obey the law, yet they want you to be
circumcised that they may boast about
your flesh.
14May I never boast except in the cross
of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which
the world has been crucified to me, and
I to the world.
15Neither circumcision nor
uncircumcision means anything; what
counts is a new creation.
16Peace and mercy to all who follow this
rule, even to the Israel of God.
17Finally, let no one cause me trouble,
for I bear on my body the marks of
Jesus.
18The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
Ephesians
1Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by
the will of God, To the saints in Ephesus,
the faithful in Christ Jesus:
2Grace and peace to you from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3Praise be to the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us
in the heavenly realms with every
spiritual blessing in Christ.
4For he chose us in him before the
creation of the world to be holy and
blameless in his sight. In love
5he predestined us to be adopted as his
sons through Jesus Christ, in
accordance with his pleasure and will--
6to the praise of his glorious grace,
which he has freely given us in the One
he loves.
7In him we have redemption through his
blood, the forgiveness of sins, in
accordance with the riches of God's
grace
8that he lavished on us with all wisdom
and understanding.
9And he made known to us the mystery
of his will according to his good pleasure,
which he purposed in Christ,
10to be put into effect when the times will
have reached their fulfillment--to bring
all things in heaven and on earth
together under one head, even Christ.
11In him we were also chosen, having
been predestined according to the plan
of him who works out everything in
conformity with the purpose of his will,
12in order that we, who were the first to
hope in Christ, might be for the praise of
his glory.
13And you also were included in Christ
when you heard the word of truth, the
gospel of your salvation. Having
believed, you were marked in him with a
seal, the promised Holy Spirit,
14who is a deposit guaranteeing our
inheritance until the redemption of those
who are God's possession--to the praise
of his glory.
15For this reason, ever since I heard
about your faith in the Lord Jesus and
your love for all the saints,
16I have not stopped giving thanks for
you, remembering you in my prayers.
17I keep asking that the God of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may
give you the Spirit of wisdom and
revelation, so that you may know him
better.
18I pray also that the eyes of your heart
may be enlightened in order that you
may know the hope to which he has
called you, the riches of his glorious
inheritance in the saints,
19and his incomparably great power for
us who believe. That power is like the
working of his mighty strength,
20which he exerted in Christ when he
raised him from the dead and seated
him at his right hand in the heavenly
realms,
21far above all rule and authority, power
and dominion, and every title that can
be given, not only in the present age but
also in the one to come.
22And God placed all things under his
feet and appointed him to be head over
everything for the church,
23which is his body, the fullness of him
who fills everything in every way.
2As for you, you were dead in your
transgressions and sins,
2in which you used to live when you
followed the ways of this world and of
the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the
spirit who is now at work in those who
are disobedient.
3All of us also lived among them at one
time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful
nature and following its desires and
thoughts. Like the rest, we were by
nature objects of wrath.
4But because of his great love for us,
God, who is rich in mercy,
5made us alive with Christ even when
we were dead in transgressions--it is by
grace you have been saved.
6And God raised us up with Christ and
seated us with him in the heavenly
realms in Christ Jesus,
7in order that in the coming ages he
might show the incomparable riches of
his grace, expressed in his kindness to
us in Christ Jesus.
8For it is by grace you have been saved,
through faith--and this not from
yourselves, it is the gift of God--
9not by works, so that no one can boast.
10For we are God's workmanship,
created in Christ Jesus to do good
works, which God prepared in advance
for us to do.
11Therefore, remember that formerly you
who are Gentiles by birth and called
"uncircumcised" by those who call
themselves "the circumcision" (that done
in the body by the hands of men)--
12remember that at that time you were
separate from Christ, excluded from
citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the
covenants of the promise, without hope
and without God in the world.
13But now in Christ Jesus you who once
were far away have been brought near
through the blood of Christ.
14For he himself is our peace, who has
made the two one and has destroyed
the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,
15by abolishing in his flesh the law with
its commandments and regulations. His
purpose was to create in himself one
new man out of the two, thus making
peace,
16and in this one body to reconcile both
of them to God through the cross, by
which he put to death their hostility.
17He came and preached peace to you
who were far away and peace to those
who were near.
18For through him we both have access
to the Father by one Spirit.
19Consequently, you are no longer
foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens
with God's people and members of
God's household,
20built on the foundation of the apostles
and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself
as the chief cornerstone.
21In him the whole building is joined
together and rises to become a holy
temple in the Lord.
22And in him you too are being built
together to become a dwelling in which
God lives by his Spirit.
3For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner
of Christ Jesus for the sake of you
Gentiles--
2Surely you have heard about the
administration of God's grace that was
given to me for you,
3that is, the mystery made known to me
by revelation, as I have already written
briefly.
4In reading this, then, you will be able to
understand my insight into the mystery
of Christ,
5which was not made known to men in
other generations as it has now been
revealed by the Spirit to God's holy
apostles and prophets.
6This mystery is that through the gospel
the Gentiles are heirs together with
Israel, members together of one body,
and sharers together in the promise in
Christ Jesus.
7I became a servant of this gospel by
the gift of God's grace given me through
the working of his power.
8Although I am less than the least of all
God's people, this grace was given me:
to preach to the Gentiles the
unsearchable riches of Christ,
9and to make plain to everyone the
administration of this mystery, which for
ages past was kept hidden in God, who
created all things.
10His intent was that now, through the
church, the manifold wisdom of God
should be made known to the rulers and
authorities in the heavenly realms,
11according to his eternal purpose which
he accomplished in Christ Jesus our
Lord.
12In him and through faith in him we may
approach God with freedom and
confidence.
13I ask you, therefore, not to be
discouraged because of my sufferings
for you, which are your glory.
14For this reason I kneel before the
Father,
15from whom his whole family in heaven
and on earth derives its name.
16I pray that out of his glorious riches he
may strengthen you with power through
his Spirit in your inner being,
17so that Christ may dwell in your hearts
through faith. And I pray that you, being
rooted and established in love,
18may have power, together with all the
saints, to grasp how wide and long and
high and deep is the love of Christ,
19and to know this love that surpasses
knowledge--that you may be filled to the
measure of all the fullness of God.
20Now to him who is able to do
immeasurably more than all we ask or
imagine, according to his power that is
at work within us,
21to him be glory in the church and in
Christ Jesus throughout all generations,
for ever and ever! Amen.
4As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I
urge you to live a life worthy of the
calling you have received.
2Be completely humble and gentle; be
patient, bearing with one another in love.
3Make every effort to keep the unity of
the Spirit through the bond of peace.
4There is one body and one Spirit--just
as you were called to one hope when
you were called--
5one Lord, one faith, one baptism;
6one God and Father of all, who is over
all and through all and in all.
7But to each one of us grace has been
given as Christ apportioned it.
8This is why it says: "When he ascended
on high, he led captives in his train and
gave gifts to men."
9(What does "he ascended" mean
except that he also descended to the
lower, earthly regions ?
10He who descended is the very one
who ascended higher than all the
heavens, in order to fill the whole
universe.)
11It was he who gave some to be
apostles, some to be prophets, some to
be evangelists, and some to be pastors
and teachers,
12to prepare God's people for works of
service, so that the body of Christ may
be built up
13until we all reach unity in the faith and
in the knowledge of the Son of God and
become mature, attaining to the whole
measure of the fullness of Christ.
14Then we will no longer be infants,
tossed back and forth by the waves, and
blown here and there by every wind of
teaching and by the cunning and
craftiness of men in their deceitful
scheming.
15Instead, speaking the truth in love, we
will in all things grow up into him who is
the Head, that is, Christ.
16From him the whole body, joined and
held together by every supporting
ligament, grows and builds itself up in
love, as each part does its work.
17So I tell you this, and insist on it in the
Lord, that you must no longer live as the
Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.
18They are darkened in their
understanding and separated from the
life of God because of the ignorance
that is in them due to the hardening of
their hearts.
19Having lost all sensitivity, they have
given themselves over to sensuality so
as to indulge in every kind of impurity,
with a continual lust for more.
20You, however, did not come to know
Christ that way.
21Surely you heard of him and were
taught in him in accordance with the
truth that is in Jesus.
22You were taught, with regard to your
former way of life, to put off your old self,
which is being corrupted by its deceitful
desires;
23to be made new in the attitude of your
minds;
24and to put on the new self, created to
be like God in true righteousness and
holiness.
25Therefore each of you must put off
falsehood and speak truthfully to his
neighbor, for we are all members of one
body.
26"In your anger do not sin" : Do not let
the sun go down while you are still
angry,
27and do not give the devil a foothold.
28He who has been stealing must steal
no longer, but must work, doing
something useful with his own hands,
that he may have something to share
with those in need.
29Do not let any unwholesome talk come
out of your mouths, but only what is
helpful for building others up according
to their needs, that it may benefit those
who listen.
30And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of
God, with whom you were sealed for the
day of redemption.
31Get rid of all bitterness, rage and
anger, brawling and slander, along with
every form of malice.
32Be kind and compassionate to one
another, forgiving each other, just as in
Christ God forgave you.
5Be imitators of God, therefore, as
dearly loved children
2and live a life of love, just as Christ
loved us and gave himself up for us as a
fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
3But among you there must not be even
a hint of sexual immorality, or of any
kind of impurity, or of greed, because
these are improper for God's holy
people.
4Nor should there be obscenity, foolish
talk or coarse joking, which are out of
place, but rather thanksgiving.
5For of this you can be sure: No immoral,
impure or greedy person--such a man is
an idolater--has any inheritance in the
kingdom of Christ and of God.
6Let no one deceive you with empty
words, for because of such things God's
wrath comes on those who are
disobedient.
7Therefore do not be partners with them.
8For you were once darkness, but now
you are light in the Lord. Live as children
of light
9(for the fruit of the light consists in all
goodness, righteousness and truth)
10and find out what pleases the Lord.
11Have nothing to do with the fruitless
deeds of darkness, but rather expose
them.
12For it is shameful even to mention
what the disobedient do in secret.
13But everything exposed by the light
becomes visible,
14for it is light that makes everything
visible. This is why it is said: "Wake up,
O sleeper, rise from the dead, and
Christ will shine on you."
15Be very careful, then, how you live--
not as unwise but as wise,
16making the most of every opportunity,
because the days are evil.
17Therefore do not be foolish, but
understand what the Lord's will is.
18Do not get drunk on wine, which leads
to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the
Spirit.
19Speak to one another with psalms,
hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and
make music in your heart to the Lord,
20always giving thanks to God the
Father for everything, in the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ.
21Submit to one another out of
reverence for Christ.
22Wives, submit to your husbands as to
the Lord.
23For the husband is the head of the
wife as Christ is the head of the church,
his body, of which he is the Savior.
24Now as the church submits to Christ,
so also wives should submit to their
husbands in everything.
25Husbands, love your wives, just as
Christ loved the church and gave
himself up for her
26to make her holy, cleansing her by the
washing with water through the word,
27and to present her to himself as a
radiant church, without stain or wrinkle
or any other blemish, but holy and
blameless.
28In this same way, husbands ought to
love their wives as their own bodies. He
who loves his wife loves himself.
29After all, no one ever hated his own
body, but he feeds and cares for it, just
as Christ does the church--
30for we are members of his body.
31"For this reason a man will leave his
father and mother and be united to his
wife, and the two will become one flesh."
32This is a profound mystery--but I am
talking about Christ and the church.
33However, each one of you also must
love his wife as he loves himself, and
the wife must respect her husband.
6Children, obey your parents in the
Lord, for this is right.
2"Honor your father and mother"--which
is the first commandment with a
promise--
3"that it may go well with you and that
you may enjoy long life on the earth."
4Fathers, do not exasperate your
children; instead, bring them up in the
training and instruction of the Lord.
5Slaves, obey your earthly masters with
respect and fear, and with sincerity of
heart, just as you would obey Christ.
6Obey them not only to win their favor
when their eye is on you, but like slaves
of Christ, doing the will of God from your
heart.
7Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were
serving the Lord, not men,
8because you know that the Lord will
reward everyone for whatever good he
does, whether he is slave or free.
9And masters, treat your slaves in the
same way. Do not threaten them, since
you know that he who is both their
Master and yours is in heaven, and
there is no favoritism with him.
10Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his
mighty power.
11Put on the full armor of God so that
you can take your stand against the
devil's schemes.
12For our struggle is not against flesh
and blood, but against the rulers,
against the authorities, against the
powers of this dark world and against
the spiritual forces of evil in the
heavenly realms.
13Therefore put on the full armor of God,
so that when the day of evil comes, you
may be able to stand your ground, and
after you have done everything, to stand.
14Stand firm then, with the belt of truth
buckled around your waist, with the
breastplate of righteousness in place,
15and with your feet fitted with the
readiness that comes from the gospel of
peace.
16In addition to all this, take up the shield
of faith, with which you can extinguish
all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
17Take the helmet of salvation and the
sword of the Spirit, which is the word of
God.
18And pray in the Spirit on all occasions
with all kinds of prayers and requests.
With this in mind, be alert and always
keep on praying for all the saints.
19Pray also for me, that whenever I open
my mouth, words may be given me so
that I will fearlessly make known the
mystery of the gospel,
20for which I am an ambassador in
chains. Pray that I may declare it
fearlessly, as I should.
21Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful
servant in the Lord, will tell you
everything, so that you also may know
how I am and what I am doing.
22I am sending him to you for this very
purpose, that you may know how we are,
and that he may encourage you.
23Peace to the brothers, and love with
faith from God the Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ.
24Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus
Christ with an undying love.
Philippians
1Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ
Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus
at Philippi, together with the overseers
and deacons:
2Grace and peace to you from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3I thank my God every time I remember
you.
4In all my prayers for all of you, I always
pray with joy
5because of your partnership in the
gospel from the first day until now,
6being confident of this, that he who
began a good work in you will carry it on
to completion until the day of Christ
Jesus.
7It is right for me to feel this way about
all of you, since I have you in my heart;
for whether I am in chains or defending
and confirming the gospel, all of you
share in God's grace with me.
8God can testify how I long for all of you
with the affection of Christ Jesus.
9And this is my prayer: that your love
may abound more and more in
knowledge and depth of insight,
10so that you may be able to discern
what is best and may be pure and
blameless until the day of Christ,
11filled with the fruit of righteousness
that comes through Jesus Christ--to the
glory and praise of God.
12Now I want you to know, brothers, that
what has happened to me has really
served to advance the gospel.
13As a result, it has become clear
throughout the whole palace guard and
to everyone else that I am in chains for
Christ.
14Because of my chains, most of the
brothers in the Lord have been
encouraged to speak the word of God
more courageously and fearlessly.
15It is true that some preach Christ out of
envy and rivalry, but others out of
goodwill.
16The latter do so in love, knowing that I
am put here for the defense of the
gospel.
17The former preach Christ out of selfish
ambition, not sincerely, supposing that
they can stir up trouble for me while I
am in chains.
18But what does it matter? The important
thing is that in every way, whether from
false motives or true, Christ is preached.
And because of this I rejoice.
19Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, for I
know that through your prayers and the
help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
what has happened to me will turn out
for my deliverance.
20I eagerly expect and hope that I will in
no way be ashamed, but will have
sufficient courage so that now as always
Christ will be exalted in my body,
whether by life or by death.
21For to me, to live is Christ and to die is
gain.
22If I am to go on living in the body, this
will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what
shall I choose? I do not know!
23I am torn between the two: I desire to
depart and be with Christ, which is
better by far;
24but it is more necessary for you that I
remain in the body.
25Convinced of this, I know that I will
remain, and I will continue with all of you
for your progress and joy in the faith,
26so that through my being with you
again your joy in Christ Jesus will
overflow on account of me.
27Whatever happens, conduct
yourselves in a manner worthy of the
gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come
and see you or only hear about you in
my absence, I will know that you stand
firm in one spirit, contending as one
man for the faith of the gospel
28without being frightened in any way by
those who oppose you. This is a sign to
them that they will be destroyed, but that
you will be saved--and that by God.
29For it has been granted to you on
behalf of Christ not only to believe on
him, but also to suffer for him,
30since you are going through the same
struggle you saw I had, and now hear
that I still have.
2If you have any encouragement from
being united with Christ, if any comfort
from his love, if any fellowship with the
Spirit, if any tenderness and
compassion,
2then make my joy complete by being
like-minded, having the same love,
being one in spirit and purpose.
3Do nothing out of selfish ambition or
vain conceit, but in humility consider
others better than yourselves.
4Each of you should look not only to
your own interests, but also to the
interests of others.
5Your attitude should be the same as
that of Christ Jesus:
6Who, being in very nature God, did not
consider equality with God something to
be grasped,
7but made himself nothing, taking the
very nature of a servant, being made in
human likeness.
8And being found in appearance as a
man, he humbled himself and became
obedient to death-- even death on a
cross!
9Therefore God exalted him to the
highest place and gave him the name
that is above every name,
10that at the name of Jesus every knee
should bow, in heaven and on earth and
under the earth,
11and every tongue confess that Jesus
Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
Father.
12Therefore, my dear friends, as you
have always obeyed--not only in my
presence, but now much more in my
absence--continue to work out your
salvation with fear and trembling,
13for it is God who works in you to will
and to act according to his good
purpose.
14Do everything without complaining or
arguing,
15so that you may become blameless
and pure, children of God without fault in
a crooked and depraved generation, in
which you shine like stars in the
universe
16as you hold out the word of life--in
order that I may boast on the day of
Christ that I did not run or labor for
nothing.
17But even if I am being poured out like
a drink offering on the sacrifice and
service coming from your faith, I am
glad and rejoice with all of you.
18So you too should be glad and rejoice
with me.
19I hope in the Lord Jesus to send
Timothy to you soon, that I also may be
cheered when I receive news about you.
20I have no one else like him, who takes
a genuine interest in your welfare.
21For everyone looks out for his own
interests, not those of Jesus Christ.
22But you know that Timothy has proved
himself, because as a son with his
father he has served with me in the work
of the gospel.
23I hope, therefore, to send him as soon
as I see how things go with me.
24And I am confident in the Lord that I
myself will come soon.
25But I think it is necessary to send back
to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow
worker and fellow soldier, who is also
your messenger, whom you sent to take
care of my needs.
26For he longs for all of you and is
distressed because you heard he was ill.
27Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But
God had mercy on him, and not on him
only but also on me, to spare me sorrow
upon sorrow.
28Therefore I am all the more eager to
send him, so that when you see him
again you may be glad and I may have
less anxiety.
29Welcome him in the Lord with great joy,
and honor men like him,
30because he almost died for the work of
Christ, risking his life to make up for the
help you could not give me.
3Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the
Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the
same things to you again, and it is a
safeguard for you.
2Watch out for those dogs, those men
who do evil, those mutilators of the flesh.
3For it is we who are the circumcision,
we who worship by the Spirit of God,
who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put
no confidence in the flesh--
4though I myself have reasons for such
confidence.
5If anyone else thinks he has reasons to
put confidence in the flesh, I have more:
circumcised on the eighth day, of the
people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin,
a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the
law, a Pharisee;
6as for zeal, persecuting the church; as
for legalistic righteousness, faultless.
7But whatever was to my profit I now
consider loss for the sake of Christ.
8What is more, I consider everything a
loss compared to the surpassing
greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my
Lord, for whose sake I have lost all
things. I consider them rubbish, that I
may gain Christ
9and be found in him, not having a
righteousness of my own that comes
from the law, but that which is through
faith in Christ--the righteousness that
comes from God and is by faith.
10I want to know Christ and the power of
his resurrection and the fellowship of
sharing in his sufferings, becoming like
him in his death,
11and so, somehow, to attain to the
resurrection from the dead.
12Not that I have already obtained all
this, or have already been made perfect,
but I press on to take hold of that for
which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
13Brothers, I do not consider myself yet
to have taken hold of it. But one thing I
do: Forgetting what is behind and
straining toward what is ahead,
14I press on toward the goal to win the
prize for which God has called me
heavenward in Christ Jesus.
15All of us who are mature should take
such a view of things. And if on some
point you think differently, that too God
will make clear to you.
16Only let us live up to what we have
already attained.
17Join with others in following my
example, brothers, and take note of
those who live according to the pattern
we gave you.
18For, as I have often told you before
and now say again even with tears,
many live as enemies of the cross of
Christ.
19Their destiny is destruction, their god
is their stomach, and their glory is in
their shame. Their mind is on earthly
things.
20But our citizenship is in heaven. And
we eagerly await a Savior from there,
the Lord Jesus Christ,
21who, by the power that enables him to
bring everything under his control, will
transform our lowly bodies so that they
will be like his glorious body.
4Therefore, my brothers, you whom I
love and long for, my joy and crown, that
is how you should stand firm in the Lord,
dear friends!
2I plead with Euodia and I plead with
Syntyche to agree with each other in the
Lord.
3Yes, and I ask you, loyal yokefellow,
help these women who have contended
at my side in the cause of the gospel,
along with Clement and the rest of my
fellow workers, whose names are in the
book of life.
4Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it
again: Rejoice!
5Let your gentleness be evident to all.
The Lord is near.
6Do not be anxious about anything, but
in everything, by prayer and petition,
with thanksgiving, present your requests
to God.
7And the peace of God, which
transcends all understanding, will guard
your hearts and your minds in Christ
Jesus.
8Finally, brothers, whatever is true,
whatever is noble, whatever is right,
whatever is pure, whatever is lovely,
whatever is admirable--if anything is
excellent or praiseworthy--think about
such things.
9Whatever you have learned or received
or heard from me, or seen in me--put it
into practice. And the God of peace will
be with you.
10I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last
you have renewed your concern for me.
Indeed, you have been concerned, but
you had no opportunity to show it.
11I am not saying this because I am in
need, for I have learned to be content
whatever the circumstances.
12I know what it is to be in need, and I
know what it is to have plenty. I have
learned the secret of being content in
any and every situation, whether well
fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or
in want.
13I can do everything through him who
gives me strength.
14Yet it was good of you to share in my
troubles.
15Moreover, as you Philippians know, in
the early days of your acquaintance with
the gospel, when I set out from
Macedonia, not one church shared with
me in the matter of giving and receiving,
except you only;
16for even when I was in Thessalonica,
you sent me aid again and again when I
was in need.
17Not that I am looking for a gift, but I am
looking for what may be credited to your
account.
18I have received full payment and even
more; I am amply supplied, now that I
have received from Epaphroditus the
gifts you sent. They are a fragrant
offering, an acceptable sacrifice,
pleasing to God.
19And my God will meet all your needs
according to his glorious riches in Christ
Jesus.
20To our God and Father be glory for
ever and ever. Amen.
21Greet all the saints in Christ Jesus.
The brothers who are with me send
greetings.
22All the saints send you greetings,
especially those who belong to Caesar's
household.
23The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit. Amen.
Colossians
1Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by
the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
2To the holy and faithful brothers in
Christ at Colosse: Grace and peace to
you from God our Father.
3We always thank God, the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for
you,
4because we have heard of your faith in
Christ Jesus and of the love you have
for all the saints--
5the faith and love that spring from the
hope that is stored up for you in heaven
and that you have already heard about
in the word of truth, the gospel
6that has come to you. All over the world
this gospel is bearing fruit and growing,
just as it has been doing among you
since the day you heard it and
understood God's grace in all its truth.
7You learned it from Epaphras, our dear
fellow servant, who is a faithful minister
of Christ on our behalf,
8and who also told us of your love in the
Spirit.
9For this reason, since the day we heard
about you, we have not stopped praying
for you and asking God to fill you with
the knowledge of his will through all
spiritual wisdom and understanding.
10And we pray this in order that you may
live a life worthy of the Lord and may
please him in every way: bearing fruit in
every good work, growing in the
knowledge of God,
11being strengthened with all power
according to his glorious might so that
you may have great endurance and
patience, and joyfully
12giving thanks to the Father, who has
qualified you to share in the inheritance
of the saints in the kingdom of light.
13For he has rescued us from the
dominion of darkness and brought us
into the kingdom of the Son he loves,
14in whom we have redemption, the
forgiveness of sins.
15He is the image of the invisible God,
the firstborn over all creation.
16For by him all things were created:
things in heaven and on earth, visible
and invisible, whether thrones or powers
or rulers or authorities; all things were
created by him and for him.
17He is before all things, and in him all
things hold together.
18And he is the head of the body, the
church; he is the beginning and the
firstborn from among the dead, so that
in everything he might have the
supremacy.
19For God was pleased to have all his
fullness dwell in him,
20and through him to reconcile to himself
all things, whether things on earth or
things in heaven, by making peace
through his blood, shed on the cross.
21Once you were alienated from God
and were enemies in your minds
because of your evil behavior.
22But now he has reconciled you by
Christ's physical body through death to
present you holy in his sight, without
blemish and free from accusation--
23if you continue in your faith,
established and firm, not moved from
the hope held out in the gospel. This is
the gospel that you heard and that has
been proclaimed to every creature
under heaven, and of which I, Paul,
have become a servant.
24Now I rejoice in what was suffered for
you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still
lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions,
for the sake of his body, which is the
church.
25I have become its servant by the
commission God gave me to present to
you the word of God in its fullness--
26the mystery that has been kept hidden
for ages and generations, but is now
disclosed to the saints.
27To them God has chosen to make
known among the Gentiles the glorious
riches of this mystery, which is Christ in
you, the hope of glory.
28We proclaim him, admonishing and
teaching everyone with all wisdom, so
that we may present everyone perfect in
Christ.
29To this end I labor, struggling with all
his energy, which so powerfully works in
me.
2I want you to know how much I am
struggling for you and for those at
Laodicea, and for all who have not met
me personally.
2My purpose is that they may be
encouraged in heart and united in love,
so that they may have the full riches of
complete understanding, in order that
they may know the mystery of God,
namely, Christ,
3in whom are hidden all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge.
4I tell you this so that no one may
deceive you by fine-sounding arguments.
5For though I am absent from you in
body, I am present with you in spirit and
delight to see how orderly you are and
how firm your faith in Christ is.
6So then, just as you received Christ
Jesus as Lord, continue to live in him,
7rooted and built up in him, strengthened
in the faith as you were taught, and
overflowing with thankfulness.
8See to it that no one takes you captive
through hollow and deceptive
philosophy, which depends on human
tradition and the basic principles of this
world rather than on Christ.
9For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity
lives in bodily form,
10and you have been given fullness in
Christ, who is the head over every
power and authority.
11In him you were also circumcised, in
the putting off of the sinful nature, not
with a circumcision done by the hands
of men but with the circumcision done
by Christ,
12having been buried with him in
baptism and raised with him through
your faith in the power of God, who
raised him from the dead.
13When you were dead in your sins and
in the uncircumcision of your sinful
nature, God made you alive with Christ.
He forgave us all our sins,
14having canceled the written code, with
its regulations, that was against us and
that stood opposed to us; he took it
away, nailing it to the cross.
15And having disarmed the powers and
authorities, he made a public spectacle
of them, triumphing over them by the
cross.
16Therefore do not let anyone judge you
by what you eat or drink, or with regard
to a religious festival, a New Moon
celebration or a Sabbath day.
17These are a shadow of the things that
were to come; the reality, however, is
found in Christ.
18Do not let anyone who delights in false
humility and the worship of angels
disqualify you for the prize. Such a
person goes into great detail about what
he has seen, and his unspiritual mind
puffs him up with idle notions.
19He has lost connection with the Head,
from whom the whole body, supported
and held together by its ligaments and
sinews, grows as God causes it to grow.
20Since you died with Christ to the basic
principles of this world, why, as though
you still belonged to it, do you submit to
its rules:
21"Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not
touch!"?
22These are all destined to perish with
use, because they are based on human
commands and teachings.
23Such regulations indeed have an
appearance of wisdom, with their selfimposed
worship, their false humility
and their harsh treatment of the body,
but they lack any value in restraining
sensual indulgence.
3Since, then, you have been raised
with Christ, set your hearts on things
above, where Christ is seated at the
right hand of God.
2Set your minds on things above, not on
earthly things.
3For you died, and your life is now
hidden with Christ in God.
4When Christ, who is your life, appears,
then you also will appear with him in
glory.
5Put to death, therefore, whatever
belongs to your earthly nature: sexual
immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires
and greed, which is idolatry.
6Because of these, the wrath of God is
coming.
7You used to walk in these ways, in the
life you once lived.
8But now you must rid yourselves of all
such things as these: anger, rage,
malice, slander, and filthy language from
your lips.
9Do not lie to each other, since you have
taken off your old self with its practices
10and have put on the new self, which is
being renewed in knowledge in the
image of its Creator.
11Here there is no Greek or Jew,
circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian,
Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all,
and is in all.
12Therefore, as God's chosen people,
holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves
with compassion, kindness, humility,
gentleness and patience.
13Bear with each other and forgive
whatever grievances you may have
against one another. Forgive as the
Lord forgave you.
14And over all these virtues put on love,
which binds them all together in perfect
unity.
15Let the peace of Christ rule in your
hearts, since as members of one body
you were called to peace. And be
thankful.
16Let the word of Christ dwell in you
richly as you teach and admonish one
another with all wisdom, and as you sing
psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with
gratitude in your hearts to God.
17And whatever you do, whether in word
or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord
Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father
through him.
18Wives, submit to your husbands, as is
fitting in the Lord.
19Husbands, love your wives and do not
be harsh with them.
20Children, obey your parents in
everything, for this pleases the Lord.
21Fathers, do not embitter your children,
or they will become discouraged.
22Slaves, obey your earthly masters in
everything; and do it, not only when their
eye is on you and to win their favor, but
with sincerity of heart and reverence for
the Lord.
23Whatever you do, work at it with all
your heart, as working for the Lord, not
for men,
24since you know that you will receive an
inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It
is the Lord Christ you are serving.
25Anyone who does wrong will be repaid
for his wrong, and there is no favoritism.
4Masters, provide your slaves with
what is right and fair, because you know
that you also have a Master in heaven.
2Devote yourselves to prayer, being
watchful and thankful.
3And pray for us, too, that God may
open a door for our message, so that we
may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for
which I am in chains.
4Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I
should.
5Be wise in the way you act toward
outsiders; make the most of every
opportunity.
6Let your conversation be always full of
grace, seasoned with salt, so that you
may know how to answer everyone.
7Tychicus will tell you all the news about
me. He is a dear brother, a faithful
minister and fellow servant in the Lord.
8I am sending him to you for the express
purpose that you may know about our
circumstances and that he may
encourage your hearts.
9He is coming with Onesimus, our
faithful and dear brother, who is one of
you. They will tell you everything that is
happening here.
10My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends
you his greetings, as does Mark, the
cousin of Barnabas. (You have received
instructions about him; if he comes to
you, welcome him.)
11Jesus, who is called Justus, also
sends greetings. These are the only
Jews among my fellow workers for the
kingdom of God, and they have proved
a comfort to me.
12Epaphras, who is one of you and a
servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings.
He is always wrestling in prayer for you,
that you may stand firm in all the will of
God, mature and fully assured.
13I vouch for him that he is working hard
for you and for those at Laodicea and
Hierapolis.
14Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and
Demas send greetings.
15Give my greetings to the brothers at
Laodicea, and to Nympha and the
church in her house.
16After this letter has been read to you,
see that it is also read in the church of
the Laodiceans and that you in turn read
the letter from Laodicea.
17Tell Archippus: "See to it that you
complete the work you have received in
the Lord."
18I, Paul, write this greeting in my own
hand. Remember my chains. Grace be
with you.
1st Thessalonians
1Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the
church of the Thessalonians in God the
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace
and peace to you.
2We always thank God for all of you,
mentioning you in our prayers.
3We continually remember before our
God and Father your work produced by
faith, your labor prompted by love, and
your endurance inspired by hope in our
Lord Jesus Christ.
4For we know, brothers loved by God,
that he has chosen you,
5because our gospel came to you not
simply with words, but also with power,
with the Holy Spirit and with deep
conviction. You know how we lived
among you for your sake.
6You became imitators of us and of the
Lord; in spite of severe suffering, you
welcomed the message with the joy
given by the Holy Spirit.
7And so you became a model to all the
believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
8The Lord's message rang out from you
not only in Macedonia and Achaia--your
faith in God has become known
everywhere. Therefore we do not need
to say anything about it,
9for they themselves report what kind of
reception you gave us. They tell how
you turned to God from idols to serve
the living and true God,
10and to wait for his Son from heaven,
whom he raised from the dead--Jesus,
who rescues us from the coming wrath.
2You know, brothers, that our visit to
you was not a failure.
2We had previously suffered and been
insulted in Philippi, as you know, but
with the help of our God we dared to tell
you his gospel in spite of strong
opposition.
3For the appeal we make does not
spring from error or impure motives, nor
are we trying to trick you.
4On the contrary, we speak as men
approved by God to be entrusted with
the gospel. We are not trying to please
men but God, who tests our hearts.
5You know we never used flattery, nor
did we put on a mask to cover up greed-
-God is our witness.
6We were not looking for praise from
men, not from you or anyone else.
7As apostles of Christ we could have
been a burden to you, but we were
gentle among you, like a mother caring
for her little children.
8We loved you so much that we were
delighted to share with you not only the
gospel of God but our lives as well,
because you had become so dear to us.
9Surely you remember, brothers, our toil
and hardship; we worked night and day
in order not to be a burden to anyone
while we preached the gospel of God to
you.
10You are witnesses, and so is God, of
how holy, righteous and blameless we
were among you who believed.
11For you know that we dealt with each
of you as a father deals with his own
children,
12encouraging, comforting and urging
you to live lives worthy of God, who calls
you into his kingdom and glory.
13And we also thank God continually
because, when you received the word of
God, which you heard from us, you
accepted it not as the word of men, but
as it actually is, the word of God, which
is at work in you who believe.
14For you, brothers, became imitators of
God's churches in Judea, which are in
Christ Jesus: You suffered from your
own countrymen the same things those
churches suffered from the Jews,
15who killed the Lord Jesus and the
prophets and also drove us out. They
displease God and are hostile to all men
16in their effort to keep us from speaking
to the Gentiles so that they may be
saved. In this way they always heap up
their sins to the limit. The wrath of God
has come upon them at last.
17But, brothers, when we were torn
away from you for a short time (in
person, not in thought), out of our
intense longing we made every effort to
see you.
18For we wanted to come to you--
certainly I, Paul, did, again and again--
but Satan stopped us.
19For what is our hope, our joy, or the
crown in which we will glory in the
presence of our Lord Jesus when he
comes? Is it not you?
20Indeed, you are our glory and joy.
3So when we could stand it no longer,
we thought it best to be left by ourselves
in Athens.
2We sent Timothy, who is our brother
and God's fellow worker in spreading
the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and
encourage you in your faith,
3so that no one would be unsettled by
these trials. You know quite well that we
were destined for them.
4In fact, when we were with you, we kept
telling you that we would be persecuted.
And it turned out that way, as you well
know.
5For this reason, when I could stand it
no longer, I sent to find out about your
faith. I was afraid that in some way the
tempter might have tempted you and
our efforts might have been useless.
6But Timothy has just now come to us
from you and has brought good news
about your faith and love. He has told us
that you always have pleasant
memories of us and that you long to see
us, just as we also long to see you.
7Therefore, brothers, in all our distress
and persecution we were encouraged
about you because of your faith.
8For now we really live, since you are
standing firm in the Lord.
9How can we thank God enough for you
in return for all the joy we have in the
presence of our God because of you?
10Night and day we pray most earnestly
that we may see you again and supply
what is lacking in your faith.
11Now may our God and Father himself
and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us
to come to you.
12May the Lord make your love increase
and overflow for each other and for
everyone else, just as ours does for you.
13May he strengthen your hearts so that
you will be blameless and holy in the
presence of our God and Father when
our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy
ones.
4Finally, brothers, we instructed you
how to live in order to please God, as in
fact you are living. Now we ask you and
urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this
more and more.
2For you know what instructions we
gave you by the authority of the Lord
Jesus.
3It is God's will that you should be
sanctified: that you should avoid sexual
immorality;
4that each of you should learn to control
his own body in a way that is holy and
honorable,
5not in passionate lust like the heathen,
who do not know God;
6and that in this matter no one should
wrong his brother or take advantage of
him. The Lord will punish men for all
such sins, as we have already told you
and warned you.
7For God did not call us to be impure,
but to live a holy life.
8Therefore, he who rejects this
instruction does not reject man but God,
who gives you his Holy Spirit.
9Now about brotherly love we do not
need to write to you, for you yourselves
have been taught by God to love each
other.
10And in fact, you do love all the
brothers throughout Macedonia. Yet we
urge you, brothers, to do so more and
more.
11Make it your ambition to lead a quiet
life, to mind your own business and to
work with your hands, just as we told
you,
12so that your daily life may win the
respect of outsiders and so that you will
not be dependent on anybody.
13Brothers, we do not want you to be
ignorant about those who fall asleep, or
to grieve like the rest of men, who have
no hope.
14We believe that Jesus died and rose
again and so we believe that God will
bring with Jesus those who have fallen
asleep in him.
15According to the Lord's own word, we
tell you that we who are still alive, who
are left till the coming of the Lord, will
certainly not precede those who have
fallen asleep.
16For the Lord himself will come down
from heaven, with a loud command, with
the voice of the archangel and with the
trumpet call of God, and the dead in
Christ will rise first.
17After that, we who are still alive and
are left will be caught up together with
them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
the air. And so we will be with the Lord
forever.
18Therefore encourage each other with
these words.
5Now, brothers, about times and dates
we do not need to write to you,
2for you know very well that the day of
the Lord will come like a thief in the
night.
3While people are saying, "Peace and
safety," destruction will come on them
suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant
woman, and they will not escape.
4But you, brothers, are not in darkness
so that this day should surprise you like
a thief.
5You are all sons of the light and sons of
the day. We do not belong to the night
or to the darkness.
6So then, let us not be like others, who
are asleep, but let us be alert and selfcontrolled.
7For those who sleep, sleep at night,
and those who get drunk, get drunk at
night.
8But since we belong to the day, let us
be self-controlled, putting on faith and
love as a breastplate, and the hope of
salvation as a helmet.
9For God did not appoint us to suffer
wrath but to receive salvation through
our Lord Jesus Christ.
10He died for us so that, whether we are
awake or asleep, we may live together
with him.
11Therefore encourage one another and
build each other up, just as in fact you
are doing.
12Now we ask you, brothers, to respect
those who work hard among you, who
are over you in the Lord and who
admonish you.
13Hold them in the highest regard in love
because of their work. Live in peace
with each other.
14And we urge you, brothers, warn those
who are idle, encourage the timid, help
the weak, be patient with everyone.
15Make sure that nobody pays back
wrong for wrong, but always try to be
kind to each other and to everyone else.
16Be joyful always;
17pray continually;
18give thanks in all circumstances, for
this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
19Do not put out the Spirit's fire;
20do not treat prophecies with contempt.
21Test everything. Hold on to the good.
22Avoid every kind of evil.
23May God himself, the God of peace,
sanctify you through and through. May
your whole spirit, soul and body be kept
blameless at the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ.
24The one who calls you is faithful and
he will do it.
25Brothers, pray for us.
26Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
27I charge you before the Lord to have
this letter read to all the brothers.
28The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you.
2nd Thessalonians
1Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the
church of the Thessalonians in God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
2Grace and peace to you from God the
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3We ought always to thank God for you,
brothers, and rightly so, because your
faith is growing more and more, and the
love every one of you has for each other
is increasing.
4Therefore, among God's churches we
boast about your perseverance and faith
in all the persecutions and trials you are
enduring.
5All this is evidence that God's judgment
is right, and as a result you will be
counted worthy of the kingdom of God,
for which you are suffering.
6God is just: He will pay back trouble to
those who trouble you
7and give relief to you who are troubled,
and to us as well. This will happen when
the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven
in blazing fire with his powerful angels.
8He will punish those who do not know
God and do not obey the gospel of our
Lord Jesus.
9They will be punished with everlasting
destruction and shut out from the
presence of the Lord and from the
majesty of his power
10on the day he comes to be glorified in
his holy people and to be marveled at
among all those who have believed.
This includes you, because you believed
our testimony to you.
11With this in mind, we constantly pray
for you, that our God may count you
worthy of his calling, and that by his
power he may fulfill every good purpose
of yours and every act prompted by your
faith.
12We pray this so that the name of our
Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and
you in him, according to the grace of our
God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2Concerning the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ and our being gathered to
him, we ask you, brothers,
2not to become easily unsettled or
alarmed by some prophecy, report or
letter supposed to have come from us,
saying that the day of the Lord has
already come.
3Don't let anyone deceive you in any
way, for that day will not come until the
rebellion occurs and the man of
lawlessness is revealed, the man
doomed to destruction.
4He will oppose and will exalt himself
over everything that is called God or is
worshiped, so that he sets himself up in
God's temple, proclaiming himself to be
God.
5Don't you remember that when I was
with you I used to tell you these things?
6And now you know what is holding him
back, so that he may be revealed at the
proper time.
7For the secret power of lawlessness is
already at work; but the one who now
holds it back will continue to do so till he
is taken out of the way.
8And then the lawless one will be
revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will
overthrow with the breath of his mouth
and destroy by the splendor of his
coming.
9The coming of the lawless one will be in
accordance with the work of Satan
displayed in all kinds of counterfeit
miracles, signs and wonders,
10and in every sort of evil that deceives
those who are perishing. They perish
because they refused to love the truth
and so be saved.
11For this reason God sends them a
powerful delusion so that they will
believe the lie
12and so that all will be condemned who
have not believed the truth but have
delighted in wickedness.
13But we ought always to thank God for
you, brothers loved by the Lord,
because from the beginning God chose
you to be saved through the sanctifying
work of the Spirit and through belief in
the truth.
14He called you to this through our
gospel, that you might share in the glory
of our Lord Jesus Christ.
15So then, brothers, stand firm and hold
to the teachings we passed on to you,
whether by word of mouth or by letter.
16May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and
God our Father, who loved us and by
his grace gave us eternal
encouragement and good hope,
17encourage your hearts and strengthen
you in every good deed and word.
3Finally, brothers, pray for us that the
message of the Lord may spread rapidly
and be honored, just as it was with you.
2And pray that we may be delivered
from wicked and evil men, for not
everyone has faith.
3But the Lord is faithful, and he will
strengthen and protect you from the evil
one.
4We have confidence in the Lord that
you are doing and will continue to do the
things we command.
5May the Lord direct your hearts into
God's love and Christ's perseverance.
6In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
we command you, brothers, to keep
away from every brother who is idle and
does not live according to the teaching
you received from us.
7For you yourselves know how you
ought to follow our example. We were
not idle when we were with you,
8nor did we eat anyone's food without
paying for it. On the contrary, we worked
night and day, laboring and toiling so
that we would not be a burden to any of
you.
9We did this, not because we do not
have the right to such help, but in order
to make ourselves a model for you to
follow.
10For even when we were with you, we
gave you this rule: "If a man will not
work, he shall not eat."
11We hear that some among you are idle.
They are not busy; they are busybodies.
12Such people we command and urge in
the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and
earn the bread they eat.
13And as for you, brothers, never tire of
doing what is right.
14If anyone does not obey our instruction
in this letter, take special note of him.
Do not associate with him, in order that
he may feel ashamed.
15Yet do not regard him as an enemy,
but warn him as a brother.
16Now may the Lord of peace himself
give you peace at all times and in every
way. The Lord be with all of you.
17I, Paul, write this greeting in my own
hand, which is the distinguishing mark in
all my letters. This is how I write.
18The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you all.
1st Timothy
1Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by
the command of God our Savior and of
Christ Jesus our hope,
2To Timothy my true son in the faith:
Grace, mercy and peace from God the
Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
3As I urged you when I went into
Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so
that you may command certain men not
to teach false doctrines any longer
4nor to devote themselves to myths and
endless genealogies. These promote
controversies rather than God's work--
which is by faith.
5The goal of this command is love,
which comes from a pure heart and a
good conscience and a sincere faith.
6Some have wandered away from these
and turned to meaningless talk.
7They want to be teachers of the law,
but they do not know what they are
talking about or what they so confidently
affirm.
8We know that the law is good if one
uses it properly.
9We also know that law is made not for
the righteous but for lawbreakers and
rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the
unholy and irreligious; for those who kill
their fathers or mothers, for murderers,
10for adulterers and perverts, for slave
traders and liars and perjurers--and for
whatever else is contrary to the sound
doctrine
11that conforms to the glorious gospel of
the blessed God, which he entrusted to
me.
12I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has
given me strength, that he considered
me faithful, appointing me to his service.
13Even though I was once a blasphemer
and a persecutor and a violent man, I
was shown mercy because I acted in
ignorance and unbelief.
14The grace of our Lord was poured out
on me abundantly, along with the faith
and love that are in Christ Jesus.
15Here is a trustworthy saying that
deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus
came into the world to save sinners--of
whom I am the worst.
16But for that very reason I was shown
mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners,
Christ Jesus might display his unlimited
patience as an example for those who
would believe on him and receive
eternal life.
17Now to the King eternal, immortal,
invisible, the only God, be honor and
glory for ever and ever. Amen.
18Timothy, my son, I give you this
instruction in keeping with the
prophecies once made about you, so
that by following them you may fight the
good fight,
19holding on to faith and a good
conscience. Some have rejected these
and so have shipwrecked their faith.
20Among them are Hymenaeus and
Alexander, whom I have handed over to
Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.
2I urge, then, first of all, that requests,
prayers, intercession and thanksgiving
be made for everyone--
2for kings and all those in authority, that
we may live peaceful and quiet lives in
all godliness and holiness.
3This is good, and pleases God our
Savior,
4who wants all men to be saved and to
come to a knowledge of the truth.
5For there is one God and one mediator
between God and men, the man Christ
Jesus,
6who gave himself as a ransom for all
men--the testimony given in its proper
time.
7And for this purpose I was appointed a
herald and an apostle--I am telling the
truth, I am not lying--and a teacher of
the true faith to the Gentiles.
8I want men everywhere to lift up holy
hands in prayer, without anger or
disputing.
9I also want women to dress modestly,
with decency and propriety, not with
braided hair or gold or pearls or
expensive clothes,
10but with good deeds, appropriate for
women who profess to worship God.
11A woman should learn in quietness
and full submission.
12I do not permit a woman to teach or to
have authority over a man; she must be
silent.
13For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
14And Adam was not the one deceived;
it was the woman who was deceived
and became a sinner.
15But women will be saved through
childbearing--if they continue in faith,
love and holiness with propriety.
3Here is a trustworthy saying: If
anyone sets his heart on being an
overseer, he desires a noble task.
2Now the overseer must be above
reproach, the husband of but one wife,
temperate, self-controlled, respectable,
hospitable, able to teach,
3not given to drunkenness, not violent
but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover
of money.
4He must manage his own family well
and see that his children obey him with
proper respect.
5(If anyone does not know how to
manage his own family, how can he
take care of God's church?)
6He must not be a recent convert, or he
may become conceited and fall under
the same judgment as the devil.
7He must also have a good reputation
with outsiders, so that he will not fall into
disgrace and into the devil's trap.
8Deacons, likewise, are to be men
worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging
in much wine, and not pursuing
dishonest gain.
9They must keep hold of the deep truths
of the faith with a clear conscience.
10They must first be tested; and then if
there is nothing against them, let them
serve as deacons.
11In the same way, their wives are to be
women worthy of respect, not malicious
talkers but temperate and trustworthy in
everything.
12A deacon must be the husband of but
one wife and must manage his children
and his household well.
13Those who have served well gain an
excellent standing and great assurance
in their faith in Christ Jesus.
14Although I hope to come to you soon, I
am writing you these instructions so that,
15if I am delayed, you will know how
people ought to conduct themselves in
God's household, which is the church of
the living God, the pillar and foundation
of the truth.
16Beyond all question, the mystery of
godliness is great: He appeared in a
body, was vindicated by the Spirit, was
seen by angels, was preached among
the nations, was believed on in the
world, was taken up in glory.
4The Spirit clearly says that in later
times some will abandon the faith and
follow deceiving spirits and things taught
by demons.
2Such teachings come through
hypocritical liars, whose consciences
have been seared as with a hot iron.
3They forbid people to marry and order
them to abstain from certain foods,
which God created to be received with
thanksgiving by those who believe and
who know the truth.
4For everything God created is good,
and nothing is to be rejected if it is
received with thanksgiving,
5because it is consecrated by the word
of God and prayer.
6If you point these things out to the
brothers, you will be a good minister of
Christ Jesus, brought up in the truths of
the faith and of the good teaching that
you have followed.
7Have nothing to do with godless myths
and old wives' tales; rather, train
yourself to be godly.
8For physical training is of some value,
but godliness has value for all things,
holding promise for both the present life
and the life to come.
9This is a trustworthy saying that
deserves full acceptance
10(and for this we labor and strive), that
we have put our hope in the living God,
who is the Savior of all men, and
especially of those who believe.
11Command and teach these things.
12Don't let anyone look down on you
because you are young, but set an
example for the believers in speech, in
life, in love, in faith and in purity.
13Until I come, devote yourself to the
public reading of Scripture, to preaching
and to teaching.
14Do not neglect your gift, which was
given you through a prophetic message
when the body of elders laid their hands
on you.
15Be diligent in these matters; give
yourself wholly to them, so that
everyone may see your progress.
16Watch your life and doctrine closely.
Persevere in them, because if you do,
you will save both yourself and your
hearers.
5Do not rebuke an older man harshly,
but exhort him as if he were your father.
Treat younger men as brothers,
2older women as mothers, and younger
women as sisters, with absolute purity.
3Give proper recognition to those
widows who are really in need.
4But if a widow has children or
grandchildren, these should learn first of
all to put their religion into practice by
caring for their own family and so
repaying their parents and grandparents,
for this is pleasing to God.
5The widow who is really in need and
left all alone puts her hope in God and
continues night and day to pray and to
ask God for help.
6But the widow who lives for pleasure is
dead even while she lives.
7Give the people these instructions, too,
so that no one may be open to blame.
8If anyone does not provide for his
relatives, and especially for his
immediate family, he has denied the
faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
9No widow may be put on the list of
widows unless she is over sixty, has
been faithful to her husband,
10and is well known for her good deeds,
such as bringing up children, showing
hospitality, washing the feet of the saints,
helping those in trouble and devoting
herself to all kinds of good deeds.
11As for younger widows, do not put
them on such a list. For when their
sensual desires overcome their
dedication to Christ, they want to marry.
12Thus they bring judgment on
themselves, because they have broken
their first pledge.
13Besides, they get into the habit of
being idle and going about from house
to house. And not only do they become
idlers, but also gossips and busybodies,
saying things they ought not to.
14So I counsel younger widows to marry,
to have children, to manage their homes
and to give the enemy no opportunity for
slander.
15Some have in fact already turned
away to follow Satan.
16If any woman who is a believer has
widows in her family, she should help
them and not let the church be
burdened with them, so that the church
can help those widows who are really in
need.
17The elders who direct the affairs of the
church well are worthy of double honor,
especially those whose work is
preaching and teaching.
18For the Scripture says, "Do not muzzle
the ox while it is treading out the grain,"
and "The worker deserves his wages."
19Do not entertain an accusation against
an elder unless it is brought by two or
three witnesses.
20Those who sin are to be rebuked
publicly, so that the others may take
warning.
21I charge you, in the sight of God and
Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to
keep these instructions without partiality,
and to do nothing out of favoritism.
22Do not be hasty in the laying on of
hands, and do not share in the sins of
others. Keep yourself pure.
23Stop drinking only water, and use a
little wine because of your stomach and
your frequent illnesses.
24The sins of some men are obvious,
reaching the place of judgment ahead of
them; the sins of others trail behind
them.
25In the same way, good deeds are
obvious, and even those that are not
cannot be hidden.
6All who are under the yoke of slavery
should consider their masters worthy of
full respect, so that God's name and our
teaching may not be slandered.
2Those who have believing masters are
not to show less respect for them
because they are brothers. Instead, they
are to serve them even better, because
those who benefit from their service are
believers, and dear to them. These are
the things you are to teach and urge on
them.
3If anyone teaches false doctrines and
does not agree to the sound instruction
of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly
teaching,
4he is conceited and understands
nothing. He has an unhealthy interest in
controversies and quarrels about words
that result in envy, strife, malicious talk,
evil suspicions
5and constant friction between men of
corrupt mind, who have been robbed of
the truth and who think that godliness is
a means to financial gain.
6But godliness with contentment is great
gain.
7For we brought nothing into the world,
and we can take nothing out of it.
8But if we have food and clothing, we
will be content with that.
9People who want to get rich fall into
temptation and a trap and into many
foolish and harmful desires that plunge
men into ruin and destruction.
10For the love of money is a root of all
kinds of evil. Some people, eager for
money, have wandered from the faith
and pierced themselves with many
griefs.
11But you, man of God, flee from all this,
and pursue righteousness, godliness,
faith, love, endurance and gentleness.
12Fight the good fight of the faith. Take
hold of the eternal life to which you were
called when you made your good
confession in the presence of many
witnesses.
13In the sight of God, who gives life to
everything, and of Christ Jesus, who
while testifying before Pontius Pilate
made the good confession, I charge you
14to keep this command without spot or
blame until the appearing of our Lord
Jesus Christ,
15which God will bring about in his own
time--God, the blessed and only Ruler,
the King of kings and Lord of lords,
16who alone is immortal and who lives in
unapproachable light, whom no one has
seen or can see. To him be honor and
might forever. Amen.
17Command those who are rich in this
present world not to be arrogant nor to
put their hope in wealth, which is so
uncertain, but to put their hope in God,
who richly provides us with everything
for our enjoyment.
18Command them to do good, to be rich
in good deeds, and to be generous and
willing to share.
19In this way they will lay up treasure for
themselves as a firm foundation for the
coming age, so that they may take hold
of the life that is truly life.
20Timothy, guard what has been
entrusted to your care. Turn away from
godless chatter and the opposing ideas
of what is falsely called knowledge,
21which some have professed and in so
doing have wandered from the faith.
Grace be with you.

2nd Timothy
1Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by
the will of God, according to the promise
of life that is in Christ Jesus,
2To Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy
and peace from God the Father and
Christ Jesus our Lord.
3I thank God, whom I serve, as my
forefathers did, with a clear conscience,
as night and day I constantly remember
you in my prayers.
4Recalling your tears, I long to see you,
so that I may be filled with joy.
5I have been reminded of your sincere
faith, which first lived in your
grandmother Lois and in your mother
Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives
in you also.
6For this reason I remind you to fan into
flame the gift of God, which is in you
through the laying on of my hands.
7For God did not give us a spirit of
timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and
of self-discipline.
8So do not be ashamed to testify about
our Lord, or ashamed of me his prisoner.
But join with me in suffering for the
gospel, by the power of God,
9who has saved us and called us to a
holy life--not because of anything we
have done but because of his own
purpose and grace. This grace was
given us in Christ Jesus before the
beginning of time,
10but it has now been revealed through
the appearing of our Savior, Christ
Jesus, who has destroyed death and
has brought life and immortality to light
through the gospel.
11And of this gospel I was appointed a
herald and an apostle and a teacher.
12That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet
I am not ashamed, because I know
whom I have believed, and am
convinced that he is able to guard what I
have entrusted to him for that day.
13What you heard from me, keep as the
pattern of sound teaching, with faith and
love in Christ Jesus.
14Guard the good deposit that was
entrusted to you--guard it with the help
of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.
15You know that everyone in the
province of Asia has deserted me,
including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
16May the Lord show mercy to the
household of Onesiphorus, because he
often refreshed me and was not
ashamed of my chains.
17On the contrary, when he was in
Rome, he searched hard for me until he
found me.
18May the Lord grant that he will find
mercy from the Lord on that day! You
know very well in how many ways he
helped me in Ephesus.
2You then, my son, be strong in the
grace that is in Christ Jesus.
2And the things you have heard me say
in the presence of many witnesses
entrust to reliable men who will also be
qualified to teach others.
3Endure hardship with us like a good
soldier of Christ Jesus.
4No one serving as a soldier gets
involved in civilian affairs--he wants to
please his commanding officer.
5Similarly, if anyone competes as an
athlete, he does not receive the victor's
crown unless he competes according to
the rules.
6The hardworking farmer should be the
first to receive a share of the crops.
7Reflect on what I am saying, for the
Lord will give you insight into all this.
8Remember Jesus Christ, raised from
the dead, descended from David. This is
my gospel,
9for which I am suffering even to the
point of being chained like a criminal.
But God's word is not chained.
10Therefore I endure everything for the
sake of the elect, that they too may
obtain the salvation that is in Christ
Jesus, with eternal glory.
11Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died
with him, we will also live with him;
12if we endure, we will also reign with
him. If we disown him, he will also
disown us;
13if we are faithless, he will remain
faithful, for he cannot disown himself.
14Keep reminding them of these things.
Warn them before God against
quarreling about words; it is of no value,
and only ruins those who listen.
15Do your best to present yourself to
God as one approved, a workman who
does not need to be ashamed and who
correctly handles the word of truth.
16Avoid godless chatter, because those
who indulge in it will become more and
more ungodly.
17Their teaching will spread like
gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus
and Philetus,
18who have wandered away from the
truth. They say that the resurrection has
already taken place, and they destroy
the faith of some.
19Nevertheless, God's solid foundation
stands firm, sealed with this inscription:
"The Lord knows those who are his,"
and, "Everyone who confesses the
name of the Lord must turn away from
wickedness."
20In a large house there are articles not
only of gold and silver, but also of wood
and clay; some are for noble purposes
and some for ignoble.
21If a man cleanses himself from the
latter, he will be an instrument for noble
purposes, made holy, useful to the
Master and prepared to do any good
work.
22Flee the evil desires of youth, and
pursue righteousness, faith, love and
peace, along with those who call on the
Lord out of a pure heart.
23Don't have anything to do with foolish
and stupid arguments, because you
know they produce quarrels.
24And the Lord's servant must not
quarrel; instead, he must be kind to
everyone, able to teach, not resentful.
25Those who oppose him he must gently
instruct, in the hope that God will grant
them repentance leading them to a
knowledge of the truth,
26and that they will come to their senses
and escape from the trap of the devil,
who has taken them captive to do his
will.
3But mark this: There will be terrible
times in the last days.
2People will be lovers of themselves,
lovers of money, boastful, proud,
abusive, disobedient to their parents,
ungrateful, unholy,
3without love, unforgiving, slanderous,
without self-control, brutal, not lovers of
the good,
4treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of
pleasure rather than lovers of God--
5having a form of godliness but denying
its power. Have nothing to do with them.
6They are the kind who worm their way
into homes and gain control over weakwilled
women, who are loaded down
with sins and are swayed by all kinds of
evil desires,
7always learning but never able to
acknowledge the truth.
8Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed
Moses, so also these men oppose the
truth--men of depraved minds, who, as
far as the faith is concerned, are
rejected.
9But they will not get very far because,
as in the case of those men, their folly
will be clear to everyone.
10You, however, know all about my
teaching, my way of life, my purpose,
faith, patience, love, endurance,
11persecutions, sufferings--what kinds of
things happened to me in Antioch,
Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I
endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from
all of them.
12In fact, everyone who wants to live a
godly life in Christ Jesus will be
persecuted,
13while evil men and impostors will go
from bad to worse, deceiving and being
deceived.
14But as for you, continue in what you
have learned and have become
convinced of, because you know those
from whom you learned it,
15and how from infancy you have known
the holy Scriptures, which are able to
make you wise for salvation through
faith in Christ Jesus.
16All Scripture is God-breathed and is
useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting
and training in righteousness,
17so that the man of God may be
thoroughly equipped for every good
work.
4In the presence of God and of Christ
Jesus, who will judge the living and the
dead, and in view of his appearing and
his kingdom, I give you this charge:
2Preach the Word; be prepared in
season and out of season; correct,
rebuke and encourage--with great
patience and careful instruction.
3For the time will come when men will
not put up with sound doctrine. Instead,
to suit their own desires, they will gather
around them a great number of teachers
to say what their itching ears want to
hear.
4They will turn their ears away from the
truth and turn aside to myths.
5But you, keep your head in all
situations, endure hardship, do the work
of an evangelist, discharge all the duties
of your ministry.
6For I am already being poured out like
a drink offering, and the time has come
for my departure.
7I have fought the good fight, I have
finished the race, I have kept the faith.
8Now there is in store for me the crown
of righteousness, which the Lord, the
righteous Judge, will award to me on
that day--and not only to me, but also to
all who have longed for his appearing.
9Do your best to come to me quickly,
10for Demas, because he loved this
world, has deserted me and has gone to
Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to
Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.
11Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and
bring him with you, because he is
helpful to me in my ministry.
12I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
13When you come, bring the cloak that I
left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls,
especially the parchments.
14Alexander the metalworker did me a
great deal of harm. The Lord will repay
him for what he has done.
15You too should be on your guard
against him, because he strongly
opposed our message.
16At my first defense, no one came to
my support, but everyone deserted me.
May it not be held against them.
17But the Lord stood at my side and
gave me strength, so that through me
the message might be fully proclaimed
and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I
was delivered from the lion's mouth.
18The Lord will rescue me from every
evil attack and will bring me safely to his
heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for
ever and ever. Amen.
19Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the
household of Onesiphorus.
20Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left
Trophimus sick in Miletus.
21Do your best to get here before winter.
Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens,
Linus, Claudia and all the brothers.
22The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be
with you.
Titus
1Paul, a servant of God and an
apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of
God's elect and the knowledge of the
truth that leads to godliness--
2a faith and knowledge resting on the
hope of eternal life, which God, who
does not lie, promised before the
beginning of time,
3and at his appointed season he brought
his word to light through the preaching
entrusted to me by the command of God
our Savior,
4To Titus, my true son in our common
faith: Grace and peace from God the
Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
5The reason I left you in Crete was that
you might straighten out what was left
unfinished and appoint elders in every
town, as I directed you.
6An elder must be blameless, the
husband of but one wife, a man whose
children believe and are not open to the
charge of being wild and disobedient.
7Since an overseer is entrusted with
God's work, he must be blameless--not
overbearing, not quick-tempered, not
given to drunkenness, not violent, not
pursuing dishonest gain.
8Rather he must be hospitable, one who
loves what is good, who is selfcontrolled,
upright, holy and disciplined.
9He must hold firmly to the trustworthy
message as it has been taught, so that
he can encourage others by sound
doctrine and refute those who oppose it.
10For there are many rebellious people,
mere talkers and deceivers, especially
those of the circumcision group.
11They must be silenced, because they
are ruining whole households by
teaching things they ought not to teach--
and that for the sake of dishonest gain.
12Even one of their own prophets has
said, "Cretans are always liars, evil
brutes, lazy gluttons."
13This testimony is true. Therefore,
rebuke them sharply, so that they will be
sound in the faith
14and will pay no attention to Jewish
myths or to the commands of those who
reject the truth.
15To the pure, all things are pure, but to
those who are corrupted and do not
believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both
their minds and consciences are
corrupted.
16They claim to know God, but by their
actions they deny him. They are
detestable, disobedient and unfit for
doing anything good.
2You must teach what is in accord
with sound doctrine.
2Teach the older men to be temperate,
worthy of respect, self-controlled, and
sound in faith, in love and in endurance.
3Likewise, teach the older women to be
reverent in the way they live, not to be
slanderers or addicted to much wine,
but to teach what is good.
4Then they can train the younger women
to love their husbands and children,
5to be self-controlled and pure, to be
busy at home, to be kind, and to be
subject to their husbands, so that no
one will malign the word of God.
6Similarly, encourage the young men to
be self-controlled.
7In everything set them an example by
doing what is good. In your teaching
show integrity, seriousness
8and soundness of speech that cannot
be condemned, so that those who
oppose you may be ashamed because
they have nothing bad to say about us.
9Teach slaves to be subject to their
masters in everything, to try to please
them, not to talk back to them,
10and not to steal from them, but to
show that they can be fully trusted, so
that in every way they will make the
teaching about God our Savior attractive.
11For the grace of God that brings
salvation has appeared to all men.
12It teaches us to say "No" to
ungodliness and worldly passions, and
to live self-controlled, upright and godly
lives in this present age,
13while we wait for the blessed hope--
the glorious appearing of our great God
and Savior, Jesus Christ,
14who gave himself for us to redeem us
from all wickedness and to purify for
himself a people that are his very own,
eager to do what is good.
15These, then, are the things you should
teach. Encourage and rebuke with all
authority. Do not let anyone despise you.
3Remind the people to be subject to
rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to
be ready to do whatever is good,
2to slander no one, to be peaceable and
considerate, and to show true humility
toward all men.
3At one time we too were foolish,
disobedient, deceived and enslaved by
all kinds of passions and pleasures. We
lived in malice and envy, being hated
and hating one another.
4But when the kindness and love of God
our Savior appeared,
5he saved us, not because of righteous
things we had done, but because of his
mercy. He saved us through the
washing of rebirth and renewal by the
Holy Spirit,
6whom he poured out on us generously
through Jesus Christ our Savior,
7so that, having been justified by his
grace, we might become heirs having
the hope of eternal life.
8This is a trustworthy saying. And I want
you to stress these things, so that those
who have trusted in God may be careful
to devote themselves to doing what is
good. These things are excellent and
profitable for everyone.
9But avoid foolish controversies and
genealogies and arguments and
quarrels about the law, because these
are unprofitable and useless.
10Warn a divisive person once, and then
warn him a second time. After that, have
nothing to do with him.
11You may be sure that such a man is
warped and sinful; he is self-condemned.
12As soon as I send Artemas or
Tychicus to you, do your best to come to
me at Nicopolis, because I have decided
to winter there.
13Do everything you can to help Zenas
the lawyer and Apollos on their way and
see that they have everything they need.
14Our people must learn to devote
themselves to doing what is good, in
order that they may provide for daily
necessities and not live unproductive
lives.
15Everyone with me sends you greetings.
Greet those who love us in the faith.
Grace be with you all.
Philemon
1Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and
Timothy our brother,
2To Philemon our dear friend and fellow
worker, to Apphia our sister, to
Archippus our fellow soldier and to the
church that meets in your home:
3Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
4I always thank my God as I remember
you in my prayers,
5because I hear about your faith in the
Lord Jesus and your love for all the
saints.
6I pray that you may be active in sharing
your faith, so that you will have a full
understanding of every good thing we
have in Christ.
7Your love has given me great joy and
encouragement, because you, brother,
have refreshed the hearts of the saints.
8Therefore, although in Christ I could be
bold and order you to do what you ought
to do,
9yet I appeal to you on the basis of love.
I then, as Paul--an old man and now
also a prisoner of Christ Jesus--
10I appeal to you for my son Onesimus,
who became my son while I was in
chains.
11Formerly he was useless to you, but
now he has become useful both to you
and to me.
12I am sending him--who is my very
heart--back to you.
13I would have liked to keep him with me
so that he could take your place in
helping me while I am in chains for the
gospel.
14But I did not want to do anything
without your consent, so that any favor
you do will be spontaneous and not
forced.
15Perhaps the reason he was separated
from you for a little while was that you
might have him back for good--
16no longer as a slave, but better than a
slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear
to me but even dearer to you, both as a
man and as a brother in the Lord.
17So if you consider me a partner,
welcome him as you would welcome me.
18If he has done you any wrong or owes
you anything, charge it to me.
19I, Paul, am writing this with my own
hand. I will pay it back--not to mention
that you owe me your very self.
20I do wish, brother, that I may have
some benefit from you in the Lord;
refresh my heart in Christ.
21Confident of your obedience, I write to
you, knowing that you will do even more
than I ask.
22And one thing more: Prepare a guest
room for me, because I hope to be
restored to you in answer to your
prayers.
23Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ
Jesus, sends you greetings.
24And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas
and Luke, my fellow workers.
25The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit.
Hebrews
1In the past God spoke to our
forefathers through the prophets at
many times and in various ways,
2but in these last days he has spoken to
us by his Son, whom he appointed heir
of all things, and through whom he
made the universe.
3The Son is the radiance of God's glory
and the exact representation of his
being, sustaining all things by his
powerful word. After he had provided
purification for sins, he sat down at the
right hand of the Majesty in heaven.
4So he became as much superior to the
angels as the name he has inherited is
superior to theirs.
5For to which of the angels did God ever
say, "You are my Son; today I have
become your Father " ? Or again, "I will
be his Father, and he will be my Son" ?
6And again, when God brings his
firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all
God's angels worship him."
7In speaking of the angels he says, "He
makes his angels winds, his servants
flames of fire."
8But about the Son he says, "Your
throne, O God, will last for ever and ever,
and righteousness will be the scepter of
your kingdom.
9You have loved righteousness and
hated wickedness; therefore God, your
God, has set you above your
companions by anointing you with the oil
of joy."
10He also says, "In the beginning, O
Lord, you laid the foundations of the
earth, and the heavens are the work of
your hands.
11They will perish, but you remain; they
will all wear out like a garment.
12You will roll them up like a robe; like a
garment they will be changed. But you
remain the same, and your years will
never end."
13To which of the angels did God ever
say, "Sit at my right hand until I make
your enemies a footstool for your feet" ?
14Are not all angels ministering spirits
sent to serve those who will inherit
salvation?
2We must pay more careful attention,
therefore, to what we have heard, so
that we do not drift away.
2For if the message spoken by angels
was binding, and every violation and
disobedience received its just
punishment,
3how shall we escape if we ignore such
a great salvation? This salvation, which
was first announced by the Lord, was
confirmed to us by those who heard him.
4God also testified to it by signs,
wonders and various miracles, and gifts
of the Holy Spirit distributed according to
his will.
5It is not to angels that he has subjected
the world to come, about which we are
speaking.
6But there is a place where someone
has testified: "What is man that you are
mindful of him, the son of man that you
care for him?
7You made him a little lower than the
angels; you crowned him with glory and
honor
8and put everything under his feet.? In
putting everything under him, God left
nothing that is not subject to him. Yet at
present we do not see everything
subject to him.
9But we see Jesus, who was made a
little lower than the grace of God he
might taste death for everyone.
10In bringing many sons to glory, it was
fitting that God, for whom and through
whom everything exists, should make
the author of their salvation perfect
through suffering.
11Both the one who makes men holy
and those who are made holy are of the
same family. So Jesus is not ashamed
to call them brothers.
12He says, "I will declare your name to
my brothers; in the presence of the
congregation I will sing your praises."
13And again, "I will put my trust in him."
And again he says, "Here am I, and the
children God has given me."
14Since the children have flesh and
blood, he too shared in their humanity
so that by his death he might destroy
him who holds the power of death--that
is, the devil--
15and free those who all their lives were
held in slavery by their fear of death.
16For surely it is not angels he helps, but
Abraham's descendants.
17For this reason he had to be made like
his brothers in every way, in order that
he might become a merciful and faithful
high priest in service to God, and that he
might make atonement for the sins of
the people.
18Because he himself suffered when he
was tempted, he is able to help those
who are being tempted.
3Therefore, holy brothers, who share
in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts
on Jesus, the apostle and high priest
whom we confess.
2He was faithful to the one who
appointed him, just as Moses was
faithful in all God's house.
3Jesus has been found worthy of greater
honor than Moses, just as the builder of
a house has greater honor than the
house itself.
4For every house is built by someone,
but God is the builder of everything.
5Moses was faithful as a servant in all
God's house, testifying to what would be
said in the future.
6But Christ is faithful as a son over
God's house. And we are his house, if
we hold on to our courage and the hope
of which we boast.
7So, as the Holy Spirit says: "Today, if
you hear his voice,
8do not harden your hearts as you did in
the rebellion, during the time of testing
in the desert,
9where your fathers tested and tried me
and for forty years saw what I did.
10That is why I was angry with that
generation, and I said, 'Their hearts are
always going astray, and they have not
known my ways.'
11So I declared on oath in my anger,
'They shall never enter my rest.' "
12See to it, brothers, that none of you
has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns
away from the living God.
13But encourage one another daily, as
long as it is called Today, so that none
of you may be hardened by sin's
deceitfulness.
14We have come to share in Christ if we
hold firmly till the end the confidence we
had at first.
15As has just been said: "Today, if you
hear his voice, do not harden your
hearts as you did in the rebellion."
16Who were they who heard and
rebelled? Were they not all those Moses
led out of Egypt?
17And with whom was he angry for forty
years? Was it not with those who sinned,
whose bodies fell in the desert?
18And to whom did God swear that they
would never enter his rest if not to those
who disobeyed ?
19So we see that they were not able to
enter, because of their unbelief.
4Therefore, since the promise of
entering his rest still stands, let us be
careful that none of you be found to
have fallen short of it.
2For we also have had the gospel
preached to us, just as they did; but the
message they heard was of no value to
them, because those who heard did not
combine it with faith.
3Now we who have believed enter that
rest, just as God has said, "So I
declared on oath in my anger, 'They
shall never enter my rest.' "
4And yet his work has been finished
since the creation of the world. For
somewhere he has spoken about the
seventh day in these words: "And on the
seventh day God rested from all his
work."
5And again in the passage above he
says, "They shall never enter my rest."
6It still remains that some will enter that
rest, and those who formerly had the
gospel preached to them did not go in,
because of their disobedience.
7Therefore God again set a certain day,
calling it Today, when a long time later
he spoke through David, as was said
before: "Today, if you hear his voice, do
not harden your hearts."
8For if Joshua had given them rest, God
would not have spoken later about
another day.
9There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for
the people of God;
10for anyone who enters God's rest also
rests from his own work, just as God did
from his.
11Let us, therefore, make every effort to
enter that rest, so that no one will fall by
following their example of disobedience.
12For the word of God is living and
active. Sharper than any double-edged
sword, it penetrates even to dividing
soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it
judges the thoughts and attitudes of the
heart.
13Nothing in all creation is hidden from
God's sight. Everything is uncovered
and laid bare before the eyes of him to
whom we must give account.
14Therefore, since we have a great high
priest who has gone through the
heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us
hold firmly to the faith we profess.
15For we do not have a high priest who
is unable to sympathize with our
weaknesses, but we have one who has
been tempted in every way, just as we
are--yet was without sin.
16Let us then approach the throne of
grace with confidence, so that we may
receive mercy and find grace to help us
in our time of need.
5Every high priest is selected from
among men and is appointed to
represent them in matters related to
God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.
2He is able to deal gently with those who
are ignorant and are going astray, since
he himself is subject to weakness.
3This is why he has to offer sacrifices for
his own sins, as well as for the sins of
the people.
4No one takes this honor upon himself;
he must be called by God, just as Aaron
was.
5So Christ also did not take upon himself
the glory of becoming a high priest. But
God said to him, "You are my Son;
today I have become your Father. "
6And he says in another place, "You are
a priest forever, in the order of
Melchizedek."
7During the days of Jesus' life on earth,
he offered up prayers and petitions with
loud cries and tears to the one who
could save him from death, and he was
heard because of his reverent
submission.
8Although he was a son, he learned
obedience from what he suffered
9and, once made perfect, he became
the source of eternal salvation for all
who obey him
10and was designated by God to be high
priest in the order of Melchizedek.
11We have much to say about this, but it
is hard to explain because you are slow
to learn.
12In fact, though by this time you ought
to be teachers, you need someone to
teach you the elementary truths of God's
word all over again. You need milk, not
solid food!
13Anyone who lives on milk, being still
an infant, is not acquainted with the
teaching about righteousness.
14But solid food is for the mature, who
by constant use have trained
themselves to distinguish good from evil.
6Therefore let us leave the elementary
teachings about Christ and go on to
maturity, not laying again the foundation
of repentance from acts that lead to
death, and of faith in God,
2instruction about baptisms, the laying
on of hands, the resurrection of the
dead, and eternal judgment.
3And God permitting, we will do so.
4It is impossible for those who have
once been enlightened, who have tasted
the heavenly gift, who have shared in
the Holy Spirit,
5who have tasted the goodness of the
word of God and the powers of the
coming age,
6if they fall away, to be brought back to
repentance, because to their loss they
are crucifying the Son of God all over
again and subjecting him to public
disgrace.
7Land that drinks in the rain often falling
on it and that produces a crop useful to
those for whom it is farmed receives the
blessing of God.
8But land that produces thorns and
thistles is worthless and is in danger of
being cursed. In the end it will be burned.
9Even though we speak like this, dear
friends, we are confident of better things
in your case--things that accompany
salvation.
10God is not unjust; he will not forget
your work and the love you have shown
him as you have helped his people and
continue to help them.
11We want each of you to show this
same diligence to the very end, in order
to make your hope sure.
12We do not want you to become lazy,
but to imitate those who through faith
and patience inherit what has been
promised.
13When God made his promise to
Abraham, since there was no one
greater for him to swear by, he swore by
himself,
14saying, "I will surely bless you and give
you many descendants."
15And so after waiting patiently,
Abraham received what was promised.
16Men swear by someone greater than
themselves, and the oath confirms what
is said and puts an end to all argument.
17Because God wanted to make the
unchanging nature of his purpose very
clear to the heirs of what was promised,
he confirmed it with an oath.
18God did this so that, by two
unchangeable things in which it is
impossible for God to lie, we who have
fled to take hold of the hope offered to
us may be greatly encouraged.
19We have this hope as an anchor for
the soul, firm and secure. It enters the
inner sanctuary behind the curtain,
20where Jesus, who went before us, has
entered on our behalf. He has become a
high priest forever, in the order of
Melchizedek.
7This Melchizedek was king of Salem
and priest of God Most High. He met
Abraham returning from the defeat of
the kings and blessed him,
2and Abraham gave him a tenth of
everything. First, his name means "king
of righteousness"; then also, "king of
Salem" means "king of peace."
3Without father or mother, without
genealogy, without beginning of days or
end of life, like the Son of God he
remains a priest forever.
4Just think how great he was: Even the
patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of
the plunder!
5Now the law requires the descendants
of Levi who become priests to collect a
tenth from the people--that is, their
brothers--even though their brothers are
descended from Abraham.
6This man, however, did not trace his
descent from Levi, yet he collected a
tenth from Abraham and blessed him
who had the promises.
7And without doubt the lesser person is
blessed by the greater.
8In the one case, the tenth is collected
by men who die; but in the other case,
by him who is declared to be living.
9One might even say that Levi, who
collects the tenth, paid the tenth through
Abraham,
10because when Melchizedek met
Abraham, Levi was still in the body of
his ancestor.
11If perfection could have been attained
through the Levitical priesthood (for on
the basis of it the law was given to the
people), why was there still need for
another priest to come--one in the order
of Melchizedek, not in the order of
Aaron?
12For when there is a change of the
priesthood, there must also be a change
of the law.
13He of whom these things are said
belonged to a different tribe, and no one
from that tribe has ever served at the
altar.
14For it is clear that our Lord descended
from Judah, and in regard to that tribe
Moses said nothing about priests.
15And what we have said is even more
clear if another priest like Melchizedek
appears,
16one who has become a priest not on
the basis of a regulation as to his
ancestry but on the basis of the power
of an indestructible life.
17For it is declared: "You are a priest
forever, in the order of Melchizedek."
18The former regulation is set aside
because it was weak and useless
19(for the law made nothing perfect), and
a better hope is introduced, by which we
draw near to God.
20And it was not without an oath! Others
became priests without any oath,
21but he became a priest with an oath
when God said to him: "The Lord has
sworn and will not change his mind:
'You are a priest forever.' "
22Because of this oath, Jesus has
become the guarantee of a better
covenant.
23Now there have been many of those
priests, since death prevented them
from continuing in office;
24but because Jesus lives forever, he
has a permanent priesthood.
25Therefore he is able to save
completely those who come to God
through him, because he always lives to
intercede for them.
26Such a high priest meets our need--
one who is holy, blameless, pure, set
apart from sinners, exalted above the
heavens.
27Unlike the other high priests, he does
not need to offer sacrifices day after day,
first for his own sins, and then for the
sins of the people. He sacrificed for their
sins once for all when he offered himself.
28For the law appoints as high priests
men who are weak; but the oath, which
came after the law, appointed the Son,
who has been made perfect forever.
8The point of what we are saying is
this: We do have such a high priest, who
sat down at the right hand of the throne
of the Majesty in heaven,
2and who serves in the sanctuary, the
true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not
by man.
3Every high priest is appointed to offer
both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was
necessary for this one also to have
something to offer.
4If he were on earth, he would not be a
priest, for there are already men who
offer the gifts prescribed by the law.
5They serve at a sanctuary that is a
copy and shadow of what is in heaven.
This is why Moses was warned when he
was about to build the tabernacle: "See
to it that you make everything according
to the pattern shown you on the
mountain."
6But the ministry Jesus has received is
as superior to theirs as the covenant of
which he is mediator is superior to the
old one, and it is founded on better
promises.
7For if there had been nothing wrong
with that first covenant, no place would
have been sought for another.
8But God found fault with the people and
said : "The time is coming, declares the
Lord, when I will make a new covenant
with the house of Israel and with the
house of Judah.
9It will not be like the covenant I made
with their forefathers when I took them
by the hand to lead them out of Egypt,
because they did not remain faithful to
my covenant, and I turned away from
them, declares the Lord.
10This is the covenant I will make with
the house of Israel after that time,
declares the Lord. I will put my laws in
their minds and write them on their
hearts. I will be their God, and they will
be my people.
11No longer will a man teach his
neighbor, or a man his brother, saying,
'Know the Lord,' because they will all
know me, from the least of them to the
greatest.
12For I will forgive their wickedness and
will remember their sins no more."
13By calling this covenant "new," he has
made the first one obsolete; and what is
obsolete and aging will soon disappear.
9Now the first covenant had
regulations for worship and also an
earthly sanctuary.
2A tabernacle was set up. In its first
room were the lampstand, the table and
the consecrated bread; this was called
the Holy Place.
3Behind the second curtain was a room
called the Most Holy Place,
4which had the golden altar of incense
and the gold-covered ark of the
covenant. This ark contained the gold
jar of manna, Aaron's staff that had
budded, and the stone tablets of the
covenant.
5Above the ark were the cherubim of the
Glory, overshadowing the atonement
cover. But we cannot discuss these
things in detail now.
6When everything had been arranged
like this, the priests entered regularly
into the outer room to carry on their
ministry.
7But only the high priest entered the
inner room, and that only once a year,
and never without blood, which he
offered for himself and for the sins the
people had committed in ignorance.
8The Holy Spirit was showing by this
that the way into the Most Holy Place
had not yet been disclosed as long as
the first tabernacle was still standing.
9This is an illustration for the present
time, indicating that the gifts and
sacrifices being offered were not able to
clear the conscience of the worshiper.
10They are only a matter of food and
drink and various ceremonial washings--
external regulations applying until the
time of the new order.
11When Christ came as high priest of the
good things that are already here, he
went through the greater and more
perfect tabernacle that is not man-made,
that is to say, not a part of this creation.
12He did not enter by means of the blood
of goats and calves; but he entered the
Most Holy Place once for all by his own
blood, having obtained eternal
redemption.
13The blood of goats and bulls and the
ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who
are ceremonially unclean sanctify them
so that they are outwardly clean.
14How much more, then, will the blood of
Christ, who through the eternal Spirit
offered himself unblemished to God,
cleanse our consciences from acts that
lead to death, so that we may serve the
living God!
15For this reason Christ is the mediator
of a new covenant, that those who are
called may receive the promised eternal
inheritance--now that he has died as a
ransom to set them free from the sins
committed under the first covenant.
16In the case of a will, it is necessary to
prove the death of the one who made it,
17because a will is in force only when
somebody has died; it never takes effect
while the one who made it is living.
18This is why even the first covenant
was not put into effect without blood.
19When Moses had proclaimed every
commandment of the law to all the
people, he took the blood of calves,
together with water, scarlet wool and
branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the
scroll and all the people.
20He said, "This is the blood of the
covenant, which God has commanded
you to keep."
21In the same way, he sprinkled with the
blood both the tabernacle and
everything used in its ceremonies.
22In fact, the law requires that nearly
everything be cleansed with blood, and
without the shedding of blood there is no
forgiveness.
23It was necessary, then, for the copies
of the heavenly things to be purified with
these sacrifices, but the heavenly things
themselves with better sacrifices than
these.
24For Christ did not enter a man-made
sanctuary that was only a copy of the
true one; he entered heaven itself, now
to appear for us in God's presence.
25Nor did he enter heaven to offer
himself again and again, the way the
high priest enters the Most Holy Place
every year with blood that is not his own.
26Then Christ would have had to suffer
many times since the creation of the
world. But now he has appeared once
for all at the end of the ages to do away
with sin by the sacrifice of himself.
27Just as man is destined to die once,
and after that to face judgment,
28so Christ was sacrificed once to take
away the sins of many people; and he
will appear a second time, not to bear
sin, but to bring salvation to those who
are waiting for him.
10The law is only a shadow of the
good things that are coming--not the
realities themselves. For this reason it
can never, by the same sacrifices
repeated endlessly year after year,
make perfect those who draw near to
worship.
2If it could, would they not have stopped
being offered? For the worshipers would
have been cleansed once for all, and
would no longer have felt guilty for their
sins.
3But those sacrifices are an annual
reminder of sins,
4because it is impossible for the blood of
bulls and goats to take away sins.
5Therefore, when Christ came into the
world, he said: "Sacrifice and offering
you did not desire, but a body you
prepared for me;
6with burnt offerings and sin offerings
you were not pleased.
7Then I said, 'Here I am--it is written
about me in the scroll-- I have come to
do your will, O God.' "
8First he said, "Sacrifices and offerings,
burnt offerings and sin offerings you did
not desire, nor were you pleased with
them" (although the law required them
to be made).
9Then he said, "Here I am, I have come
to do your will." He sets aside the first to
establish the second.
10And by that will, we have been made
holy through the sacrifice of the body of
Jesus Christ once for all.
11Day after day every priest stands and
performs his religious duties; again and
again he offers the same sacrifices,
which can never take away sins.
12But when this priest had offered for all
time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down
at the right hand of God.
13Since that time he waits for his
enemies to be made his footstool,
14because by one sacrifice he has made
perfect forever those who are being
made holy.
15The Holy Spirit also testifies to us
about this. First he says:
16"This is the covenant I will make with
them after that time, says the Lord. I will
put my laws in their hearts, and I will
write them on their minds."
17Then he adds: "Their sins and lawless
acts I will remember no more."
18And where these have been forgiven,
there is no longer any sacrifice for sin.
19Therefore, brothers, since we have
confidence to enter the Most Holy Place
by the blood of Jesus,
20by a new and living way opened for us
through the curtain, that is, his body,
21and since we have a great priest over
the house of God,
22let us draw near to God with a sincere
heart in full assurance of faith, having
our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from
a guilty conscience and having our
bodies washed with pure water.
23Let us hold unswervingly to the hope
we profess, for he who promised is
faithful.
24And let us consider how we may spur
one another on toward love and good
deeds.
25Let us not give up meeting together,
as some are in the habit of doing, but let
us encourage one another--and all the
more as you see the Day approaching.
26If we deliberately keep on sinning after
we have received the knowledge of the
truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,
27but only a fearful expectation of
judgment and of raging fire that will
consume the enemies of God.
28Anyone who rejected the law of Moses
died without mercy on the testimony of
two or three witnesses.
29How much more severely do you think
a man deserves to be punished who has
trampled the Son of God under foot,
who has treated as an unholy thing the
blood of the covenant that sanctified him,
and who has insulted the Spirit of
grace?
30For we know him who said, "It is mine
to avenge; I will repay," and again, "The
Lord will judge his people."
31It is a dreadful thing to fall into the
hands of the living God.
32Remember those earlier days after
you had received the light, when you
stood your ground in a great contest in
the face of suffering.
33Sometimes you were publicly exposed
to insult and persecution; at other times
you stood side by side with those who
were so treated.
34You sympathized with those in prison
and joyfully accepted the confiscation of
your property, because you knew that
you yourselves had better and lasting
possessions.
35So do not throw away your confidence;
it will be richly rewarded.
36You need to persevere so that when
you have done the will of God, you will
receive what he has promised.
37For in just a very little while, "He who
is coming will come and will not delay.
38But my righteous one will live by faith.
And if he shrinks back, I will not be
pleased with him."
39But we are not of those who shrink
back and are destroyed, but of those
who believe and are saved.
11Now faith is being sure of what we
hope for and certain of what we do not
see.
2This is what the ancients were
commended for.
3By faith we understand that the
universe was formed at God's command,
so that what is seen was not made out
of what was visible.
4By faith Abel offered God a better
sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was
commended as a righteous man, when
God spoke well of his offerings. And by
faith he still speaks, even though he is
dead.
5By faith Enoch was taken from this life,
so that he did not experience death; he
could not be found, because God had
taken him away. For before he was
taken, he was commended as one who
pleased God.
6And without faith it is impossible to
please God, because anyone who
comes to him must believe that he
exists and that he rewards those who
earnestly seek him.
7By faith Noah, when warned about
things not yet seen, in holy fear built an
ark to save his family. By his faith he
condemned the world and became heir
of the righteousness that comes by faith.
8By faith Abraham, when called to go to
a place he would later receive as his
inheritance, obeyed and went, even
though he did not know where he was
going.
9By faith he made his home in the
promised land like a stranger in a
foreign country; he lived in tents, as did
Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with
him of the same promise.
10For he was looking forward to the city
with foundations, whose architect and
builder is God.
11By faith Abraham, even though he was
past age--and Sarah herself was barren-
-was enabled to become a father
because he considered him faithful who
had made the promise.
12And so from this one man, and he as
good as dead, came descendants as
numerous as the stars in the sky and as
countless as the sand on the seashore.
13All these people were still living by
faith when they died. They did not
receive the things promised; they only
saw them and welcomed them from a
distance. And they admitted that they
were aliens and strangers on earth.
14People who say such things show that
they are looking for a country of their
own.
15If they had been thinking of the country
they had left, they would have had
opportunity to return.
16Instead, they were longing for a better
country--a heavenly one. Therefore God
is not ashamed to be called their God,
for he has prepared a city for them.
17By faith Abraham, when God tested
him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He
who had received the promises was
about to sacrifice his one and only son,
18even though God had said to him, "It is
through Isaac that your offspring will be
reckoned."
19Abraham reasoned that God could
raise the dead, and figuratively speaking,
he did receive Isaac back from death.
20By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
in regard to their future.
21By faith Jacob, when he was dying,
blessed each of Joseph's sons, and
worshiped as he leaned on the top of his
staff.
22By faith Joseph, when his end was
near, spoke about the exodus of the
Israelites from Egypt and gave
instructions about his bones.
23By faith Moses' parents hid him for
three months after he was born,
because they saw he was no ordinary
child, and they were not afraid of the
king's edict.
24By faith Moses, when he had grown up,
refused to be known as the son of
Pharaoh's daughter.
25He chose to be mistreated along with
the people of God rather than to enjoy
the pleasures of sin for a short time.
26He regarded disgrace for the sake of
Christ as of greater value than the
treasures of Egypt, because he was
looking ahead to his reward.
27By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the
king's anger; he persevered because he
saw him who is invisible.
28By faith he kept the Passover and the
sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer
of the firstborn would not touch the
firstborn of Israel.
29By faith the people passed through the
Red Sea as on dry land; but when the
Egyptians tried to do so, they were
drowned.
30By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after
the people had marched around them
for seven days.
31By faith the prostitute Rahab, because
she welcomed the spies, was not killed
with those who were disobedient.
32And what more shall I say? I do not
have time to tell about Gideon, Barak,
Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and
the prophets,
33who through faith conquered kingdoms,
administered justice, and gained what
was promised; who shut the mouths of
lions,
34quenched the fury of the flames, and
escaped the edge of the sword; whose
weakness was turned to strength; and
who became powerful in battle and
routed foreign armies.
35Women received back their dead,
raised to life again. Others were tortured
and refused to be released, so that they
might gain a better resurrection.
36Some faced jeers and flogging, while
still others were chained and put in
prison.
37They were stoned ; they were sawed
in two; they were put to death by the
sword. They went about in sheepskins
and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and
mistreated--
38the world was not worthy of them.
They wandered in deserts and
mountains, and in caves and holes in
the ground.
39These were all commended for their
faith, yet none of them received what
had been promised.
40God had planned something better for
us so that only together with us would
they be made perfect.
12Therefore, since we are
surrounded by such a great cloud of
witnesses, let us throw off everything
that hinders and the sin that so easily
entangles, and let us run with
perseverance the race marked out for
us.
2Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author
and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy
set before him endured the cross,
scorning its shame, and sat down at the
right hand of the throne of God.
3Consider him who endured such
opposition from sinful men, so that you
will not grow weary and lose heart.
4In your struggle against sin, you have
not yet resisted to the point of shedding
your blood.
5And you have forgotten that word of
encouragement that addresses you as
sons: "My son, do not make light of the
Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart
when he rebukes you,
6because the Lord disciplines those he
loves, and he punishes everyone he
accepts as a son."
7Endure hardship as discipline; God is
treating you as sons. For what son is not
disciplined by his father?
8If you are not disciplined (and everyone
undergoes discipline), then you are
illegitimate children and not true sons.
9Moreover, we have all had human
fathers who disciplined us and we
respected them for it. How much more
should we submit to the Father of our
spirits and live!
10Our fathers disciplined us for a little
while as they thought best; but God
disciplines us for our good, that we may
share in his holiness.
11No discipline seems pleasant at the
time, but painful. Later on, however, it
produces a harvest of righteousness
and peace for those who have been
trained by it.
12Therefore, strengthen your feeble
arms and weak knees.
13"Make level paths for your feet," so
that the lame may not be disabled, but
rather healed.
14Make every effort to live in peace with
all men and to be holy; without holiness
no one will see the Lord.
15See to it that no one misses the grace
of God and that no bitter root grows up
to cause trouble and defile many.
16See that no one is sexually immoral, or
is godless like Esau, who for a single
meal sold his inheritance rights as the
oldest son.
17Afterward, as you know, when he
wanted to inherit this blessing, he was
rejected. He could bring about no
change of mind, though he sought the
blessing with tears.
18You have not come to a mountain that
can be touched and that is burning with
fire; to darkness, gloom and storm;
19to a trumpet blast or to such a voice
speaking words that those who heard it
begged that no further word be spoken
to them,
20because they could not bear what was
commanded: "If even an animal touches
the mountain, it must be stoned."
21The sight was so terrifying that Moses
said, "I am trembling with fear."
22But you have come to Mount Zion, to
the heavenly Jerusalem, the city of the
living God. You have come to thousands
upon thousands of angels in joyful
assembly,
23to the church of the firstborn, whose
names are written in heaven. You have
come to God, the judge of all men, to
the spirits of righteous men made
perfect,
24to Jesus the mediator of a new
covenant, and to the sprinkled blood
that speaks a better word than the blood
of Abel.
25See to it that you do not refuse him
who speaks. If they did not escape
when they refused him who warned
them on earth, how much less will we, if
we turn away from him who warns us
from heaven?
26At that time his voice shook the earth,
but now he has promised, "Once more I
will shake not only the earth but also the
heavens."
27The words "once more" indicate the
removing of what can be shaken--that is,
created things--so that what cannot be
shaken may remain.
28Therefore, since we are receiving a
kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us
be thankful, and so worship God
acceptably with reverence and awe,
29for our "God is a consuming fire."
13Keep on loving each other as
brothers.
2Do not forget to entertain strangers, for
by so doing some people have
entertained angels without knowing it.
3Remember those in prison as if you
were their fellow prisoners, and those
who are mistreated as if you yourselves
were suffering.
4Marriage should be honored by all, and
the marriage bed kept pure, for God will
judge the adulterer and all the sexually
immoral.
5Keep your lives free from the love of
money and be content with what you
have, because God has said, "Never will
I leave you; never will I forsake you."
6So we say with confidence, "The Lord
is my helper; I will not be afraid. What
can man do to me?"
7Remember your leaders, who spoke
the word of God to you. Consider the
outcome of their way of life and imitate
their faith.
8Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and
today and forever.
9Do not be carried away by all kinds of
strange teachings. It is good for our
hearts to be strengthened by grace, not
by ceremonial foods, which are of no
value to those who eat them.
10We have an altar from which those
who minister at the tabernacle have no
right to eat.
11The high priest carries the blood of
animals into the Most Holy Place as a
sin offering, but the bodies are burned
outside the camp.
12And so Jesus also suffered outside the
city gate to make the people holy
through his own blood.
13Let us, then, go to him outside the
camp, bearing the disgrace he bore.
14For here we do not have an enduring
city, but we are looking for the city that
is to come.
15Through Jesus, therefore, let us
continually offer to God a sacrifice of
praise--the fruit of lips that confess his
name.
16And do not forget to do good and to
share with others, for with such
sacrifices God is pleased.
17Obey your leaders and submit to their
authority. They keep watch over you as
men who must give an account. Obey
them so that their work will be a joy, not
a burden, for that would be of no
advantage to you.
18Pray for us. We are sure that we have
a clear conscience and desire to live
honorably in every way.
19I particularly urge you to pray so that I
may be restored to you soon.
20May the God of peace, who through
the blood of the eternal covenant
brought back from the dead our Lord
Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep,
21equip you with everything good for
doing his will, and may he work in us
what is pleasing to him, through Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory for ever and
ever. Amen.
22Brothers, I urge you to bear with my
word of exhortation, for I have written
you only a short letter.
23I want you to know that our brother
Timothy has been released. If he arrives
soon, I will come with him to see you.
24Greet all your leaders and all God's
people. Those from Italy send you their
greetings.
25Grace be with you all.
James
1James, a servant of God and of the
Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes
scattered among the nations: Greetings.
2Consider it pure joy, my brothers,
whenever you face trials of many kinds,
3because you know that the testing of
your faith develops perseverance.
4Perseverance must finish its work so
that you may be mature and complete,
not lacking anything.
5If any of you lacks wisdom, he should
ask God, who gives generously to all
without finding fault, and it will be given
to him.
6But when he asks, he must believe and
not doubt, because he who doubts is
like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed
by the wind.
7That man should not think he will
receive anything from the Lord;
8he is a double-minded man, unstable in
all he does.
9The brother in humble circumstances
ought to take pride in his high position.
10But the one who is rich should take
pride in his low position, because he will
pass away like a wild flower.
11For the sun rises with scorching heat
and withers the plant; its blossom falls
and its beauty is destroyed. In the same
way, the rich man will fade away even
while he goes about his business.
12Blessed is the man who perseveres
under trial, because when he has stood
the test, he will receive the crown of life
that God has promised to those who
love him.
13When tempted, no one should say,
"God is tempting me." For God cannot
be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt
anyone;
14but each one is tempted when, by his
own evil desire, he is dragged away and
enticed.
15Then, after desire has conceived, it
gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is fullgrown,
gives birth to death.
16Don't be deceived, my dear brothers.
17Every good and perfect gift is from
above, coming down from the Father of
the heavenly lights, who does not
change like shifting shadows.
18He chose to give us birth through the
word of truth, that we might be a kind of
firstfruits of all he created.
19My dear brothers, take note of this:
Everyone should be quick to listen, slow
to speak and slow to become angry,
20for man's anger does not bring about
the righteous life that God desires.
21Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and
the evil that is so prevalent and humbly
accept the word planted in you, which
can save you.
22Do not merely listen to the word, and
so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.
23Anyone who listens to the word but
does not do what it says is like a man
who looks at his face in a mirror
24and, after looking at himself, goes
away and immediately forgets what he
looks like.
25But the man who looks intently into the
perfect law that gives freedom, and
continues to do this, not forgetting what
he has heard, but doing it--he will be
blessed in what he does.
26If anyone considers himself religious
and yet does not keep a tight rein on his
tongue, he deceives himself and his
religion is worthless.
27Religion that God our Father accepts
as pure and faultless is this: to look after
orphans and widows in their distress
and to keep oneself from being polluted
by the world.
2My brothers, as believers in our
glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show
favoritism.
2Suppose a man comes into your
meeting wearing a gold ring and fine
clothes, and a poor man in shabby
clothes also comes in.
3If you show special attention to the man
wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a
good seat for you," but say to the poor
man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the
floor by my feet,"
4have you not discriminated among
yourselves and become judges with evil
thoughts?
5Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God
chosen those who are poor in the eyes
of the world to be rich in faith and to
inherit the kingdom he promised those
who love him?
6But you have insulted the poor. Is it not
the rich who are exploiting you? Are
they not the ones who are dragging you
into court?
7Are they not the ones who are
slandering the noble name of him to
whom you belong?
8If you really keep the royal law found in
Scripture, "Love your neighbor as
yourself," you are doing right.
9But if you show favoritism, you sin and
are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.
10For whoever keeps the whole law and
yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of
breaking all of it.
11For he who said, "Do not commit
adultery," also said, "Do not murder." If
you do not commit adultery but do
commit murder, you have become a
lawbreaker.
12Speak and act as those who are going
to be judged by the law that gives
freedom,
13because judgment without mercy will
be shown to anyone who has not been
merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment!
14What good is it, my brothers, if a man
claims to have faith but has no deeds?
Can such faith save him?
15Suppose a brother or sister is without
clothes and daily food.
16If one of you says to him, "Go, I wish
you well; keep warm and well fed," but
does nothing about his physical needs,
what good is it?
17In the same way, faith by itself, if it is
not accompanied by action, is dead.
18But someone will say, "You have faith;
I have deeds."
19Show me your faith without deeds, and
I will show you my faith by what I do.
You believe that there is one God.
Good! Even the demons believe that--
and shudder.
20You foolish man, do you want
evidence that faith without deeds is
useless ?
21Was not our ancestor Abraham
considered righteous for what he did
when he offered his son Isaac on the
altar?
22You see that his faith and his actions
were working together, and his faith was
made complete by what he did.
23And the scripture was fulfilled that
says, "Abraham believed God, and it
was credited to him as righteousness,"
and he was called God's friend.
24You see that a person is justified by
what he does and not by faith alone.
25In the same way, was not even Rahab
the prostitute considered righteous for
what she did when she gave lodging to
the spies and sent them off in a different
direction?
26As the body without the spirit is dead,
so faith without deeds is dead.
3Not many of you should presume to
be teachers, my brothers, because you
know that we who teach will be judged
more strictly.
2We all stumble in many ways. If anyone
is never at fault in what he says, he is a
perfect man, able to keep his whole
body in check.
3When we put bits into the mouths of
horses to make them obey us, we can
turn the whole animal.
4Or take ships as an example. Although
they are so large and are driven by
strong winds, they are steered by a very
small rudder wherever the pilot wants to
go.
5Likewise the tongue is a small part of
the body, but it makes great boasts.
Consider what a great forest is set on
fire by a small spark.
6The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil
among the parts of the body. It corrupts
the whole person, sets the whole course
of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire
by hell.
7All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and
creatures of the sea are being tamed
and have been tamed by man,
8but no man can tame the tongue. It is a
restless evil, full of deadly poison.
9With the tongue we praise our Lord and
Father, and with it we curse men, who
have been made in God's likeness.
10Out of the same mouth come praise
and cursing. My brothers, this should
not be.
11Can both fresh water and salt water
flow from the same spring?
12My brothers, can a fig tree bear olives,
or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a
salt spring produce fresh water.
13Who is wise and understanding among
you? Let him show it by his good life, by
deeds done in the humility that comes
from wisdom.
14But if you harbor bitter envy and
selfish ambition in your hearts, do not
boast about it or deny the truth.
15Such "wisdom" does not come down
from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual,
of the devil.
16For where you have envy and selfish
ambition, there you find disorder and
every evil practice.
17But the wisdom that comes from
heaven is first of all pure; then peaceloving,
considerate, submissive, full of
mercy and good fruit, impartial and
sincere.
18Peacemakers who sow in peace raise
a harvest of righteousness.
4What causes fights and quarrels
among you? Don't they come from your
desires that battle within you?
2You want something but don't get it.
You kill and covet, but you cannot have
what you want. You quarrel and fight.
You do not have, because you do not
ask God.
3When you ask, you do not receive,
because you ask with wrong motives,
that you may spend what you get on
your pleasures.
4You adulterous people, don't you know
that friendship with the world is hatred
toward God? Anyone who chooses to
be a friend of the world becomes an
enemy of God.
5Or do you think Scripture says without
reason that the spirit he caused to live in
us envies intensely?
6But he gives us more grace. That is
why Scripture says: "God opposes the
proud but gives grace to the humble."
7Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist
the devil, and he will flee from you.
8Come near to God and he will come
near to you. Wash your hands, you
sinners, and purify your hearts, you
double-minded.
9Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your
laughter to mourning and your joy to
gloom.
10Humble yourselves before the Lord,
and he will lift you up.
11Brothers, do not slander one another.
Anyone who speaks against his brother
or judges him speaks against the law
and judges it. When you judge the law,
you are not keeping it, but sitting in
judgment on it.
12There is only one Lawgiver and Judge,
the one who is able to save and destroy.
But you--who are you to judge your
neighbor?
13Now listen, you who say, "Today or
tomorrow we will go to this or that city,
spend a year there, carry on business
and make money."
14Why, you do not even know what will
happen tomorrow. What is your life?
You are a mist that appears for a little
while and then vanishes.
15Instead, you ought to say, "If it is the
Lord's will, we will live and do this or
that."
16As it is, you boast and brag. All such
boasting is evil.
17Anyone, then, who knows the good he
ought to do and doesn't do it, sins.
5Now listen, you rich people, weep
and wail because of the misery that is
coming upon you.
2Your wealth has rotted, and moths
have eaten your clothes.
3Your gold and silver are corroded. Their
corrosion will testify against you and eat
your flesh like fire. You have hoarded
wealth in the last days.
4Look! The wages you failed to pay the
workmen who mowed your fields are
crying out against you. The cries of the
harvesters have reached the ears of the
Lord Almighty.
5You have lived on earth in luxury and
self-indulgence. You have fattened
yourselves in the day of slaughter.
6You have condemned and murdered
innocent men, who were not opposing
you.
7Be patient, then, brothers, until the
Lord's coming. See how the farmer
waits for the land to yield its valuable
crop and how patient he is for the
autumn and spring rains.
8You too, be patient and stand firm,
because the Lord's coming is near.
9Don't grumble against each other,
brothers, or you will be judged. The
Judge is standing at the door!
10Brothers, as an example of patience in
the face of suffering, take the prophets
who spoke in the name of the Lord.
11As you know, we consider blessed
those who have persevered. You have
heard of Job's perseverance and have
seen what the Lord finally brought about.
The Lord is full of compassion and
mercy.
12Above all, my brothers, do not swear--
not by heaven or by earth or by anything
else. Let your "Yes" be yes, and your
"No," no, or you will be condemned.
13Is any one of you in trouble? He
should pray. Is anyone happy? Let him
sing songs of praise.
14Is any one of you sick? He should call
the elders of the church to pray over him
and anoint him with oil in the name of
the Lord.
15And the prayer offered in faith will
make the sick person well; the Lord will
raise him up. If he has sinned, he will be
forgiven.
16Therefore confess your sins to each
other and pray for each other so that
you may be healed. The prayer of a
righteous man is powerful and effective.
17Elijah was a man just like us. He
prayed earnestly that it would not rain,
and it did not rain on the land for three
and a half years.
18Again he prayed, and the heavens
gave rain, and the earth produced its
crops.
19My brothers, if one of you should
wander from the truth and someone
should bring him back,
20remember this: Whoever turns a
sinner from the error of his way will save
him from death and cover over a
multitude of sins.
1st Peter
1Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To
God's elect, strangers in the world,
scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia,
Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,
2who have been chosen according to
the foreknowledge of God the Father,
through the sanctifying work of the Spirit,
for obedience to Jesus Christ and
sprinkling by his blood: Grace and
peace be yours in abundance.
3Praise be to the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he
has given us new birth into a living hope
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
from the dead,
4and into an inheritance that can never
perish, spoil or fade--kept in heaven for
you,
5who through faith are shielded by God's
power until the coming of the salvation
that is ready to be revealed in the last
time.
6In this you greatly rejoice, though now
for a little while you may have had to
suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
7These have come so that your faith--of
greater worth than gold, which perishes
even though refined by fire--may be
proved genuine and may result in praise,
glory and honor when Jesus Christ is
revealed.
8Though you have not seen him, you
love him; and even though you do not
see him now, you believe in him and are
filled with an inexpressible and glorious
joy,
9for you are receiving the goal of your
faith, the salvation of your souls.
10Concerning this salvation, the
prophets, who spoke of the grace that
was to come to you, searched intently
and with the greatest care,
11trying to find out the time and
circumstances to which the Spirit of
Christ in them was pointing when he
predicted the sufferings of Christ and
the glories that would follow.
12It was revealed to them that they were
not serving themselves but you, when
they spoke of the things that have now
been told you by those who have
preached the gospel to you by the Holy
Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels
long to look into these things.
13Therefore, prepare your minds for
action; be self-controlled; set your hope
fully on the grace to be given you when
Jesus Christ is revealed.
14As obedient children, do not conform
to the evil desires you had when you
lived in ignorance.
15But just as he who called you is holy,
so be holy in all you do;
16for it is written: "Be holy, because I am
holy."
17Since you call on a Father who judges
each man's work impartially, live your
lives as strangers here in reverent fear.
18For you know that it was not with
perishable things such as silver or gold
that you were redeemed from the empty
way of life handed down to you from
your forefathers,
19but with the precious blood of Christ, a
lamb without blemish or defect.
20He was chosen before the creation of
the world, but was revealed in these last
times for your sake.
21Through him you believe in God, who
raised him from the dead and glorified
him, and so your faith and hope are in
God.
22Now that you have purified yourselves
by obeying the truth so that you have
sincere love for your brothers, love one
another deeply, from the heart.
23For you have been born again, not of
perishable seed, but of imperishable,
through the living and enduring word of
God.
24For, "All men are like grass, and all
their glory is like the flowers of the field;
the grass withers and the flowers fall,
25but the word of the Lord stands
forever." And this is the word that was
preached to you.
2Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice
and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and
slander of every kind.
2Like newborn babies, crave pure
spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow
up in your salvation,
3now that you have tasted that the Lord
is good.
4As you come to him, the living Stone--
rejected by men but chosen by God and
precious to him--
5you also, like living stones, are being
built into a spiritual house to be a holy
priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices
acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
6For in Scripture it says: "See, I lay a
stone in Zion, a chosen and precious
cornerstone, and the one who trusts in
him will never be put to shame."
7Now to you who believe, this stone is
precious. But to those who do not
believe, "The stone the builders rejected
has become the capstone, "
8and, "A stone that causes men to
stumble and a rock that makes them
fall." They stumble because they
disobey the message--which is also
what they were destined for.
9But you are a chosen people, a royal
priesthood, a holy nation, a people
belonging to God, that you may declare
the praises of him who called you out of
darkness into his wonderful light.
10Once you were not a people, but now
you are the people of God; once you
had not received mercy, but now you
have received mercy.
11Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and
strangers in the world, to abstain from
sinful desires, which war against your
soul.
12Live such good lives among the
pagans that, though they accuse you of
doing wrong, they may see your good
deeds and glorify God on the day he
visits us.
13Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake
to every authority instituted among men:
whether to the king, as the supreme
authority,
14or to governors, who are sent by him
to punish those who do wrong and to
commend those who do right.
15For it is God's will that by doing good
you should silence the ignorant talk of
foolish men.
16Live as free men, but do not use your
freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as
servants of God.
17Show proper respect to everyone:
Love the brotherhood of believers, fear
God, honor the king.
18Slaves, submit yourselves to your
masters with all respect, not only to
those who are good and considerate,
but also to those who are harsh.
19For it is commendable if a man bears
up under the pain of unjust suffering
because he is conscious of God.
20But how is it to your credit if you
receive a beating for doing wrong and
endure it? But if you suffer for doing
good and you endure it, this is
commendable before God.
21To this you were called, because
Christ suffered for you, leaving you an
example, that you should follow in his
steps.
22"He committed no sin, and no deceit
was found in his mouth."
23When they hurled their insults at him,
he did not retaliate; when he suffered,
he made no threats. Instead, he
entrusted himself to him who judges
justly.
24He himself bore our sins in his body on
the tree, so that we might die to sins and
live for righteousness; by his wounds
you have been healed.
25For you were like sheep going astray,
but now you have returned to the
Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
3Wives, in the same way be
submissive to your husbands so that, if
any of them do not believe the word,
they may be won over without words by
the behavior of their wives,
2when they see the purity and reverence
of your lives.
3Your beauty should not come from
outward adornment, such as braided
hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and
fine clothes.
4Instead, it should be that of your inner
self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and
quiet spirit, which is of great worth in
God's sight.
5For this is the way the holy women of
the past who put their hope in God used
to make themselves beautiful. They
were submissive to their own husbands,
6like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and
called him her master. You are her
daughters if you do what is right and do
not give way to fear.
7Husbands, in the same way be
considerate as you live with your wives,
and treat them with respect as the
weaker partner and as heirs with you of
the gracious gift of life, so that nothing
will hinder your prayers.
8Finally, all of you, live in harmony with
one another; be sympathetic, love as
brothers, be compassionate and humble.
9Do not repay evil with evil or insult with
insult, but with blessing, because to this
you were called so that you may inherit
a blessing.
10For, "Whoever would love life and see
good days must keep his tongue from
evil and his lips from deceitful speech.
11He must turn from evil and do good;
he must seek peace and pursue it.
12For the eyes of the Lord are on the
righteous and his ears are attentive to
their prayer, but the face of the Lord is
against those who do evil."
13Who is going to harm you if you are
eager to do good?
14But even if you should suffer for what
is right, you are blessed. "Do not fear
what they fear ; do not be frightened."
15But in your hearts set apart Christ as
Lord. Always be prepared to give an
answer to everyone who asks you to
give the reason for the hope that you
have. But do this with gentleness and
respect,
16keeping a clear conscience, so that
those who speak maliciously against
your good behavior in Christ may be
ashamed of their slander.
17It is better, if it is God's will, to suffer
for doing good than for doing evil.
18For Christ died for sins once for all, the
righteous for the unrighteous, to bring
you to God. He was put to death in the
body but made alive by the Spirit,
19through whom also he went and
preached to the spirits in prison
20who disobeyed long ago when God
waited patiently in the days of Noah
while the ark was being built. In it only a
few people, eight in all, were saved
through water,
21and this water symbolizes baptism that
now saves you also--not the removal of
dirt from the body but the pledge of a
good conscience toward God. It saves
you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
22who has gone into heaven and is at
God's right hand--with angels,
authorities and powers in submission to
him.
4Therefore, since Christ suffered in his
body, arm yourselves also with the
same attitude, because he who has
suffered in his body is done with sin.
2As a result, he does not live the rest of
his earthly life for evil human desires,
but rather for the will of God.
3For you have spent enough time in the
past doing what pagans choose to do--
living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness,
orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry.
4They think it strange that you do not
plunge with them into the same flood of
dissipation, and they heap abuse on you.
5But they will have to give account to
him who is ready to judge the living and
the dead.
6For this is the reason the gospel was
preached even to those who are now
dead, so that they might be judged
according to men in regard to the body,
but live according to God in regard to
the spirit.
7The end of all things is near. Therefore
be clear minded and self-controlled so
that you can pray.
8Above all, love each other deeply,
because love covers over a multitude of
sins.
9Offer hospitality to one another without
grumbling.
10Each one should use whatever gift he
has received to serve others, faithfully
administering God's grace in its various
forms.
11If anyone speaks, he should do it as
one speaking the very words of God. If
anyone serves, he should do it with the
strength God provides, so that in all
things God may be praised through
Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and
the power for ever and ever. Amen.
12Dear friends, do not be surprised at
the painful trial you are suffering, as
though something strange were
happening to you.
13But rejoice that you participate in the
sufferings of Christ, so that you may be
overjoyed when his glory is revealed.
14If you are insulted because of the
name of Christ, you are blessed, for the
Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
15If you suffer, it should not be as a
murderer or thief or any other kind of
criminal, or even as a meddler.
16However, if you suffer as a Christian,
do not be ashamed, but praise God that
you bear that name.
17For it is time for judgment to begin with
the family of God; and if it begins with us,
what will the outcome be for those who
do not obey the gospel of God?
18And, "If it is hard for the righteous to
be saved, what will become of the
ungodly and the sinner?"
19So then, those who suffer according to
God's will should commit themselves to
their faithful Creator and continue to do
good.
5To the elders among you, I appeal as
a fellow elder, a witness of Christ's
sufferings and one who also will share in
the glory to be revealed:
2Be shepherds of God's flock that is
under your care, serving as overseers--
not because you must, but because you
are willing, as God wants you to be; not
greedy for money, but eager to serve;
3not lording it over those entrusted to
you, but being examples to the flock.
4And when the Chief Shepherd appears,
you will receive the crown of glory that
will never fade away.
5Young men, in the same way be
submissive to those who are older. All of
you, clothe yourselves with humility
toward one another, because, "God
opposes the proud but gives grace to
the humble."
6Humble yourselves, therefore, under
God's mighty hand, that he may lift you
up in due time.
7Cast all your anxiety on him because
he cares for you.
8Be self-controlled and alert. Your
enemy the devil prowls around like a
roaring lion looking for someone to
devour.
9Resist him, standing firm in the faith,
because you know that your brothers
throughout the world are undergoing the
same kind of sufferings.
10And the God of all grace, who called
you to his eternal glory in Christ, after
you have suffered a little while, will
himself restore you and make you
strong, firm and steadfast.
11To him be the power for ever and ever.
Amen.
12With the help of Silas, whom I regard
as a faithful brother, I have written to
you briefly, encouraging you and
testifying that this is the true grace of
God. Stand fast in it.
13She who is in Babylon, chosen
together with you, sends you her
greetings, and so does my son Mark.
14Greet one another with a kiss of love.
Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
2nd Peter
1Simon Peter, a servant and apostle
of Jesus Christ, To those who through
the righteousness of our God and Savior
Jesus Christ have received a faith as
precious as ours:
2Grace and peace be yours in
abundance through the knowledge of
God and of Jesus our Lord.
3His divine power has given us
everything we need for life and
godliness through our knowledge of him
who called us by his own glory and
goodness.
4Through these he has given us his very
great and precious promises, so that
through them you may participate in the
divine nature and escape the corruption
in the world caused by evil desires.
5For this very reason, make every effort
to add to your faith goodness; and to
goodness, knowledge;
6and to knowledge, self-control; and to
self-control, perseverance; and to
perseverance, godliness;
7and to godliness, brotherly kindness;
and to brotherly kindness, love.
8For if you possess these qualities in
increasing measure, they will keep you
from being ineffective and unproductive
in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus
Christ.
9But if anyone does not have them, he is
nearsighted and blind, and has forgotten
that he has been cleansed from his past
sins.
10Therefore, my brothers, be all the
more eager to make your calling and
election sure. For if you do these things,
you will never fall,
11and you will receive a rich welcome
into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ.
12So I will always remind you of these
things, even though you know them and
are firmly established in the truth you
now have.
13I think it is right to refresh your
memory as long as I live in the tent of
this body,
14because I know that I will soon put it
aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has
made clear to me.
15And I will make every effort to see that
after my departure you will always be
able to remember these things.
16We did not follow cleverly invented
stories when we told you about the
power and coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his
majesty.
17For he received honor and glory from
God the Father when the voice came to
him from the Majestic Glory, saying,
"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I
am well pleased."
18We ourselves heard this voice that
came from heaven when we were with
him on the sacred mountain.
19And we have the word of the prophets
made more certain, and you will do well
to pay attention to it, as to a light shining
in a dark place, until the day dawns and
the morning star rises in your hearts.
20Above all, you must understand that
no prophecy of Scripture came about by
the prophet's own interpretation.
21For prophecy never had its origin in
the will of man, but men spoke from God
as they were carried along by the Holy
Spirit.
2But there were also false prophets
among the people, just as there will be
false teachers among you. They will
secretly introduce destructive heresies,
even denying the sovereign Lord who
bought them--bringing swift destruction
on themselves.
2Many will follow their shameful ways
and will bring the way of truth into
disrepute.
3In their greed these teachers will exploit
you with stories they have made up.
Their condemnation has long been
hanging over them, and their destruction
has not been sleeping.
4For if God did not spare angels when
they sinned, but sent them to hell,
putting them into gloomy dungeons to
be held for judgment;
5if he did not spare the ancient world
when he brought the flood on its
ungodly people, but protected Noah, a
preacher of righteousness, and seven
others;
6if he condemned the cities of Sodom
and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes,
and made them an example of what is
going to happen to the ungodly;
7and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man,
who was distressed by the filthy lives of
lawless men
8(for that righteous man, living among
them day after day, was tormented in
his righteous soul by the lawless deeds
he saw and heard)--
9if this is so, then the Lord knows how to
rescue godly men from trials and to hold
the unrighteous for the day of judgment,
while continuing their punishment.
10This is especially true of those who
follow the corrupt desire of the sinful
nature and despise authority.
11Bold and arrogant, these men are not
afraid to slander celestial beings; yet
even angels, although they are stronger
and more powerful, do not bring
slanderous accusations against such
beings in the presence of the Lord.
12But these men blaspheme in matters
they do not understand. They are like
brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born
only to be caught and destroyed, and
like beasts they too will perish.
13They will be paid back with harm for
the harm they have done. Their idea of
pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight.
They are blots and blemishes, reveling
in their pleasures while they feast with
you.
14With eyes full of adultery, they never
stop sinning; they seduce the unstable;
they are experts in greed--an accursed
brood!
15They have left the straight way and
wandered off to follow the way of
Balaam son of Beor, who loved the
wages of wickedness.
16But he was rebuked for his
wrongdoing by a donkey--a beast
without speech--who spoke with a man's
voice and restrained the prophet's
madness.
17These men are springs without water
and mists driven by a storm. Blackest
darkness is reserved for them.
18For they mouth empty, boastful words
and, by appealing to the lustful desires
of sinful human nature, they entice
people who are just escaping from those
who live in error.
19They promise them freedom, while
they themselves are slaves of depravity-
-for a man is a slave to whatever has
mastered him.
20If they have escaped the corruption of
the world by knowing our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ and are again
entangled in it and overcome, they are
worse off at the end than they were at
the beginning.
21It would have been better for them not
to have known the way of righteousness,
than to have known it and then to turn
their backs on the sacred command that
was passed on to them.
22Of them the proverbs are true: "A dog
returns to its vomit," and, "A sow that is
washed goes back to her wallowing in
the mud."
3Dear friends, this is now my second
letter to you. I have written both of them
as reminders to stimulate you to
wholesome thinking.
2I want you to recall the words spoken in
the past by the holy prophets and the
command given by our Lord and Savior
through your apostles.
3First of all, you must understand that in
the last days scoffers will come, scoffing
and following their own evil desires.
4They will say, "Where is this 'coming'
he promised? Ever since our fathers
died, everything goes on as it has since
the beginning of creation."
5But they deliberately forget that long
ago by God's word the heavens existed
and the earth was formed out of water
and by water.
6By these waters also the world of that
time was deluged and destroyed.
7By the same word the present heavens
and earth are reserved for fire, being
kept for the day of judgment and
destruction of ungodly men.
8But do not forget this one thing, dear
friends: With the Lord a day is like a
thousand years, and a thousand years
are like a day.
9The Lord is not slow in keeping his
promise, as some understand slowness.
He is patient with you, not wanting
anyone to perish, but everyone to come
to repentance.
10But the day of the Lord will come like a
thief. The heavens will disappear with a
roar; the elements will be destroyed by
fire, and the earth and everything in it
will be laid bare.
11Since everything will be destroyed in
this way, what kind of people ought you
to be? You ought to live holy and godly
lives
12as you look forward to the day of God
and speed its coming. That day will
bring about the destruction of the
heavens by fire, and the elements will
melt in the heat.
13But in keeping with his promise we are
looking forward to a new heaven and a
new earth, the home of righteousness.
14So then, dear friends, since you are
looking forward to this, make every
effort to be found spotless, blameless
and at peace with him.
15Bear in mind that our Lord's patience
means salvation, just as our dear
brother Paul also wrote you with the
wisdom that God gave him.
16He writes the same way in all his
letters, speaking in them of these
matters. His letters contain some things
that are hard to understand, which
ignorant and unstable people distort, as
they do the other Scriptures, to their
own destruction.
17Therefore, dear friends, since you
already know this, be on your guard so
that you may not be carried away by the
error of lawless men and fall from your
secure position.
18But grow in the grace and knowledge
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To
him be glory both now and forever!
Amen.
1st John
1That which was from the beginning,
which we have heard, which we have
seen with our eyes, which we have
looked at and our hands have touched--
this we proclaim concerning the Word of
life.
2The life appeared; we have seen it and
testify to it, and we proclaim to you the
eternal life, which was with the Father
and has appeared to us.
3We proclaim to you what we have seen
and heard, so that you also may have
fellowship with us. And our fellowship is
with the Father and with his Son, Jesus
Christ.
4We write this to make our joy complete.
5This is the message we have heard
from him and declare to you: God is
light; in him there is no darkness at all.
6If we claim to have fellowship with him
yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do
not live by the truth.
7But if we walk in the light, as he is in
the light, we have fellowship with one
another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son,
purifies us from all sin.
8If we claim to be without sin, we
deceive ourselves and the truth is not in
us.
9If we confess our sins, he is faithful and
just and will forgive us our sins and
purify us from all unrighteousness.
10If we claim we have not sinned, we
make him out to be a liar and his word
has no place in our lives.
2My dear children, I write this to you
so that you will not sin. But if anybody
does sin, we have one who speaks to
the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ,
the Righteous One.
2He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins,
and not only for ours but also for the
sins of the whole world.
3We know that we have come to know
him if we obey his commands.
4The man who says, "I know him," but
does not do what he commands is a liar,
and the truth is not in him.
5But if anyone obeys his word, God's
love is truly made complete in him. This
is how we know we are in him:
6Whoever claims to live in him must
walk as Jesus did.
7Dear friends, I am not writing you a new
command but an old one, which you
have had since the beginning. This old
command is the message you have
heard.
8Yet I am writing you a new command;
its truth is seen in him and you, because
the darkness is passing and the true
light is already shining.
9Anyone who claims to be in the light but
hates his brother is still in the darkness.
10Whoever loves his brother lives in the
light, and there is nothing in him to make
him stumble.
11But whoever hates his brother is in the
darkness and walks around in the
darkness; he does not know where he is
going, because the darkness has
blinded him.
12I write to you, dear children, because
your sins have been forgiven on account
of his name.
13I write to you, fathers, because you
have known him who is from the
beginning. I write to you, young men,
because you have overcome the evil
one. I write to you, dear children,
because you have known the Father.
14I write to you, fathers, because you
have known him who is from the
beginning. I write to you, young men,
because you are strong, and the word of
God lives in you, and you have
overcome the evil one.
15Do not love the world or anything in
the world. If anyone loves the world, the
love of the Father is not in him.
16For everything in the world--the
cravings of sinful man, the lust of his
eyes and the boasting of what he has
and does--comes not from the Father
but from the world.
17The world and its desires pass away,
but the man who does the will of God
lives forever.
18Dear children, this is the last hour; and
as you have heard that the antichrist is
coming, even now many antichrists
have come. This is how we know it is
the last hour.
19They went out from us, but they did
not really belong to us. For if they had
belonged to us, they would have
remained with us; but their going
showed that none of them belonged to
us.
20But you have an anointing from the
Holy One, and all of you know the truth.
21I do not write to you because you do
not know the truth, but because you do
know it and because no lie comes from
the truth.
22Who is the liar? It is the man who
denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a
man is the antichrist--he denies the
Father and the Son.
23No one who denies the Son has the
Father; whoever acknowledges the Son
has the Father also.
24See that what you have heard from the
beginning remains in you. If it does, you
also will remain in the Son and in the
Father.
25And this is what he promised us--even
eternal life.
26I am writing these things to you about
those who are trying to lead you astray.
27As for you, the anointing you received
from him remains in you, and you do not
need anyone to teach you. But as his
anointing teaches you about all things
and as that anointing is real, not
counterfeit--just as it has taught you,
remain in him.
28And now, dear children, continue in
him, so that when he appears we may
be confident and unashamed before him
at his coming.
29If you know that he is righteous, you
know that everyone who does what is
right has been born of him.
3How great is the love the Father has
lavished on us, that we should be called
children of God! And that is what we
are! The reason the world does not
know us is that it did not know him.
2Dear friends, now we are children of
God, and what we will be has not yet
been made known. But we know that
when he appears, we shall be like him,
for we shall see him as he is.
3Everyone who has this hope in him
purifies himself, just as he is pure.
4Everyone who sins breaks the law; in
fact, sin is lawlessness.
5But you know that he appeared so that
he might take away our sins. And in him
is no sin.
6No one who lives in him keeps on
sinning. No one who continues to sin
has either seen him or known him.
7Dear children, do not let anyone lead
you astray. He who does what is right is
righteous, just as he is righteous.
8He who does what is sinful is of the
devil, because the devil has been
sinning from the beginning. The reason
the Son of God appeared was to destroy
the devil's work.
9No one who is born of God will continue
to sin, because God's seed remains in
him; he cannot go on sinning, because
he has been born of God.
10This is how we know who the children
of God are and who the children of the
devil are: Anyone who does not do what
is right is not a child of God; nor is
anyone who does not love his brother.
11This is the message you heard from
the beginning: We should love one
another.
12Do not be like Cain, who belonged to
the evil one and murdered his brother.
And why did he murder him? Because
his own actions were evil and his
brother's were righteous.
13Do not be surprised, my brothers, if
the world hates you.
14We know that we have passed from
death to life, because we love our
brothers. Anyone who does not love
remains in death.
15Anyone who hates his brother is a
murderer, and you know that no
murderer has eternal life in him.
16This is how we know what love is:
Jesus Christ laid down his life for us.
And we ought to lay down our lives for
our brothers.
17If anyone has material possessions
and sees his brother in need but has no
pity on him, how can the love of God be
in him?
18Dear children, let us not love with
words or tongue but with actions and in
truth.
19This then is how we know that we
belong to the truth, and how we set our
hearts at rest in his presence
20whenever our hearts condemn us. For
God is greater than our hearts, and he
knows everything.
21Dear friends, if our hearts do not
condemn us, we have confidence before
God
22and receive from him anything we ask,
because we obey his commands and do
what pleases him.
23And this is his command: to believe in
the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and
to love one another as he commanded
us.
24Those who obey his commands live in
him, and he in them. And this is how we
know that he lives in us: We know it by
the Spirit he gave us.
4Dear friends, do not believe every
spirit, but test the spirits to see whether
they are from God, because many false
prophets have gone out into the world.
2This is how you can recognize the Spirit
of God: Every spirit that acknowledges
that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
is from God,
3but every spirit that does not
acknowledge Jesus is not from God.
This is the spirit of the antichrist, which
you have heard is coming and even now
is already in the world.
4You, dear children, are from God and
have overcome them, because the one
who is in you is greater than the one
who is in the world.
5They are from the world and therefore
speak from the viewpoint of the world,
and the world listens to them.
6We are from God, and whoever knows
God listens to us; but whoever is not
from God does not listen to us. This is
how we recognize the Spirit of truth and
the spirit of falsehood.
7Dear friends, let us love one another,
for love comes from God. Everyone who
loves has been born of God and knows
God.
8Whoever does not love does not know
God, because God is love.
9This is how God showed his love
among us: He sent his one and only
Son into the world that we might live
through him.
10This is love: not that we loved God, but
that he loved us and sent his Son as an
atoning sacrifice for our sins.
11Dear friends, since God so loved us,
we also ought to love one another.
12No one has ever seen God; but if we
love one another, God lives in us and
his love is made complete in us.
13We know that we live in him and he in
us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
14And we have seen and testify that the
Father has sent his Son to be the Savior
of the world.
15If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is
the Son of God, God lives in him and he
in God.
16And so we know and rely on the love
God has for us. God is love. Whoever
lives in love lives in God, and God in
him.
17In this way, love is made complete
among us so that we will have
confidence on the day of judgment,
because in this world we are like him.
18There is no fear in love. But perfect
love drives out fear, because fear has to
do with punishment. The one who fears
is not made perfect in love.
19We love because he first loved us.
20If anyone says, "I love God," yet hates
his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who
does not love his brother, whom he has
seen, cannot love God, whom he has
not seen.
21And he has given us this command:
Whoever loves God must also love his
brother.
5Everyone who believes that Jesus is
the Christ is born of God, and everyone
who loves the father loves his child as
well.
2This is how we know that we love the
children of God: by loving God and
carrying out his commands.
3This is love for God: to obey his
commands. And his commands are not
burdensome,
4for everyone born of God overcomes
the world. This is the victory that has
overcome the world, even our faith.
5Who is it that overcomes the world?
Only he who believes that Jesus is the
Son of God.
6This is the one who came by water and
blood--Jesus Christ. He did not come by
water only, but by water and blood. And
it is the Spirit who testifies, because the
Spirit is the truth.
7For there are three that testify:
8the Spirit, the water and the blood; and
the three are in agreement.
9We accept man's testimony, but God's
testimony is greater because it is the
testimony of God, which he has given
about his Son.
10Anyone who believes in the Son of
God has this testimony in his heart.
Anyone who does not believe God has
made him out to be a liar, because he
has not believed the testimony God has
given about his Son.
11And this is the testimony: God has
given us eternal life, and this life is in his
Son.
12He who has the Son has life; he who
does not have the Son of God does not
have life.
13I write these things to you who believe
in the name of the Son of God so that
you may know that you have eternal life.
14This is the confidence we have in
approaching God: that if we ask
anything according to his will, he hears
us.
15And if we know that he hears us--
whatever we ask--we know that we have
what we asked of him.
16If anyone sees his brother commit a
sin that does not lead to death, he
should pray and God will give him life. I
refer to those whose sin does not lead
to death. There is a sin that leads to
death. I am not saying that he should
pray about that.
17All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin
that does not lead to death.
18We know that anyone born of God
does not continue to sin; the one who
was born of God keeps him safe, and
the evil one cannot harm him.
19We know that we are children of God,
and that the whole world is under the
control of the evil one.
20We know also that the Son of God has
come and has given us understanding,
so that we may know him who is true.
And we are in him who is true--even in
his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God
and eternal life.
21Dear children, keep yourselves from
idols.
2nd John
1The elder,
2To the chosen lady and her children,
whom I love in the truth--and not I only,
but also all who know the truth--
because of the truth, which lives in us
and will be with us forever:
3Grace, mercy and peace from God the
Father and from Jesus Christ, the
Father's Son, will be with us in truth and
love.
4It has given me great joy to find some
of your children walking in the truth, just
as the Father commanded us.
5And now, dear lady, I am not writing
you a new command but one we have
had from the beginning. I ask that we
love one another.
6And this is love: that we walk in
obedience to his commands. As you
have heard from the beginning, his
command is that you walk in love.
7Many deceivers, who do not
acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in
the flesh, have gone out into the world.
Any such person is the deceiver and the
antichrist.
8Watch out that you do not lose what
you have worked for, but that you may
be rewarded fully.
9Anyone who runs ahead and does not
continue in the teaching of Christ does
not have God; whoever continues in the
teaching has both the Father and the
Son.
10If anyone comes to you and does not
bring this teaching, do not take him into
your house or welcome him.
11Anyone who welcomes him shares in
his wicked work.
12I have much to write to you, but I do
not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I
hope to visit you and talk with you face
to face, so that our joy may be complete.
13The children of your chosen sister
send their greetings.
3rd John
1The elder, To my dear friend Gaius,
whom I love in the truth.
2Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy
good health and that all may go well
with you, even as your soul is getting
along well.
3It gave me great joy to have some
brothers come and tell about your
faithfulness to the truth and how you
continue to walk in the truth.
4I have no greater joy than to hear that
my children are walking in the truth.
5Dear friend, you are faithful in what you
are doing for the brothers, even though
they are strangers to you.
6They have told the church about your
love. You will do well to send them on
their way in a manner worthy of God.
7It was for the sake of the Name that
they went out, receiving no help from
the pagans.
8We ought therefore to show hospitality
to such men so that we may work
together for the truth.
9I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes,
who loves to be first, will have nothing to
do with us.
10So if I come, I will call attention to what
he is doing, gossiping maliciously about
us. Not satisfied with that, he refuses to
welcome the brothers. He also stops
those who want to do so and puts them
out of the church.
11Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil
but what is good. Anyone who does
what is good is from God. Anyone who
does what is evil has not seen God.
12Demetrius is well spoken of by
everyone--and even by the truth itself.
We also speak well of him, and you
know that our testimony is true.
13I have much to write you, but I do not
want to do so with pen and ink.
14I hope to see you soon, and we will
talk face to face. Peace to you. The
friends here send their greetings. Greet
the friends there by name.
Jude
1Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a
brother of James, To those who have
been called, who are loved by God the
Father and kept by Jesus Christ:
2Mercy, peace and love be yours in
abundance.
3Dear friends, although I was very eager
to write to you about the salvation we
share, I felt I had to write and urge you
to contend for the faith that was once for
all entrusted to the saints.
4For certain men whose condemnation
was written about long ago have
secretly slipped in among you. They are
godless men, who change the grace of
our God into a license for immorality and
deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign
and Lord.
5Though you already know all this, I
want to remind you that the Lord
delivered his people out of Egypt, but
later destroyed those who did not
believe.
6And the angels who did not keep their
positions of authority but abandoned
their own home--these he has kept in
darkness, bound with everlasting chains
for judgment on the great Day.
7In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah
and the surrounding towns gave
themselves up to sexual immorality and
perversion. They serve as an example
of those who suffer the punishment of
eternal fire.
8In the very same way, these dreamers
pollute their own bodies, reject authority
and slander celestial beings.
9But even the archangel Michael, when
he was disputing with the devil about the
body of Moses, did not dare to bring a
slanderous accusation against him, but
said, "The Lord rebuke you!"
10Yet these men speak abusively
against whatever they do not
understand; and what things they do
understand by instinct, like unreasoning
animals--these are the very things that
destroy them.
11Woe to them! They have taken the
way of Cain; they have rushed for profit
into Balaam's error; they have been
destroyed in Korah's rebellion.
12These men are blemishes at your love
feasts, eating with you without the
slightest qualm--shepherds who feed
only themselves. They are clouds
without rain, blown along by the wind;
autumn trees, without fruit and
uprooted--twice dead.
13They are wild waves of the sea,
foaming up their shame; wandering
stars, for whom blackest darkness has
been reserved forever.
14Enoch, the seventh from Adam,
prophesied about these men: "See, the
Lord is coming with thousands upon
thousands of his holy ones
15to judge everyone, and to convict all
the ungodly of all the ungodly acts they
have done in the ungodly way, and of all
the harsh words ungodly sinners have
spoken against him."
16These men are grumblers and
faultfinders; they follow their own evil
desires; they boast about themselves
and flatter others for their own
advantage.
17But, dear friends, remember what the
apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ
foretold.
18They said to you, "In the last times
there will be scoffers who will follow their
own ungodly desires."
19These are the men who divide you,
who follow mere natural instincts and do
not have the Spirit.
20But you, dear friends, build yourselves
up in your most holy faith and pray in
the Holy Spirit.
21Keep yourselves in God's love as you
wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
Christ to bring you to eternal life.
22Be merciful to those who doubt;
23snatch others from the fire and save
them; to others show mercy, mixed with
fear--hating even the clothing stained by
corrupted flesh.
24To him who is able to keep you from
falling and to present you before his
glorious presence without fault and with
great joy--
25to the only God our Savior be glory,
majesty, power and authority, through
Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages,
now and forevermore! Amen.
Revelation
1The revelation of Jesus Christ, which
God gave him to show his servants what
must soon take place. He made it
known by sending his angel to his
servant John,
2who testifies to everything he saw--that
is, the word of God and the testimony of
Jesus Christ.
3Blessed is the one who reads the
words of this prophecy, and blessed are
those who hear it and take to heart what
is written in it, because the time is near.
4John, To the seven churches in the
province of Asia: Grace and peace to
you from him who is, and who was, and
who is to come, and from the seven
spirits
5before his throne, and from Jesus
Christ, who is the faithful witness, the
firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of
the kings of the earth.
6To him who loves us and has freed us
from our sins by his blood, and has
made us to be a kingdom and priests to
serve his God and Father--to him be
glory and power for ever and ever!
Amen.
7Look, he is coming with the clouds, and
every eye will see him, even those who
pierced him; and all the peoples of the
earth will mourn because of him. So
shall it be! Amen.
8"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says
the Lord God, "who is, and who was,
and who is to come, the Almighty."
9I, John, your brother and companion in
the suffering and kingdom and patient
endurance that are ours in Jesus, was
on the island of Patmos because of the
word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
10On the Lord's Day I was in the Spirit,
and I heard behind me a loud voice like
a trumpet,
11which said: "Write on a scroll what you
see and send it to the seven churches:
to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum,
Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and
Laodicea."
12I turned around to see the voice that
was speaking to me. And when I turned
I saw seven golden lampstands,
13and among the lampstands was
someone "like a son of man," dressed in
a robe reaching down to his feet and
with a golden sash around his chest.
14His head and hair were white like wool,
as white as snow, and his eyes were
like blazing fire.
15His feet were like bronze glowing in a
furnace, and his voice was like the
sound of rushing waters.
16In his right hand he held seven stars,
and out of his mouth came a sharp
double-edged sword. His face was like
the sun shining in all its brilliance.
17When I saw him, I fell at his feet as
though dead. Then he placed his right
hand on me and said: "Do not be afraid.
I am the First and the Last.
18I am the Living One; I was dead, and
behold I am alive for ever and ever! And
I hold the keys of death and Hades.
19"Write, therefore, what you have seen,
what is now and what will take place
later.
20The mystery of the seven stars that
you saw in my right hand and of the
seven golden lampstands is this: The
seven stars are the angels of the seven
churches, and the seven lampstands
are the seven churches.
2"To the angel of the church in
Ephesus write: These are the words of
him who holds the seven stars in his
right hand and walks among the seven
golden lampstands:
2I know your deeds, your hard work and
your perseverance. I know that you
cannot tolerate wicked men, that you
have tested those who claim to be
apostles but are not, and have found
them false.
3You have persevered and have
endured hardships for my name, and
have not grown weary.
4Yet I hold this against you: You have
forsaken your first love.
5Remember the height from which you
have fallen! Repent and do the things
you did at first. If you do not repent, I will
come to you and remove your
lampstand from its place.
6But you have this in your favor: You
hate the practices of the Nicolaitans,
which I also hate.
7He who has an ear, let him hear what
the Spirit says to the churches. To him
who overcomes, I will give the right to
eat from the tree of life, which is in the
paradise of God.
8"To the angel of the church in Smyrna
write: These are the words of him who is
the First and the Last, who died and
came to life again.
9I know your afflictions and your povertyyet
you are rich! I know the slander of
those who say they are Jews and are
not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
10Do not be afraid of what you are about
to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put
some of you in prison to test you, and
you will suffer persecution for ten days.
Be faithful, even to the point of death,
and I will give you the crown of life.
11He who has an ear, let him hear what
the Spirit says to the churches. He who
overcomes will not be hurt at all by the
second death.
12"To the angel of the church in
Pergamum write: These are the words
of him who has the sharp, doubleedged
sword.
13I know where you live-where Satan
has his throne. Yet you remain true to
my name. You did not renounce your
faith in me, even in the days of Antipas,
my faithful witness, who was put to
death in your city-where Satan lives.
14Nevertheless, I have a few things
against you: You have people there who
hold to the teaching of Balaam, who
taught Balak to entice the Israelites to
sin by eating food sacrificed to idols and
by committing sexual immorality.
15Likewise you also have those who
hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
16Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will
soon come to you and will fight against
them with the sword of my mouth.
17He who has an ear, let him hear what
the Spirit says to the churches. To him
who overcomes, I will give some of the
hidden manna. I will also give him a
white stone with a new name written on
it, known only to him who receives it.
18"To the angel of the church in Thyatira
write: These are the words of the Son of
God, whose eyes are like blazing fire
and whose feet are like burnished
bronze.
19I know your deeds, your love and faith,
your service and perseverance, and that
you are now doing more than you did at
first.
20Nevertheless, I have this against you:
You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who
calls herself a prophetess. By her
teaching she misleads my servants into
sexual immorality and the eating of food
sacrificed to idols.
21I have given her time to repent of her
immorality, but she is unwilling.
22So I will cast her on a bed of suffering,
and I will make those who commit
adultery with her suffer intensely, unless
they repent of her ways.
23I will strike her children dead. Then all
the churches will know that I am he who
searches hearts and minds, and I will
repay each of you according to your
deeds.
24Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira,
to you who do not hold to her teaching
and have not learned Satan's so-called
deep secrets (I will not impose any other
burden on you):
25Only hold on to what you have until I
come.
26To him who overcomes and does my
will to the end, I will give authority over
the nations--
27'He will rule them with an iron scepter;
he will dash them to pieces like pottery' -
-
28just as I have received authority from
my Father. I will also give him the
morning star.
29He who has an ear, let him hear what
the Spirit says to the churches.
3"To the angel of the church in Sardis
write: These are the words of him who
holds the seven spirits of God and the
seven stars. I know your deeds; you
have a reputation of being alive, but you
are dead.
2Wake up! Strengthen what remains and
is about to die, for I have not found your
deeds complete in the sight of my God.
3Remember, therefore, what you have
received and heard; obey it, and repent.
But if you do not wake up, I will come
like a thief, and you will not know at
what time I will come to you.
4Yet you have a few people in Sardis
who have not soiled their clothes. They
will walk with me, dressed in white, for
they are worthy.
5He who overcomes will, like them, be
dressed in white. I will never blot out his
name from the book of life, but will
acknowledge his name before my
Father and his angels.
6He who has an ear, let him hear what
the Spirit says to the churches.
7"To the angel of the church in
Philadelphia write: These are the words
of him who is holy and true, who holds
the key of David. What he opens no one
can shut, and what he shuts no one can
open.
8I know your deeds. See, I have placed
before you an open door that no one
can shut. I know that you have little
strength, yet you have kept my word
and have not denied my name.
9I will make those who are of the
synagogue of Satan, who claim to be
Jews though they are not, but are liars--I
will make them come and fall down at
your feet and acknowledge that I have
loved you.
10Since you have kept my command to
endure patiently, I will also keep you
from the hour of trial that is going to
come upon the whole world to test those
who live on the earth.
11I am coming soon. Hold on to what
you have, so that no one will take your
crown.
12Him who overcomes I will make a pillar
in the temple of my God. Never again
will he leave it. I will write on him the
name of my God and the name of the
city of my God, the new Jerusalem,
which is coming down out of heaven
from my God; and I will also write on
him my new name.
13He who has an ear, let him hear what
the Spirit says to the churches.
14"To the angel of the church in
Laodicea write: These are the words of
the Amen, the faithful and true witness,
the ruler of God's creation.
15I know your deeds, that you are
neither cold nor hot. I wish you were
either one or the other!
16So, because you are lukewarm--
neither hot nor cold--I am about to spit
you out of my mouth.
17You say, 'I am rich; I have acquired
wealth and do not need a thing.' But you
do not realize that you are wretched,
pitiful, poor, blind and naked.
18I counsel you to buy from me gold
refined in the fire, so you can become
rich; and white clothes to wear, so you
can cover your shameful nakedness;
and salve to put on your eyes, so you
can see.
19Those whom I love I rebuke and
discipline. So be earnest, and repent.
20Here I am! I stand at the door and
knock. If anyone hears my voice and
opens the door, I will come in and eat
with him, and he with me.
21To him who overcomes, I will give the
right to sit with me on my throne, just as
I overcame and sat down with my
Father on his throne.
22He who has an ear, let him hear what
the Spirit says to the churches."
4After this I looked, and there before
me was a door standing open in heaven.
And the voice I had first heard speaking
to me like a trumpet said, "Come up
here, and I will show you what must take
place after this."
2At once I was in the Spirit, and there
before me was a throne in heaven with
someone sitting on it.
3And the one who sat there had the
appearance of jasper and carnelian. A
rainbow, resembling an emerald,
encircled the throne.
4Surrounding the throne were twentyfour
other thrones, and seated on them
were twenty-four elders. They were
dressed in white and had crowns of gold
on their heads.
5From the throne came flashes of
lightning, rumblings and peals of
thunder. Before the throne, seven lamps
were blazing. These are the seven
spirits of God.
6Also before the throne there was what
looked like a sea of glass, clear as
crystal.
7In the center, around the throne, were
four living creatures, and they were
covered with eyes, in front and in back.
The first living creature was like a lion,
the second was like an ox, the third had
a face like a man, the fourth was like a
flying eagle.
8Each of the four living creatures had six
wings and was covered with eyes all
around, even under his wings. Day and
night they never stop saying: "Holy, holy,
holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was,
and is, and is to come."
9Whenever the living creatures give
glory, honor and thanks to him who sits
on the throne and who lives for ever and
ever,
10the twenty-four elders fall down before
him who sits on the throne, and worship
him who lives for ever and ever. They
lay their crowns before the throne and
say:
11"You are worthy, our Lord and God, to
receive glory and honor and power, for
you created all things, and by your will
they were created and have their being."
5Then I saw in the right hand of him
who sat on the throne a scroll with
writing on both sides and sealed with
seven seals.
2And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in
a loud voice, "Who is worthy to break
the seals and open the scroll?"
3But no one in heaven or on earth or
under the earth could open the scroll or
even look inside it.
4I wept and wept because no one was
found who was worthy to open the scroll
or look inside.
5Then one of the elders said to me, "Do
not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of
Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed.
He is able to open the scroll and its
seven seals."
6Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had
been slain, standing in the center of the
throne, encircled by the four living
creatures and the elders. He had seven
horns and seven eyes, which are the
seven spirits of God sent out into all the
earth.
7He came and took the scroll from the
right hand of him who sat on the throne.
8And when he had taken it, the four
living creatures and the twenty-four
elders fell down before the Lamb. Each
one had a harp and they were holding
golden bowls full of incense, which are
the prayers of the saints.
9And they sang a new song: "You are
worthy to take the scroll and to open its
seals, because you were slain, and with
your blood you purchased men for God
from every tribe and language and
people and nation.
10You have made them to be a kingdom
and priests to serve our God, and they
will reign on the earth."
11Then I looked and heard the voice of
many angels, numbering thousands
upon thousands, and ten thousand
times ten thousand. They encircled the
throne and the living creatures and the
elders.
12In a loud voice they sang: "Worthy is
the Lamb, who was slain, to receive
power and wealth and wisdom and
strength and honor and glory and
praise!"
13Then I heard every creature in heaven
and on earth and under the earth and on
the sea, and all that is in them, singing:
"To him who sits on the throne and to
the Lamb be praise and honor and glory
and power, for ever and ever!"
14The four living creatures said, "Amen,"
and the elders fell down and worshiped.
6I watched as the Lamb opened the
first of the seven seals. Then I heard
one of the four living creatures say in a
voice like thunder, "Come!"
2I looked, and there before me was a
white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he
was given a crown, and he rode out as a
conqueror bent on conquest.
3When the Lamb opened the second
seal, I heard the second living creature
say, "Come!"
4Then another horse came out, a fiery
red one. Its rider was given power to
take peace from the earth and to make
men slay each other. To him was given
a large sword.
5When the Lamb opened the third seal, I
heard the third living creature say,
"Come!" I looked, and there before me
was a black horse! Its rider was holding
a pair of scales in his hand.
6Then I heard what sounded like a voice
among the four living creatures, saying,
"A quart of wheat for a day's wages, and
three quarts of barley for a day's wages,
and do not damage the oil and the
wine!"
7When the Lamb opened the fourth seal,
I heard the voice of the fourth living
creature say, "Come!"
8I looked, and there before me was a
pale horse! Its rider was named Death,
and Hades was following close behind
him. They were given power over a
fourth of the earth to kill by sword,
famine and plague, and by the wild
beasts of the earth.
9When he opened the fifth seal, I saw
under the altar the souls of those who
had been slain because of the word of
God and the testimony they had
maintained.
10They called out in a loud voice, "How
long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until
you judge the inhabitants of the earth
and avenge our blood?"
11Then each of them was given a white
robe, and they were told to wait a little
longer, until the number of their fellow
servants and brothers who were to be
killed as they had been was completed.
12I watched as he opened the sixth seal.
There was a great earthquake. The sun
turned black like sackcloth made of goat
hair, the whole moon turned blood red,
13and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as
late figs drop from a fig tree when
shaken by a strong wind.
14The sky receded like a scroll, rolling up,
and every mountain and island was
removed from its place.
15Then the kings of the earth, the
princes, the generals, the rich, the
mighty, and every slave and every free
man hid in caves and among the rocks
of the mountains.
16They called to the mountains and the
rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the
face of him who sits on the throne and
from the wrath of the Lamb!
17For the great day of their wrath has
come, and who can stand?"
7After this I saw four angels standing
at the four corners of the earth, holding
back the four winds of the earth to
prevent any wind from blowing on the
land or on the sea or on any tree.
2Then I saw another angel coming up
from the east, having the seal of the
living God. He called out in a loud voice
to the four angels who had been given
power to harm the land and the sea:
3"Do not harm the land or the sea or the
trees until we put a seal on the
foreheads of the servants of our God."
4Then I heard the number of those who
were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes
of Israel.
5From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were
sealed, from the tribe of Reuben 12,000,
from the tribe of Gad 12,000,
6from the tribe of Asher 12,000, from the
tribe of Naphtali 12,000, from the tribe of
Manasseh 12,000,
7from the tribe of Simeon 12,000, from
the tribe of Levi 12,000, from the tribe of
Issachar 12,000,
8from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000, from
the tribe of Joseph 12,000, from the
tribe of Benjamin 12,000.
9After this I looked and there before me
was a great multitude that no one could
count, from every nation, tribe, people
and language, standing before the
throne and in front of the Lamb. They
were wearing white robes and were
holding palm branches in their hands.
10And they cried out in a loud voice:
"Salvation belongs to our God, who sits
on the throne, and to the Lamb."
11All the angels were standing around
the throne and around the elders and
the four living creatures. They fell down
on their faces before the throne and
worshiped God,
12saying: "Amen! Praise and glory and
wisdom and thanks and honor and
power and strength be to our God for
ever and ever. Amen!"
13Then one of the elders asked me,
"These in white robes--who are they,
and where did they come from?"
14I answered, "Sir, you know."
15And he said, "These are they who
have come out of the great tribulation;
they have washed their robes and made
them white in the blood of the Lamb.
Therefore, "they are before the throne of
God and serve him day and night in his
temple; and he who sits on the throne
will spread his tent over them.
16Never again will they hunger; never
again will they thirst. The sun will not
beat upon them, nor any scorching heat.
17For the Lamb at the center of the
throne will be their shepherd; he will
lead them to springs of living water. And
God will wipe away every tear from their
eyes."
8When he opened the seventh seal,
there was silence in heaven for about
half an hour.
2And I saw the seven angels who stand
before God, and to them were given
seven trumpets.
3Another angel, who had a golden
censer, came and stood at the altar. He
was given much incense to offer, with
the prayers of all the saints, on the
golden altar before the throne.
4The smoke of the incense, together
with the prayers of the saints, went up
before God from the angel's hand.
5Then the angel took the censer, filled it
with fire from the altar, and hurled it on
the earth; and there came peals of
thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning
and an earthquake.
6Then the seven angels who had the
seven trumpets prepared to sound them.
7The first angel sounded his trumpet,
and there came hail and fire mixed with
blood, and it was hurled down upon the
earth. A third of the earth was burned up,
a third of the trees were burned up, and
all the green grass was burned up.
8The second angel sounded his trumpet,
and something like a huge mountain, all
ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third
of the sea turned into blood,
9a third of the living creatures in the sea
died, and a third of the ships were
destroyed.
10The third angel sounded his trumpet,
and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell
from the sky on a third of the rivers and
on the springs of water--
11the name of the star is Wormwood. A
third of the waters turned bitter, and
many people died from the waters that
had become bitter.
12The fourth angel sounded his trumpet,
and a third of the sun was struck, a third
of the moon, and a third of the stars, so
that a third of them turned dark. A third
of the day was without light, and also a
third of the night.
13As I watched, I heard an eagle that
was flying in midair call out in a loud
voice: "Woe! Woe! Woe to the
inhabitants of the earth, because of the
trumpet blasts about to be sounded by
the other three angels!"
9The fifth angel sounded his trumpet,
and I saw a star that had fallen from the
sky to the earth. The star was given the
key to the shaft of the Abyss.
2When he opened the Abyss, smoke
rose from it like the smoke from a
gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were
darkened by the smoke from the Abyss.
3And out of the smoke locusts came
down upon the earth and were given
power like that of scorpions of the earth.
4They were told not to harm the grass of
the earth or any plant or tree, but only
those people who did not have the seal
of God on their foreheads.
5They were not given power to kill them,
but only to torture them for five months.
And the agony they suffered was like
that of the sting of a scorpion when it
strikes a man.
6During those days men will seek death,
but will not find it; they will long to die,
but death will elude them.
7The locusts looked like horses
prepared for battle. On their heads they
wore something like crowns of gold, and
their faces resembled human faces.
8Their hair was like women's hair, and
their teeth were like lions' teeth.
9They had breastplates like breastplates
of iron, and the sound of their wings was
like the thundering of many horses and
chariots rushing into battle.
10They had tails and stings like
scorpions, and in their tails they had
power to torment people for five months.
11They had as king over them the angel
of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is
Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon.
12The first woe is past; two other woes
are yet to come.
13The sixth angel sounded his trumpet,
and I heard a voice coming from the
horns of the golden altar that is before
God.
14It said to the sixth angel who had the
trumpet, "Release the four angels who
are bound at the great river Euphrates."
15And the four angels who had been
kept ready for this very hour and day
and month and year were released to
kill a third of mankind.
16The number of the mounted troops
was two hundred million. I heard their
number.
17The horses and riders I saw in my
vision looked like this: Their breastplates
were fiery red, dark blue, and yellow as
sulfur. The heads of the horses
resembled the heads of lions, and out of
their mouths came fire, smoke and
sulfur.
18A third of mankind was killed by the
three plagues of fire, smoke and sulfur
that came out of their mouths.
19The power of the horses was in their
mouths and in their tails; for their tails
were like snakes, having heads with
which they inflict injury.
20The rest of mankind that were not
killed by these plagues still did not
repent of the work of their hands; they
did not stop worshiping demons, and
idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone and
wood--idols that cannot see or hear or
walk.
21Nor did they repent of their murders,
their magic arts, their sexual immorality
or their thefts.
10Then I saw another mighty angel
coming down from heaven. He was
robed in a cloud, with a rainbow above
his head; his face was like the sun, and
his legs were like fiery pillars.
2He was holding a little scroll, which lay
open in his hand. He planted his right
foot on the sea and his left foot on the
land,
3and he gave a loud shout like the roar
of a lion. When he shouted, the voices
of the seven thunders spoke.
4And when the seven thunders spoke, I
was about to write; but I heard a voice
from heaven say, "Seal up what the
seven thunders have said and do not
write it down."
5Then the angel I had seen standing on
the sea and on the land raised his right
hand to heaven.
6And he swore by him who lives for ever
and ever, who created the heavens and
all that is in them, the earth and all that
is in it, and the sea and all that is in it,
and said, "There will be no more delay!
7But in the days when the seventh angel
is about to sound his trumpet, the
mystery of God will be accomplished,
just as he announced to his servants the
prophets."
8Then the voice that I had heard from
heaven spoke to me once more: "Go,
take the scroll that lies open in the hand
of the angel who is standing on the sea
and on the land."
9So I went to the angel and asked him to
give me the little scroll. He said to me,
"Take it and eat it. It will turn your
stomach sour, but in your mouth it will
be as sweet as honey."
10I took the little scroll from the angel's
hand and ate it. It tasted as sweet as
honey in my mouth, but when I had
eaten it, my stomach turned sour.
11Then I was told, "You must prophesy
again about many peoples, nations,
languages and kings."
11I was given a reed like a
measuring rod and was told, "Go and
measure the temple of God and the altar,
and count the worshipers there.
2But exclude the outer court; do not
measure it, because it has been given to
the Gentiles. They will trample on the
holy city for 42 months.
3And I will give power to my two
witnesses, and they will prophesy for
1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth."
4These are the two olive trees and the
two lampstands that stand before the
Lord of the earth.
5If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes
from their mouths and devours their
enemies. This is how anyone who wants
to harm them must die.
6These men have power to shut up the
sky so that it will not rain during the time
they are prophesying; and they have
power to turn the waters into blood and
to strike the earth with every kind of
plague as often as they want.
7Now when they have finished their
testimony, the beast that comes up from
the Abyss will attack them, and
overpower and kill them.
8Their bodies will lie in the street of the
great city, which is figuratively called
Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord
was crucified.
9For three and a half days men from
every people, tribe, language and nation
will gaze on their bodies and refuse
them burial.
10The inhabitants of the earth will gloat
over them and will celebrate by sending
each other gifts, because these two
prophets had tormented those who live
on the earth.
11But after the three and a half days a
breath of life from God entered them,
and they stood on their feet, and terror
struck those who saw them.
12Then they heard a loud voice from
heaven saying to them, "Come up here."
And they went up to heaven in a cloud,
while their enemies looked on.
13At that very hour there was a severe
earthquake and a tenth of the city
collapsed. Seven thousand people were
killed in the earthquake, and the
survivors were terrified and gave glory
to the God of heaven.
14The second woe has passed; the third
woe is coming soon.
15The seventh angel sounded his
trumpet, and there were loud voices in
heaven, which said: "The kingdom of the
world has become the kingdom of our
Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign
for ever and ever."
16And the twenty-four elders, who were
seated on their thrones before God, fell
on their faces and worshiped God,
17saying: "We give thanks to you, Lord
God Almighty, the One who is and who
was, because you have taken your great
power and have begun to reign.
18The nations were angry; and your
wrath has come. The time has come for
judging the dead, and for rewarding your
servants the prophets and your saints
and those who reverence your name,
both small and great-- and for
destroying those who destroy the earth."
19Then God's temple in heaven was
opened, and within his temple was seen
the ark of his covenant. And there came
flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of
thunder, an earthquake and a great
hailstorm.
12A great and wondrous sign
appeared in heaven: a woman clothed
with the sun, with the moon under her
feet and a crown of twelve stars on her
head.
2She was pregnant and cried out in pain
as she was about to give birth.
3Then another sign appeared in heaven:
an enormous red dragon with seven
heads and ten horns and seven crowns
on his heads.
4His tail swept a third of the stars out of
the sky and flung them to the earth. The
dragon stood in front of the woman who
was about to give birth, so that he might
devour her child the moment it was born.
5She gave birth to a son, a male child,
who will rule all the nations with an iron
scepter. And her child was snatched up
to God and to his throne.
6The woman fled into the desert to a
place prepared for her by God, where
she might be taken care of for 1,260
days.
7And there was war in heaven. Michael
and his angels fought against the
dragon, and the dragon and his angels
fought back.
8But he was not strong enough, and
they lost their place in heaven.
9The great dragon was hurled down--
that ancient serpent called the devil, or
Satan, who leads the whole world astray.
He was hurled to the earth, and his
angels with him.
10Then I heard a loud voice in heaven
say: "Now have come the salvation and
the power and the kingdom of our God,
and the authority of his Christ. For the
accuser of our brothers, who accuses
them before our God day and night, has
been hurled down.
11They overcame him by the blood of
the Lamb and by the word of their
testimony; they did not love their lives so
much as to shrink from death.
12Therefore rejoice, you heavens and
you who dwell in them! But woe to the
earth and the sea, because the devil
has gone down to you! He is filled with
fury, because he knows that his time is
short."
13When the dragon saw that he had
been hurled to the earth, he pursued the
woman who had given birth to the male
child.
14The woman was given the two wings
of a great eagle, so that she might fly to
the place prepared for her in the desert,
where she would be taken care of for a
time, times and half a time, out of the
serpent's reach.
15Then from his mouth the serpent
spewed water like a river, to overtake
the woman and sweep her away with
the torrent.
16But the earth helped the woman by
opening its mouth and swallowing the
river that the dragon had spewed out of
his mouth.
17Then the dragon was enraged at the
woman and went off to make war
against the rest of her offspring--those
who obey God's commandments and
hold to the testimony of Jesus.
13And the dragon stood on the
shore of the sea.
2And I saw a beast coming out of the
sea. He had ten horns and seven heads,
with ten crowns on his horns, and on
each head a blasphemous name. The
beast I saw resembled a leopard, but
had feet like those of a bear and a
mouth like that of a lion. The dragon
gave the beast his power and his throne
and great authority.
3One of the heads of the beast seemed
to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal
wound had been healed. The whole
world was astonished and followed the
beast.
4Men worshiped the dragon because he
had given authority to the beast, and
they also worshiped the beast and
asked, "Who is like the beast? Who can
make war against him?"
5The beast was given a mouth to utter
proud words and blasphemies and to
exercise his authority for forty-two
months.
6He opened his mouth to blaspheme
God, and to slander his name and his
dwelling place and those who live in
heaven.
7He was given power to make war
against the saints and to conquer them.
And he was given authority over every
tribe, people, language and nation.
8All inhabitants of the earth will worship
the beast--all whose names have not
been written in the book of life belonging
to the Lamb that was slain from the
creation of the world.
9He who has an ear, let him hear.
10If anyone is to go into captivity, into
captivity he will go. If anyone is to be
killed with the sword, with the sword he
will be killed. This calls for patient
endurance and faithfulness on the part
of the saints.
11Then I saw another beast, coming out
of the earth. He had two horns like a
lamb, but he spoke like a dragon.
12He exercised all the authority of the
first beast on his behalf, and made the
earth and its inhabitants worship the first
beast, whose fatal wound had been
healed.
13And he performed great and
miraculous signs, even causing fire to
come down from heaven to earth in full
view of men.
14Because of the signs he was given
power to do on behalf of the first beast,
he deceived the inhabitants of the earth.
He ordered them to set up an image in
honor of the beast who was wounded by
the sword and yet lived.
15He was given power to give breath to
the image of the first beast, so that it
could speak and cause all who refused
to worship the image to be killed.
16He also forced everyone, small and
great, rich and poor, free and slave, to
receive a mark on his right hand or on
his forehead,
17so that no one could buy or sell unless
he had the mark, which is the name of
the beast or the number of his name.
18This calls for wisdom. If anyone has
insight, let him calculate the number of
the beast, for it is man's number. His
number is 666.
14Then I looked, and there before
me was the Lamb, standing on Mount
Zion, and with him 144,000 who had his
name and his Father's name written on
their foreheads.
2And I heard a sound from heaven like
the roar of rushing waters and like a
loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard
was like that of harpists playing their
harps.
3And they sang a new song before the
throne and before the four living
creatures and the elders. No one could
learn the song except the 144,000 who
had been redeemed from the earth.
4These are those who did not defile
themselves with women, for they kept
themselves pure. They follow the Lamb
wherever he goes. They were
purchased from among men and offered
as firstfruits to God and the Lamb.
5No lie was found in their mouths; they
are blameless.
6Then I saw another angel flying in
midair, and he had the eternal gospel to
proclaim to those who live on the earth--
to every nation, tribe, language and
people.
7He said in a loud voice, "Fear God and
give him glory, because the hour of his
judgment has come. Worship him who
made the heavens, the earth, the sea
and the springs of water."
8A second angel followed and said,
"Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great,
which made all the nations drink the
maddening wine of her adulteries."
9A third angel followed them and said in
a loud voice: "If anyone worships the
beast and his image and receives his
mark on the forehead or on the hand,
10he, too, will drink of the wine of God's
fury, which has been poured full
strength into the cup of his wrath. He will
be tormented with burning sulfur in the
presence of the holy angels and of the
Lamb.
11And the smoke of their torment rises
for ever and ever. There is no rest day
or night for those who worship the beast
and his image, or for anyone who
receives the mark of his name."
12This calls for patient endurance on the
part of the saints who obey God's
commandments and remain faithful to
Jesus.
13Then I heard a voice from heaven say,
"Write: Blessed are the dead who die in
the Lord from now on." "Yes," says the
Spirit, "they will rest from their labor, for
their deeds will follow them."
14I looked, and there before me was a
white cloud, and seated on the cloud
was one "like a son of man" with a
crown of gold on his head and a sharp
sickle in his hand.
15Then another angel came out of the
temple and called in a loud voice to him
who was sitting on the cloud, "Take your
sickle and reap, because the time to
reap has come, for the harvest of the
earth is ripe."
16So he who was seated on the cloud
swung his sickle over the earth, and the
earth was harvested.
17Another angel came out of the temple
in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.
18Still another angel, who had charge of
the fire, came from the altar and called
in a loud voice to him who had the sharp
sickle, "Take your sharp sickle and
gather the clusters of grapes from the
earth's vine, because its grapes are
ripe."
19The angel swung his sickle on the
earth, gathered its grapes and threw
them into the great winepress of God's
wrath.
20They were trampled in the winepress
outside the city, and blood flowed out of
the press, rising as high as the horses'
bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia.
15I saw in heaven another great and
marvelous sign: seven angels with the
seven last plagues--last, because with
them God's wrath is completed.
2And I saw what looked like a sea of
glass mixed with fire and, standing
beside the sea, those who had been
victorious over the beast and his image
and over the number of his name. They
held harps given them by God
3and sang the song of Moses the
servant of God and the song of the
Lamb: "Great and marvelous are your
deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true
are your ways, King of the ages.
4Who will not fear you, O Lord, and bring
glory to your name? For you alone are
holy. All nations will come and worship
before you, for your righteous acts have
been revealed."
5After this I looked and in heaven the
temple, that is, the tabernacle of the
Testimony, was opened.
6Out of the temple came the seven
angels with the seven plagues. They
were dressed in clean, shining linen and
wore golden sashes around their chests.
7Then one of the four living creatures
gave to the seven angels seven golden
bowls filled with the wrath of God, who
lives for ever and ever.
8And the temple was filled with smoke
from the glory of God and from his
power, and no one could enter the
temple until the seven plagues of the
seven angels were completed.
16Then I heard a loud voice from the
temple saying to the seven angels, "Go,
pour out the seven bowls of God's wrath
on the earth."
2The first angel went and poured out his
bowl on the land, and ugly and painful
sores broke out on the people who had
the mark of the beast and worshiped his
image.
3The second angel poured out his bowl
on the sea, and it turned into blood like
that of a dead man, and every living
thing in the sea died.
4The third angel poured out his bowl on
the rivers and springs of water, and they
became blood.
5Then I heard the angel in charge of the
waters say: "You are just in these
judgments, you who are and who were,
the Holy One, because you have so
judged;
6for they have shed the blood of your
saints and prophets, and you have given
them blood to drink as they deserve."
7And I heard the altar respond: "Yes,
Lord God Almighty, true and just are
your judgments."
8The fourth angel poured out his bowl on
the sun, and the sun was given power to
scorch people with fire.
9They were seared by the intense heat
and they cursed the name of God, who
had control over these plagues, but they
refused to repent and glorify him.
10The fifth angel poured out his bowl on
the throne of the beast, and his kingdom
was plunged into darkness. Men
gnawed their tongues in agony
11and cursed the God of heaven
because of their pains and their sores,
but they refused to repent of what they
had done.
12The sixth angel poured out his bowl on
the great river Euphrates, and its water
was dried up to prepare the way for the
kings from the East.
13Then I saw three evil spirits that
looked like frogs; they came out of the
mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of
the beast and out of the mouth of the
false prophet.
14They are spirits of demons performing
miraculous signs, and they go out to the
kings of the whole world, to gather them
for the battle on the great day of God
Almighty.
15"Behold, I come like a thief! Blessed is
he who stays awake and keeps his
clothes with him, so that he may not go
naked and be shamefully exposed."
16Then they gathered the kings together
to the place that in Hebrew is called
Armageddon.
17The seventh angel poured out his bowl
into the air, and out of the temple came
a loud voice from the throne, saying, "It
is done!"
18Then there came flashes of lightning,
rumblings, peals of thunder and a
severe earthquake. No earthquake like it
has ever occurred since man has been
on earth, so tremendous was the quake.
19The great city split into three parts,
and the cities of the nations collapsed.
God remembered Babylon the Great
and gave her the cup filled with the wine
of the fury of his wrath.
20Every island fled away and the
mountains could not be found.
21From the sky huge hailstones of about
a hundred pounds each fell upon men.
And they cursed God on account of the
plague of hail, because the plague was
so terrible.
17One of the seven angels who had
the seven bowls came and said to me,
"Come, I will show you the punishment
of the great prostitute, who sits on many
waters.
2With her the kings of the earth
committed adultery and the inhabitants
of the earth were intoxicated with the
wine of her adulteries."
3Then the angel carried me away in the
Spirit into a desert. There I saw a
woman sitting on a scarlet beast that
was covered with blasphemous names
and had seven heads and ten horns.
4The woman was dressed in purple and
scarlet, and was glittering with gold,
precious stones and pearls. She held a
golden cup in her hand, filled with
abominable things and the filth of her
adulteries.
5This title was written on her forehead:
6I saw that the woman was drunk with
the blood of the saints, the blood of
those who bore testimony to Jesus.
7When I saw her, I was greatly
astonished. Then the angel said to me:
"Why are you astonished? I will explain
to you the mystery of the woman and of
the beast she rides, which has the
seven heads and ten horns.
8The beast, which you saw, once was,
now is not, and will come up out of the
Abyss and go to his destruction. The
inhabitants of the earth whose names
have not been written in the book of life
from the creation of the world will be
astonished when they see the beast,
because he once was, now is not, and
yet will come.
9"This calls for a mind with wisdom. The
seven heads are seven hills on which
the woman sits.
10They are also seven kings. Five have
fallen, one is, the other has not yet
come; but when he does come, he must
remain for a little while.
11The beast who once was, and now is
not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the
seven and is going to his destruction.
12"The ten horns you saw are ten kings
who have not yet received a kingdom,
but who for one hour will receive
authority as kings along with the beast.
13They have one purpose and will give
their power and authority to the beast.
14They will make war against the Lamb,
but the Lamb will overcome them
because he is Lord of lords and King of
kings--and with him will be his called,
chosen and faithful followers."
15Then the angel said to me, "The
waters you saw, where the prostitute
sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations
and languages.
16The beast and the ten horns you saw
will hate the prostitute. They will bring
her to ruin and leave her naked; they will
eat her flesh and burn her with fire.
17For God has put it into their hearts to
accomplish his purpose by agreeing to
give the beast their power to rule, until
God's words are fulfilled.
18The woman you saw is the great city
that rules over the kings of the earth."
18After this I saw another angel
coming down from heaven. He had
great authority, and the earth was
illuminated by his splendor.
2With a mighty voice he shouted:
"Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!
She has become a home for demons
and a haunt for every evil spirit, a haunt
for every unclean and detestable bird.
3For all the nations have drunk the
maddening wine of her adulteries. The
kings of the earth committed adultery
with her, and the merchants of the earth
grew rich from her excessive luxuries."
4Then I heard another voice from
heaven say: "Come out of her, my
people, so that you will not share in her
sins, so that you will not receive any of
her plagues;
5for her sins are piled up to heaven, and
God has remembered her crimes.
6Give back to her as she has given; pay
her back double for what she has done.
Mix her a double portion from her own
cup.
7Give her as much torture and grief as
the glory and luxury she gave herself. In
her heart she boasts, 'I sit as queen; I
am not a widow, and I will never mourn.'
8Therefore in one day her plagues will
overtake her: death, mourning and
famine. She will be consumed by fire,
for mighty is the Lord God who judges
her.
9"When the kings of the earth who
committed adultery with her and shared
her luxury see the smoke of her burning,
they will weep and mourn over her.
10Terrified at her torment, they will stand
far off and cry: " 'Woe! Woe, O great city,
O Babylon, city of power! In one hour
your doom has come!'
11"The merchants of the earth will weep
and mourn over her because no one
buys their cargoes any more--
12cargoes of gold, silver, precious
stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk
and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron
wood, and articles of every kind made of
ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and
marble;
13cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of
incense, myrrh and frankincense, of
wine and olive oil, of fine flour and
wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and
carriages; and bodies and souls of men.
14"They will say, 'The fruit you longed for
is gone from you. All your riches and
splendor have vanished, never to be
recovered.'
15The merchants who sold these things
and gained their wealth from her will
stand far off, terrified at her torment.
They will weep and mourn
16and cry out: " 'Woe! Woe, O great city,
dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet,
and glittering with gold, precious stones
and pearls!
17In one hour such great wealth has
been brought to ruin!'
18"Every sea captain, and all who travel
by ship, the sailors, and all who earn
their living from the sea, will stand far off.
When they see the smoke of her
burning, they will exclaim, 'Was there
ever a city like this great city?'
19They will throw dust on their heads,
and with weeping and mourning cry out:
" 'Woe! Woe, O great city, where all who
had ships on the sea became rich
through her wealth! In one hour she has
been brought to ruin!
20Rejoice over her, O heaven! Rejoice,
saints and apostles and prophets! God
has judged her for the way she treated
you.' "
21Then a mighty angel picked up a
boulder the size of a large millstone and
threw it into the sea, and said: "With
such violence the great city of Babylon
will be thrown down, never to be found
again.
22The music of harpists and musicians,
flute players and trumpeters, will never
be heard in you again. No workman of
any trade will ever be found in you again.
The sound of a millstone will never be
heard in you again.
23The light of a lamp will never shine in
you again. The voice of bridegroom and
bride will never be heard in you again.
Your merchants were the world's great
men. By your magic spell all the nations
were led astray.
24In her was found the blood of prophets
and of the saints, and of all who have
been killed on the earth."
19After this I heard what sounded
like the roar of a great multitude in
heaven shouting: "Hallelujah! Salvation
and glory and power belong to our God,
2for true and just are his judgments. He
has condemned the great prostitute who
corrupted the earth by her adulteries. He
has avenged on her the blood of his
servants."
3And again they shouted: "Hallelujah!
The smoke from her goes up for ever
and ever."
4The twenty-four elders and the four
living creatures fell down and worshiped
God, who was seated on the throne.
And they cried: "Amen, Hallelujah!"
5Then a voice came from the throne,
saying: "Praise our God, all you his
servants, you who fear him, both small
and great!"
6Then I heard what sounded like a great
multitude, like the roar of rushing waters
and like loud peals of thunder, shouting:
"Hallelujah! For our Lord God Almighty
reigns.
7Let us rejoice and be glad and give him
glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has
come, and his bride has made herself
ready.
8Fine linen, bright and clean, was given
her to wear." (Fine linen stands for the
righteous acts of the saints.)
9Then the angel said to me, "Write:
'Blessed are those who are invited to the
wedding supper of the Lamb!' " And he
added, "These are the true words of
God."
10At this I fell at his feet to worship him.
But he said to me, "Do not do it! I am a
fellow servant with you and with your
brothers who hold to the testimony of
Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony
of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
11I saw heaven standing open and there
before me was a white horse, whose
rider is called Faithful and True. With
justice he judges and makes war.
12His eyes are like blazing fire, and on
his head are many crowns. He has a
name written on him that no one knows
but he himself.
13He is dressed in a robe dipped in
blood, and his name is the Word of God.
14The armies of heaven were following
him, riding on white horses and dressed
in fine linen, white and clean.
15Out of his mouth comes a sharp sword
with which to strike down the nations.
"He will rule them with an iron scepter."
He treads the winepress of the fury of
the wrath of God Almighty.
16On his robe and on his thigh he has
this name written:
17And I saw an angel standing in the sun,
who cried in a loud voice to all the birds
flying in midair, "Come, gather together
for the great supper of God,
18so that you may eat the flesh of kings,
generals, and mighty men, of horses
and their riders, and the flesh of all
people, free and slave, small and great."
19Then I saw the beast and the kings of
the earth and their armies gathered
together to make war against the rider
on the horse and his army.
20But the beast was captured, and with
him the false prophet who had
performed the miraculous signs on his
behalf. With these signs he had deluded
those who had received the mark of the
beast and worshiped his image. The two
of them were thrown alive into the fiery
lake of burning sulfur.
21The rest of them were killed with the
sword that came out of the mouth of the
rider on the horse, and all the birds
gorged themselves on their flesh.
20And I saw an angel coming down
out of heaven, having the key to the
Abyss and holding in his hand a great
chain.
2He seized the dragon, that ancient
serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and
bound him for a thousand years.
3He threw him into the Abyss, and
locked and sealed it over him, to keep
him from deceiving the nations anymore
until the thousand years were ended.
After that, he must be set free for a short
time.
4I saw thrones on which were seated
those who had been given authority to
judge. And I saw the souls of those who
had been beheaded because of their
testimony for Jesus and because of the
word of God. They had not worshiped
the beast or his image and had not
received his mark on their foreheads or
their hands. They came to life and
reigned with Christ a thousand years.
5(The rest of the dead did not come to
life until the thousand years were
ended.) This is the first resurrection.
6Blessed and holy are those who have
part in the first resurrection. The second
death has no power over them, but they
will be priests of God and of Christ and
will reign with him for a thousand years.
7When the thousand years are over,
Satan will be released from his prison
8and will go out to deceive the nations in
the four corners of the earth--Gog and
Magog--to gather them for battle. In
number they are like the sand on the
seashore.
9They marched across the breadth of
the earth and surrounded the camp of
God's people, the city he loves. But fire
came down from heaven and devoured
them.
10And the devil, who deceived them,
was thrown into the lake of burning
sulfur, where the beast and the false
prophet had been thrown. They will be
tormented day and night for ever and
ever.
11Then I saw a great white throne and
him who was seated on it. Earth and sky
fled from his presence, and there was
no place for them.
12And I saw the dead, great and small,
standing before the throne, and books
were opened. Another book was opened,
which is the book of life. The dead were
judged according to what they had done
as recorded in the books.
13The sea gave up the dead that were in
it, and death and Hades gave up the
dead that were in them, and each
person was judged according to what he
had done.
14Then death and Hades were thrown
into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is
the second death.
15If anyone's name was not found
written in the book of life, he was thrown
into the lake of fire.
21Then I saw a new heaven and a
new earth, for the first heaven and the
first earth had passed away, and there
was no longer any sea.
2I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem,
coming down out of heaven from God,
prepared as a bride beautifully dressed
for her husband.
3And I heard a loud voice from the
throne saying, "Now the dwelling of God
is with men, and he will live with them.
They will be his people, and God himself
will be with them and be their God.
4He will wipe every tear from their eyes.
There will be no more death or
mourning or crying or pain, for the old
order of things has passed away."
5He who was seated on the throne said,
"I am making everything new!" Then he
said, "Write this down, for these words
are trustworthy and true."
6He said to me: "It is done. I am the
Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning
and the End. To him who is thirsty I will
give to drink without cost from the spring
of the water of life.
7He who overcomes will inherit all this,
and I will be his God and he will be my
son.
8But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the
vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral,
those who practice magic arts, the
idolaters and all liars--their place will be
in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is
the second death."
9One of the seven angels who had the
seven bowls full of the seven last
plagues came and said to me, "Come, I
will show you the bride, the wife of the
Lamb."
10And he carried me away in the Spirit to
a mountain great and high, and showed
me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming
down out of heaven from God.
11It shone with the glory of God, and its
brilliance was like that of a very precious
jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.
12It had a great, high wall with twelve
gates, and with twelve angels at the
gates. On the gates were written the
names of the twelve tribes of Israel.
13There were three gates on the east,
three on the north, three on the south
and three on the west.
14The wall of the city had twelve
foundations, and on them were the
names of the twelve apostles of the
Lamb.
15The angel who talked with me had a
measuring rod of gold to measure the
city, its gates and its walls.
16The city was laid out like a square, as
long as it was wide. He measured the
city with the rod and found it to be
12,000 stadia in length, and as wide and
high as it is long.
17He measured its wall and it was 144
cubits thick, by man's measurement,
which the angel was using.
18The wall was made of jasper, and the
city of pure gold, as pure as glass.
19The foundations of the city walls were
decorated with every kind of precious
stone. The first foundation was jasper,
the second sapphire, the third
chalcedony, the fourth emerald,
20the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian,
the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl,
the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase,
the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth
amethyst.
21The twelve gates were twelve pearls,
each gate made of a single pearl. The
great street of the city was of pure gold,
like transparent glass.
22I did not see a temple in the city,
because the Lord God Almighty and the
Lamb are its temple.
23The city does not need the sun or the
moon to shine on it, for the glory of God
gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.
24The nations will walk by its light, and
the kings of the earth will bring their
splendor into it.
25On no day will its gates ever be shut,
for there will be no night there.
26The glory and honor of the nations will
be brought into it.
27Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor
will anyone who does what is shameful
or deceitful, but only those whose
names are written in the Lamb's book of
life.
22Then the angel showed me the
river of the water of life, as clear as
crystal, flowing from the throne of God
and of the Lamb
2down the middle of the great street of
the city. On each side of the river stood
the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of
fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And
the leaves of the tree are for the healing
of the nations.
3No longer will there be any curse. The
throne of God and of the Lamb will be in
the city, and his servants will serve him.
4They will see his face, and his name
will be on their foreheads.
5There will be no more night. They will
not need the light of a lamp or the light
of the sun, for the Lord God will give
them light. And they will reign for ever
and ever.
6The angel said to me, "These words
are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the
God of the spirits of the prophets, sent
his angel to show his servants the things
that must soon take place."
7"Behold, I am coming soon! Blessed is
he who keeps the words of the prophecy
in this book."
8I, John, am the one who heard and saw
these things. And when I had heard and
seen them, I fell down to worship at the
feet of the angel who had been showing
them to me.
9But he said to me, "Do not do it! I am a
fellow servant with you and with your
brothers the prophets and of all who
keep the words of this book. Worship
God!"
10Then he told me, "Do not seal up the
words of the prophecy of this book,
because the time is near.
11Let him who does wrong continue to
do wrong; let him who is vile continue to
be vile; let him who does right continue
to do right; and let him who is holy
continue to be holy."
12"Behold, I am coming soon! My reward
is with me, and I will give to everyone
according to what he has done.
13I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
First and the Last, the Beginning and
the End.
14"Blessed are those who wash their
robes, that they may have the right to
the tree of life and may go through the
gates into the city.
15Outside are the dogs, those who
practice magic arts, the sexually
immoral, the murderers, the idolaters
and everyone who loves and practices
falsehood.
16"I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give
you this testimony for the churches. I am
the Root and the Offspring of David, and
the bright Morning Star."
17The Spirit and the bride say, "Come!"
And let him who hears say, "Come!"
Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and
whoever wishes, let him take the free
gift of the water of life.
18I warn everyone who hears the words
of the prophecy of this book: If anyone
adds anything to them, God will add to
him the plagues described in this book.
19And if anyone takes words away from
this book of prophecy, God will take
away from him his share in the tree of
life and in the holy city, which are
described in this book.
20He who testifies to these things says,
"Yes, I am coming soon." Amen. Come,
Lord Jesus.
21The grace of the Lord Jesus be with
God's people. Amen.
