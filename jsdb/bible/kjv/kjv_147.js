K._Mak10_27="And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.";
K._Mak10_28="Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.";
K._Mak10_29="And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,";
K._Mak10_30="But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.";
K._Mak10_31="But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.";
K._Mak10_32="And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,";
K._Mak10_33="Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:";
K._Mak10_34="And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.";
K._Mak10_35="And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.";
K._Mak10_36="And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?";
K._Mak10_37="They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.";
K._Mak10_38="But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?";
K._Mak10_39="And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:";
K._Mak10_40="But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.";
K._Mak10_41="And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.";
K._Mak10_42="But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.";
K._Mak10_43="But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:";
K._Mak10_44="And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.";
K._Mak10_45="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.";
K._Mak10_46="And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.";
K._Mak10_47="And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.";
K._Mak10_48="And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.";
K._Mak10_49="And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.";
K._Mak10_50="And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.";
K._Mak10_51="And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.";
K._Mak10_52="And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.";
K._Mak11_1="And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,";
K._Mak11_2="And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.";
K._Mak11_3="And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.";
K._Mak11_4="And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.";
K._Mak11_5="And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?";
K._Mak11_6="And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.";
K._Mak11_7="And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.";
K._Mak11_8="And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.";
K._Mak11_9="And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:";
K._Mak11_10="Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.";
K._Mak11_11="And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.";
K._Mak11_12="And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:";
K._Mak11_13="And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.";
K._Mak11_14="And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.";
K._Mak11_15="And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;";
K._Mak11_16="And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.";
K._Mak11_17="And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.";
K._Mak11_18="And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.";
K._Mak11_19="And when even was come, he went out of the city.";
K._Mak11_20="And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.";
K._Mak11_21="And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.";
K._Mak11_22="And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.";
K._Mak11_23="For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.";
K._Mak11_24="Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.";
K._Mak11_25="And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.";
K._Mak11_26="But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.";
K._Mak11_27="And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,";
K._Mak11_28="And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?";
K._Mak11_29="And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.";
K._Mak11_30="The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.";
K._Mak11_31="And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?";
K._Mak11_32="But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.";
K._Mak11_33="And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.";
K._Mak12_1="And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.";
K._Mak12_2="And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.";
K._Mak12_3="And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.";
K._Mak12_4="And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.";
K._Mak12_5="And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.";
K._Mak12_6="Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.";
K._Mak12_7="But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.";
K._Mak12_8="And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.";
K._Mak12_9="What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.";
K._Mak12_10="And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:";
K._Mak12_11="This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?";
K._Mak12_12="And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.";
K._Mak12_13="And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.";
K._Mak12_14="And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?";
K._Mak12_15="Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.";
K._Mak12_16="And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.";
K._Mak12_17="And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.";
K._Mak12_18="Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,";
K._Mak12_19="Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.";
K._Mak12_20="Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.";
K._Mak12_21="And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.";
K._Mak12_22="And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.";
K._Mak12_23="In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.";
K._Mak12_24="And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?";
K._Mak12_25="For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.";
K._Mak12_26="And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?";
K._Mak12_27="He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.";
K._Mak12_28="And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?";
K._Mak12_29="And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:";
K._Mak12_30="And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.";
K._Mak12_31="And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.";
K._Mak12_32="And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:";
K._Mak12_33="And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.";
K._Mak12_34="And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.";
K._Mak12_35="And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?";
K._Mak12_36="For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.";
K._Mak12_37="David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.";
K._Mak12_38="And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,";
K._Mak12_39="And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:";
K._Mak12_40="Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.";
K._Mak12_41="And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.";
K._Mak12_42="And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.";
K._Mak12_43="And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:";
K._Mak12_44="For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.";
K._Mak13_1="And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!";
K._Mak13_2="And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.";
K._Mak13_3="And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,";
K._Mak13_4="Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?";
K._Mak13_5="And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:";
K._Mak13_6="For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.";
K._Mak13_7="And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.";
K._Mak13_8="For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.";
K._Mak13_9="But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.";
K._Mak13_10="And the gospel must first be published among all nations.";
K._Mak13_11="But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.";
K._Mak13_12="Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.";

K._Mak13_14="But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:";
K._Mak13_15="And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:";
K._Mak13_16="And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.";
K._Mak13_17="But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!";

K._Mak13_23="But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.";
K._Mak13_24="But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,";
K._Mak13_25="And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.";
K._Mak13_26="And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.";

K._Mak13_28="Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:";

K._Mak13_30="Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.";
K._Mak13_31="Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.";

K._Mak13_33="Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.";
K._Mak13_34="For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.";
