K._1Co11_3="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.";
K._1Co11_4="Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.";
K._1Co11_5="But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.";
K._1Co11_6="For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.";
K._1Co11_7="For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.";
K._1Co11_8="For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.";
K._1Co11_9="Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.";
K._1Co11_10="For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.";
K._1Co11_11="Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.";
K._1Co11_12="For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.";
K._1Co11_13="Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?";
K._1Co11_14="Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?";
K._1Co11_15="But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.";
K._1Co11_16="But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.";
K._1Co11_17="Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.";
K._1Co11_18="For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.";
K._1Co11_19="For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.";
K._1Co11_20="When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.";
K._1Co11_21="For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.";
K._1Co11_22="What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.";
K._1Co11_23="For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:";
K._1Co11_24="And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.";
K._1Co11_25="After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.";
K._1Co11_26="For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.";
K._1Co11_27="Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.";
K._1Co11_28="But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.";
K._1Co11_29="For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.";
K._1Co11_30="For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.";
K._1Co11_31="For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.";
K._1Co11_32="But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.";
K._1Co11_33="Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.";
K._1Co11_34="And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.";
K._1Co12_1="Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.";
K._1Co12_2="Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.";
K._1Co12_3="Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.";
K._1Co12_4="Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.";
K._1Co12_5="And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.";
K._1Co12_6="And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.";
K._1Co12_7="But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.";
K._1Co12_8="For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;";
K._1Co12_9="To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;";
K._1Co12_10="To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:";
K._1Co12_11="But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.";
K._1Co12_12="For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.";
K._1Co12_13="For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.";
K._1Co12_14="For the body is not one member, but many.";
K._1Co12_15="If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?";
K._1Co12_16="And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?";
K._1Co12_17="If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?";
K._1Co12_18="But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.";
K._1Co12_19="And if they were all one member, where were the body?";
K._1Co12_20="But now are they many members, yet but one body.";
K._1Co12_21="And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.";
K._1Co12_22="Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:";
K._1Co12_23="And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.";
K._1Co12_24="For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:";
K._1Co12_25="That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.";
K._1Co12_26="And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.";
K._1Co12_27="Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.";
K._1Co12_28="And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.";
K._1Co12_29="Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?";
K._1Co12_30="Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?";
K._1Co12_31="But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.";
K._1Co13_1="Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.";

K._1Co13_8="Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.";
K._1Co13_9="For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.";
K._1Co13_10="But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.";
K._1Co13_11="When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.";
K._1Co13_12="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.";

K._1Co14_1="Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.";
K._1Co14_2="For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.";

K._1Co14_4="He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.";
K._1Co14_5="I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.";
K._1Co14_6="Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?";
K._1Co14_7="And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?";

K._1Co14_13="Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.";
K._1Co14_14="For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.";
K._1Co14_15="What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.";
K._1Co14_16="Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?";
K._1Co14_17="For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.";
K._1Co14_18="I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:";

K._1Co14_21="In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the LORD.";
K._1Co14_22="Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.";
K._1Co14_23="If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?";

K._1Co14_25="And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.";
K._1Co14_26="How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.";
K._1Co14_27="If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.";

K._1Co15_2="By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.";
K._1Co15_3="For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;";
K._1Co15_4="And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:";
K._1Co15_5="And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:";

K._1Co15_7="After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.";
K._1Co15_8="And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.";
K._1Co15_9="For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.";
K._1Co15_10="But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.";
K._1Co15_11="Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.";
K._1Co15_12="Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?";
K._1Co15_13="But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:";
K._1Co15_14="And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.";
K._1Co15_15="Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.";

K._1Co15_19="If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.";
K._1Co15_20="But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.";
K._1Co15_21="For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.";
K._1Co15_22="For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.";

K._1Co15_25="For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.";
K._1Co15_26="The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.";
