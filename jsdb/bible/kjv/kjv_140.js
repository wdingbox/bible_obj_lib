K._Mat5_25="Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.";
K._Mat5_26="Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.";
K._Mat5_27="Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:";
K._Mat5_28="But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.";
K._Mat5_29="And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.";

K._Mat5_32="But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.";
K._Mat5_33="Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:";
K._Mat5_34="But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:";
K._Mat5_35="Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.";
K._Mat5_36="Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.";
K._Mat5_37="But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.";
K._Mat5_38="Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:";

K._Mat6_3="But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:";
K._Mat6_4="That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.";
K._Mat6_5="And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.";
K._Mat6_6="But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.";
K._Mat6_7="But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.";
K._Mat6_8="Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.";
K._Mat6_9="After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.";
K._Mat6_10="Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.";

K._Mat6_16="Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.";
K._Mat6_17="But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;";

K._Mat6_24="No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.";
K._Mat6_25="Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?";
K._Mat6_26="Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?";
K._Mat6_27="Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?";
K._Mat6_28="And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:";
K._Mat6_29="And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.";
K._Mat6_30="Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?";

K._Mat7_18="A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.";

K._Mat8_10="When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.";

K._Mat8_13="And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.";
K._Mat8_14="And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.";
K._Mat8_15="And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.";
K._Mat8_16="When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:";

K._Mat9_9="And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.";
K._Mat9_10="And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.";
K._Mat9_11="And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?";
K._Mat9_12="But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.";
K._Mat9_13="But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.";

K._Mat9_20="And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:";
