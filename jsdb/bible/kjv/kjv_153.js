K._Luk19_15="And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.";
K._Luk19_16="Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.";
K._Luk19_17="And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.";
K._Luk19_18="And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.";
K._Luk19_19="And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.";
K._Luk19_20="And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:";
K._Luk19_21="For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.";
K._Luk19_22="And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:";
K._Luk19_23="Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?";
K._Luk19_24="And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.";
K._Luk19_25="(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)";
K._Luk19_26="For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.";
K._Luk19_27="But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.";
K._Luk19_28="And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.";
K._Luk19_29="And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,";
K._Luk19_30="Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.";
K._Luk19_31="And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.";
K._Luk19_32="And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.";
K._Luk19_33="And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?";
K._Luk19_34="And they said, The Lord hath need of him.";
K._Luk19_35="And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.";
K._Luk19_36="And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.";
K._Luk19_37="And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;";
K._Luk19_38="Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.";
K._Luk19_39="And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.";
K._Luk19_40="And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.";
K._Luk19_41="And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,";
K._Luk19_42="Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.";
K._Luk19_43="For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,";
K._Luk19_44="And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.";
K._Luk19_45="And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;";
K._Luk19_46="Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.";
K._Luk19_47="And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,";
K._Luk19_48="And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.";
K._Luk20_1="And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,";
K._Luk20_2="And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?";
K._Luk20_3="And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:";
K._Luk20_4="The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?";
K._Luk20_5="And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?";
K._Luk20_6="But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.";
K._Luk20_7="And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.";
K._Luk20_8="And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.";
K._Luk20_9="Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.";
K._Luk20_10="And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.";
K._Luk20_11="And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.";
K._Luk20_12="And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.";
K._Luk20_13="Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.";
K._Luk20_14="But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.";
K._Luk20_15="So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?";
K._Luk20_16="He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.";
K._Luk20_17="And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?";
K._Luk20_18="Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.";
K._Luk20_19="And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.";
K._Luk20_20="And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.";
K._Luk20_21="And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:";
K._Luk20_22="Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?";
K._Luk20_23="But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?";
K._Luk20_24="Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.";
K._Luk20_25="And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.";
K._Luk20_26="And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.";
K._Luk20_27="Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,";

K._Luk20_29="There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.";
K._Luk20_30="And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.";
K._Luk20_31="And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.";
K._Luk20_32="Last of all the woman died also.";
K._Luk20_33="Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.";
K._Luk20_34="And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:";
K._Luk20_35="But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:";
K._Luk20_36="Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.";
K._Luk20_37="Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.";
K._Luk20_38="For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.";
K._Luk20_39="Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.";
K._Luk20_40="And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.";
K._Luk20_41="And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?";
K._Luk20_42="And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,";
K._Luk20_43="Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.";
K._Luk20_44="David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?";
K._Luk20_45="Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,";
K._Luk20_46="Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;";
K._Luk20_47="Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.";
K._Luk21_1="And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.";
K._Luk21_2="And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.";
K._Luk21_3="And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:";
K._Luk21_4="For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.";
K._Luk21_5="And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,";
K._Luk21_6="As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.";
K._Luk21_7="And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?";
K._Luk21_8="And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.";
K._Luk21_9="But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.";
K._Luk21_10="Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:";
K._Luk21_11="And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.";
