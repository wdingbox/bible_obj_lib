K._Mat15_10="And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:";
K._Mat15_11="Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.";
K._Mat15_12="Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?";

K._Mat16_10="Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?";

K._Mat16_24="Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.";
K._Mat16_25="For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.";

K._Mat17_14="And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,";

K._Mat17_19="Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?";
K._Mat17_20="And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.";

K._Mat17_22="And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:";

K._Mat17_24="And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?";
K._Mat17_25="He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?";
K._Mat17_26="Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.";
K._Mat17_27="Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.";
K._Mat18_1="At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?";
K._Mat18_2="And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,";

K._Mat18_19="Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.";
K._Mat18_20="For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.";
K._Mat18_21="Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?";
K._Mat18_22="Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.";
K._Mat18_23="Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.";
K._Mat18_24="And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.";
K._Mat18_25="But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.";
K._Mat18_26="The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.";
K._Mat18_27="Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.";

K._Mat18_30="And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.";
K._Mat18_31="So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.";
K._Mat18_32="Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:";
K._Mat18_33="Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?";
K._Mat18_34="And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.";
K._Mat18_35="So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.";
K._Mat19_1="And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;";
K._Mat19_2="And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.";
K._Mat19_3="The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?";

K._Mat19_5="And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?";
K._Mat19_6="Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.";
K._Mat19_7="They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?";
K._Mat19_8="He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.";
K._Mat19_9="And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.";
K._Mat19_10="His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.";
K._Mat19_11="But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.";
K._Mat19_12="For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.";
K._Mat19_13="Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.";

K._Mat19_15="And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.";
K._Mat19_16="And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?";
K._Mat19_17="And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.";

K._Mat19_20="The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?";

K._Mat19_22="But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.";

K._Mat19_25="When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?";
K._Mat19_26="But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.";

K._Mat20_15="Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?";
