K._Jer3_1="They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the LORD.";
K._Jer3_2="Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.";
K._Jer3_3="Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.";
K._Jer3_4="Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the guide of my youth?";
K._Jer3_5="Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.";

K._Jer3_7="And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.";
K._Jer3_8="And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.";
K._Jer3_9="And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.";
K._Jer3_10="And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD.";
K._Jer3_11="And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah.";
K._Jer3_12="Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.";

K._Jer3_16="And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.";
K._Jer3_17="At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.";
K._Jer3_18="In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.";

K._Jer4_21="How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?";
K._Jer4_22="For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.";

K._Jer4_25="I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.";
K._Jer4_26="I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.";
K._Jer4_27="For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.";

K._Jer5_7="How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.";
K._Jer5_8="They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife.";
K._Jer5_9="Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?";
K._Jer5_10="Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they are not the LORD's.";
K._Jer5_11="For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD.";
K._Jer5_12="They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:";
K._Jer5_13="And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.";

K._Jer5_16="Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.";
K._Jer5_17="And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.";
K._Jer5_18="Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.";
K._Jer5_19="And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.";

K._Jer5_22="Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?";
K._Jer5_23="But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.";
K._Jer5_24="Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.";
K._Jer5_25="Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good things from you.";

K._Jer5_27="As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.";
K._Jer5_28="They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.";
K._Jer5_29="Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?";
K._Jer5_30="A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;";
K._Jer5_31="The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?";
K._Jer6_1="O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.";
K._Jer6_2="I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.";
K._Jer6_3="The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.";

K._Jer6_5="Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.";
K._Jer6_6="For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.";
K._Jer6_7="As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.";
K._Jer6_8="Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.";
K._Jer6_9="Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.";
K._Jer6_10="To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.";
K._Jer6_11="Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.";
K._Jer6_12="And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.";
