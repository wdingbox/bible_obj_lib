K._1Ts3_10="Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?";
K._1Ts3_11="Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.";
K._1Ts3_12="And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:";
K._1Ts3_13="To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.";
K._1Ts4_1="Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.";
K._1Ts4_2="For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.";
K._1Ts4_3="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:";
K._1Ts4_4="That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;";
K._1Ts4_5="Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:";
K._1Ts4_6="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.";
K._1Ts4_7="For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.";
K._1Ts4_8="He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.";
K._1Ts4_9="But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.";
K._1Ts4_10="And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;";
K._1Ts4_11="And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;";
K._1Ts4_12="That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.";
K._1Ts4_13="But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.";
K._1Ts4_14="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.";
K._1Ts4_15="For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.";
K._1Ts4_16="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:";
K._1Ts4_17="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.";
K._1Ts4_18="Wherefore comfort one another with these words.";
K._1Ts5_1="But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.";
K._1Ts5_2="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.";
K._1Ts5_3="For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.";
K._1Ts5_4="But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.";
K._1Ts5_5="Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.";
K._1Ts5_6="Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.";
K._1Ts5_7="For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.";
K._1Ts5_8="But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.";
K._1Ts5_9="For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,";
K._1Ts5_10="Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.";
K._1Ts5_11="Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.";
K._1Ts5_12="And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;";
K._1Ts5_13="And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.";
K._1Ts5_14="Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.";
K._1Ts5_15="See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.";
K._1Ts5_16="Rejoice evermore.";
K._1Ts5_17="Pray without ceasing.";
K._1Ts5_18="In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.";

K._1Ts5_24="Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.";
K._1Ts5_25="Brethren, pray for us.";
K._1Ts5_26="Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.";
K._1Ts5_27="I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.";

K._2Ts1_3="We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;";
K._2Ts1_4="So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:";
K._2Ts1_5="Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:";
K._2Ts1_6="Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;";

K._2Ts1_8="In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:";
K._2Ts1_9="Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;";
K._2Ts1_10="When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.";
K._2Ts1_11="Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:";
K._2Ts1_12="That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.";
K._2Ts2_1="Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,";
K._2Ts2_2="That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.";
K._2Ts2_3="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;";

K._2Ts2_6="And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.";
K._2Ts2_7="For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.";
K._2Ts2_8="And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:";
K._2Ts2_9="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,";
K._2Ts2_10="And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.";
K._2Ts2_11="And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:";
K._2Ts2_12="That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.";
K._2Ts2_13="But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:";

K._2Ts3_5="And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.";
K._2Ts3_6="Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.";
K._2Ts3_7="For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;";
K._2Ts3_8="Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:";
K._2Ts3_9="Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.";
K._2Ts3_10="For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.";
K._2Ts3_11="For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.";
