K._Jer36_15="And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.";

K._Jer36_17="And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?";
K._Jer36_18="Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.";

K._Jer37_21="Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.";
K._Jer38_1="Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,";

K._Jer38_5="Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.";
K._Jer38_6="Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.";

K._Jer38_11="So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.";
K._Jer38_12="And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.";
K._Jer38_13="So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.";

K._Jer38_17="Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:";
K._Jer38_18="But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.";
K._Jer38_19="And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.";

K._Jer38_23="So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.";
K._Jer38_24="Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.";
K._Jer38_25="But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:";
K._Jer38_26="Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.";
K._Jer38_27="Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.";

K._Jer39_5="But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.";
