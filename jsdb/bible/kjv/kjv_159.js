K._Act2_8="And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?";
K._Act2_9="Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,";
K._Act2_10="Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,";
K._Act2_11="Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.";
K._Act2_12="And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?";
K._Act2_13="Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.";
K._Act2_14="But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:";
K._Act2_15="For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.";
K._Act2_16="But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;";
K._Act2_17="And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:";
K._Act2_18="And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:";

K._Act2_26="Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:";
K._Act2_27="Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.";

K._Act2_29="Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.";

K._Act2_32="This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.";
K._Act2_33="Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.";

K._Act2_35="Until I make thy foes thy footstool.";
K._Act2_36="Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.";
K._Act2_37="Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?";
K._Act2_38="Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.";

K._Act2_40="And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.";
K._Act2_41="Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.";
K._Act2_42="And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.";

K._Act3_4="And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.";
K._Act3_5="And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.";
K._Act3_6="Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.";
K._Act3_7="And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.";
K._Act3_8="And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.";
K._Act3_9="And all the people saw him walking and praising God:";
K._Act3_10="And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.";

K._Act3_12="And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?";
K._Act3_13="The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.";

K._Act3_21="Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.";

K._Act4_1="And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,";
K._Act4_2="Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.";
K._Act4_3="And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.";
K._Act4_4="Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.";
K._Act4_5="And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,";
K._Act4_6="And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.";
K._Act4_7="And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?";
K._Act4_8="Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,";
K._Act4_9="If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;";

K._Act4_12="Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.";
K._Act4_13="Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.";
K._Act4_14="And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.";
K._Act4_15="But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,";
K._Act4_16="Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.";
K._Act4_17="But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.";
K._Act4_18="And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.";
K._Act4_19="But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.";
K._Act4_20="For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.";
K._Act4_21="So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.";
K._Act4_22="For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.";
K._Act4_23="And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.";
K._Act4_24="And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:";
K._Act4_25="Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?";
K._Act4_26="The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.";
K._Act4_27="For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,";
K._Act4_28="For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.";
K._Act4_29="And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,";
K._Act4_30="By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.";
K._Act4_31="And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.";
K._Act4_32="And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.";
K._Act4_33="And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.";
K._Act4_34="Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,";
K._Act4_35="And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.";
K._Act4_36="And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,";
K._Act4_37="Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.";
K._Act5_1="But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,";
K._Act5_2="And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.";
K._Act5_3="But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?";
K._Act5_4="Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.";
K._Act5_5="And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.";
K._Act5_6="And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.";
K._Act5_7="And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.";
K._Act5_8="And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.";
K._Act5_9="Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.";
K._Act5_10="Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.";
K._Act5_11="And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.";
K._Act5_12="And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.";
K._Act5_13="And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.";
K._Act5_14="And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)";
K._Act5_15="Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.";
K._Act5_16="There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.";
K._Act5_17="Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,";
K._Act5_18="And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.";
K._Act5_19="But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,";
K._Act5_20="Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.";
K._Act5_21="And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.";
K._Act5_22="But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,";
K._Act5_23="Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.";
K._Act5_24="Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.";
K._Act5_25="Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.";
K._Act5_26="Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.";
K._Act5_27="And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,";
K._Act5_28="Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.";
K._Act5_29="Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.";
K._Act5_30="The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.";
K._Act5_31="Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.";
K._Act5_32="And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.";
K._Act5_33="When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.";
K._Act5_34="Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;";
K._Act5_35="And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.";
K._Act5_36="For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.";
K._Act5_37="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.";
K._Act5_38="And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:";
K._Act5_39="But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.";
K._Act5_40="And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.";
K._Act5_41="And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.";
K._Act5_42="And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.";
K._Act6_1="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.";
K._Act6_2="Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.";
K._Act6_3="Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.";
K._Act6_4="But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.";
K._Act6_5="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:";
K._Act6_6="Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.";
K._Act6_7="And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.";
K._Act6_8="And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.";
K._Act6_9="Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.";
K._Act6_10="And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.";
K._Act6_11="Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.";
K._Act6_12="And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,";
K._Act6_13="And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:";
K._Act6_14="For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.";
K._Act6_15="And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.";
K._Act7_1="Then said the high priest, Are these things so?";
K._Act7_2="And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,";
K._Act7_3="And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.";
K._Act7_4="Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.";
K._Act7_5="And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.";
K._Act7_6="And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.";
K._Act7_7="And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.";
K._Act7_8="And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.";
K._Act7_9="And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,";
K._Act7_10="And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.";
