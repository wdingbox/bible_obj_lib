K._Jas3_14="But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.";
K._Jas3_15="This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.";
K._Jas3_16="For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.";

K._Jas4_3="Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.";
K._Jas4_4="Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.";
