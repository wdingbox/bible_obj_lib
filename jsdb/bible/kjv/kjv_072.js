K._2Ch10_5="And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.";
K._2Ch10_6="And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?";

K._2Ch10_11="For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.";

K._2Ch12_4="And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.";
K._2Ch12_5="Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.";
K._2Ch12_6="Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.";

K._2Ch12_14="And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.";

K._2Ch13_21="But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.";
K._2Ch13_22="And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.";
K._2Ch14_1="So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.";
K._2Ch14_2="And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:";
K._2Ch14_3="For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:";

K._2Ch14_5="Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.";
K._2Ch14_6="And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.";
K._2Ch14_7="Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.";
K._2Ch14_8="And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.";

K._2Ch14_15="They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.";
K._2Ch15_1="And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:";
