K._Phl2_14="Do all things without murmurings and disputings:";
K._Phl2_15="That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;";

K._Phl2_17="Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.";
K._Phl2_18="For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.";
K._Phl2_19="But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.";
K._Phl2_20="For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.";
K._Phl2_21="For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.";
K._Phl2_22="But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.";
K._Phl2_23="Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.";
K._Phl2_24="But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.";
K._Phl2_25="Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.";
K._Phl2_26="For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.";
K._Phl2_27="For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.";
K._Phl2_28="I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.";
K._Phl2_29="Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:";
K._Phl2_30="Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.";
K._Phl3_1="Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.";
K._Phl3_2="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.";
K._Phl3_3="For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.";
K._Phl3_4="Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:";
K._Phl3_5="Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;";

K._Phl3_13="Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,";
K._Phl3_14="I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.";
K._Phl3_15="Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.";

K._Phl4_10="But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.";
