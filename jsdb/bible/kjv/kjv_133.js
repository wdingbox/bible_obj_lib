K._Hos7_10="And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.";
K._Hos7_11="Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.";
K._Hos7_12="When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.";
K._Hos7_13="Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.";
K._Hos7_14="And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.";
K._Hos7_15="Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.";

K._Hos8_5="Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?";
K._Hos8_6="For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.";
K._Hos8_7="For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.";
K._Hos8_8="Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.";
K._Hos8_9="For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.";
K._Hos8_10="Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.";
K._Hos8_11="Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.";
K._Hos8_12="I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.";
K._Hos8_13="They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.";
K._Hos8_14="For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.";

K._Hos9_8="The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.";
K._Hos9_9="They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.";
K._Hos9_10="I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.";

K._Hos10_2="Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.";
K._Hos10_3="For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?";
K._Hos10_4="They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.";
K._Hos10_5="The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.";
K._Hos10_6="It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.";
K._Hos10_7="As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.";
K._Hos10_8="The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.";
K._Hos10_9="O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.";
K._Hos10_10="It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.";
K._Hos10_11="And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.";
