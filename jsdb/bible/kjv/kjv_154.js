K._Luk23_20="Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.";
K._Luk23_21="But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.";
K._Luk23_22="And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.";
K._Luk23_23="And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.";
K._Luk23_24="And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.";
K._Luk23_25="And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.";
K._Luk23_26="And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.";

K._Luk23_35="And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.";
K._Luk23_36="And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,";
K._Luk23_37="And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.";

K._Luk23_39="And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.";
K._Luk23_40="But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?";
K._Luk23_41="And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.";

K._Luk24_16="But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.";
K._Luk24_17="And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?";
K._Luk24_18="And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?";
K._Luk24_19="And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:";
K._Luk24_20="And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.";
K._Luk24_21="But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.";
K._Luk24_22="Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;";

K._Luk24_24="And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.";

K._Luk24_29="But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.";
K._Luk24_30="And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.";
K._Luk24_31="And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.";
K._Luk24_32="And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?";

K._Luk24_37="But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.";
K._Luk24_38="And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?";
K._Luk24_39="Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.";
K._Luk24_40="And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.";
K._Luk24_41="And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?";
K._Luk24_42="And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.";
K._Luk24_43="And he took it, and did eat before them.";
K._Luk24_44="And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.";
