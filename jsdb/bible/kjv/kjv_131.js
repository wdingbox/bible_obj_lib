K._Dan5_6="Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.";
K._Dan5_7="The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.";
K._Dan5_8="Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.";
K._Dan5_9="Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.";
K._Dan5_10="Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:";
K._Dan5_11="There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;";
K._Dan5_12="Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.";
K._Dan5_13="Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?";
K._Dan5_14="I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.";
K._Dan5_15="And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing:";
K._Dan5_16="And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.";
K._Dan5_17="Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.";
K._Dan5_18="O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:";
K._Dan5_19="And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.";
K._Dan5_20="But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:";
K._Dan5_21="And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.";
K._Dan5_22="And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;";
K._Dan5_23="But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:";
K._Dan5_24="Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.";
K._Dan5_25="And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.";
K._Dan5_26="This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.";
K._Dan5_27="TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.";
K._Dan5_28="PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.";
K._Dan5_29="Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.";
K._Dan5_30="In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.";
K._Dan5_31="And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.";
K._Dan6_1="It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;";
K._Dan6_2="And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.";
K._Dan6_3="Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.";
K._Dan6_4="Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.";
K._Dan6_5="Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.";
K._Dan6_6="Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.";
K._Dan6_7="All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.";
K._Dan6_8="Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.";
K._Dan6_9="Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.";
K._Dan6_10="Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.";
K._Dan6_11="Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.";
K._Dan6_12="Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.";
K._Dan6_13="Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.";
K._Dan6_14="Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.";
K._Dan6_15="Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.";
K._Dan6_16="Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.";
K._Dan6_17="And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.";
K._Dan6_18="Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.";
K._Dan6_19="Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.";
K._Dan6_20="And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?";
K._Dan6_21="Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.";
K._Dan6_22="My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.";
K._Dan6_23="Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.";
K._Dan6_24="And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.";
K._Dan6_25="Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.";
K._Dan6_26="I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.";
K._Dan6_27="He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.";
K._Dan6_28="So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.";
K._Dan7_1="In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.";
K._Dan7_2="Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.";
K._Dan7_3="And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.";
K._Dan7_4="The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.";
K._Dan7_5="And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.";
K._Dan7_6="After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.";
K._Dan7_7="After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.";
K._Dan7_8="I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.";
K._Dan7_9="I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.";
K._Dan7_10="A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.";
K._Dan7_11="I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.";
K._Dan7_12="As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.";
K._Dan7_13="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.";
K._Dan7_14="And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.";
K._Dan7_15="I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.";
K._Dan7_16="I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.";
K._Dan7_17="These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.";
K._Dan7_18="But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.";
K._Dan7_19="Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;";
K._Dan7_20="And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.";
K._Dan7_21="I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;";
K._Dan7_22="Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.";
K._Dan7_23="Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.";
K._Dan7_24="And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.";
K._Dan7_25="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.";
K._Dan7_26="But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.";
K._Dan7_27="And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.";
K._Dan7_28="Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.";
K._Dan8_1="In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.";
K._Dan8_2="And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.";
K._Dan8_3="Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.";
K._Dan8_4="I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.";
K._Dan8_5="And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.";
K._Dan8_6="And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.";
K._Dan8_7="And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.";
K._Dan8_8="Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.";
K._Dan8_9="And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.";
K._Dan8_10="And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.";
K._Dan8_11="Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.";
K._Dan8_12="And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.";
K._Dan8_13="Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?";
K._Dan8_14="And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.";
K._Dan8_15="And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.";
K._Dan8_16="And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.";
K._Dan8_17="So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.";
K._Dan8_18="Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.";
K._Dan8_19="And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.";
K._Dan8_20="The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.";
K._Dan8_21="And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.";
K._Dan8_22="Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.";
K._Dan8_23="And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.";
K._Dan8_24="And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.";
K._Dan8_25="And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.";
K._Dan8_26="And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.";
K._Dan8_27="And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.";
K._Dan9_1="In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;";
K._Dan9_2="In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.";
K._Dan9_3="And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:";
K._Dan9_4="And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;";
K._Dan9_5="We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:";
K._Dan9_6="Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.";
K._Dan9_7="O LORD, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.";
K._Dan9_8="O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.";
K._Dan9_9="To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;";
K._Dan9_10="Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.";
K._Dan9_11="Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.";
K._Dan9_12="And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.";
K._Dan9_13="As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.";
K._Dan9_14="Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.";
K._Dan9_15="And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.";
K._Dan9_16="O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.";
K._Dan9_17="Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.";
K._Dan9_18="O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.";
K._Dan9_19="O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.";
K._Dan9_20="And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;";
K._Dan9_21="Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.";
K._Dan9_22="And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.";
K._Dan9_23="At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.";
