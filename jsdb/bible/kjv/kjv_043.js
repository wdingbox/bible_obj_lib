K._Jug16_10="And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.";
K._Jug16_11="And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.";
K._Jug16_12="Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.";
K._Jug16_13="And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.";
K._Jug16_14="And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.";
K._Jug16_15="And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.";
K._Jug16_16="And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;";
K._Jug16_17="That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.";
K._Jug16_18="And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.";
K._Jug16_19="And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.";
K._Jug16_20="And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.";
K._Jug16_21="But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.";
K._Jug16_22="Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.";
K._Jug16_23="Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.";
K._Jug16_24="And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.";
K._Jug16_25="And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.";
K._Jug16_26="And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.";
K._Jug16_27="Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.";
K._Jug16_28="And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.";
K._Jug16_29="And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.";
K._Jug16_30="And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.";
K._Jug16_31="Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.";
K._Jug17_1="And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.";
K._Jug17_2="And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.";
K._Jug17_3="And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.";
K._Jug17_4="Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.";
K._Jug17_5="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.";
K._Jug17_6="In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.";
K._Jug17_7="And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.";
K._Jug17_8="And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.";
K._Jug17_9="And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.";
K._Jug17_10="And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.";
K._Jug17_11="And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.";
K._Jug17_12="And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.";
K._Jug17_13="Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.";
K._Jug18_1="In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.";
K._Jug18_2="And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.";
K._Jug18_3="When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?";
K._Jug18_4="And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.";
K._Jug18_5="And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.";
K._Jug18_6="And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein ye go.";
K._Jug18_7="Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.";
K._Jug18_8="And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?";
K._Jug18_9="And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.";
K._Jug18_10="When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.";
K._Jug18_11="And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.";

K._Jug18_13="And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.";
K._Jug18_14="Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.";
K._Jug18_15="And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.";
K._Jug18_16="And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.";
K._Jug18_17="And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.";
K._Jug18_18="And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?";
K._Jug18_19="And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?";
K._Jug18_20="And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.";
K._Jug18_21="So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.";
K._Jug18_22="And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.";
K._Jug18_23="And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?";
K._Jug18_24="And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?";
K._Jug18_25="And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.";
K._Jug18_26="And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.";
K._Jug18_27="And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.";
K._Jug18_28="And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.";
K._Jug18_29="And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.";
K._Jug18_30="And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.";
K._Jug18_31="And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.";
K._Jug19_1="And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.";
K._Jug19_2="And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months.";
K._Jug19_3="And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.";
K._Jug19_4="And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.";
K._Jug19_5="And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.";
K._Jug19_6="And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.";
K._Jug19_7="And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.";
K._Jug19_8="And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.";
K._Jug19_9="And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.";
K._Jug19_10="But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.";
K._Jug19_11="And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.";
K._Jug19_12="And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.";
K._Jug19_13="And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.";
K._Jug19_14="And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.";
K._Jug19_15="And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging.";
K._Jug19_16="And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.";
K._Jug19_17="And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?";
K._Jug19_18="And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house.";
K._Jug19_19="Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.";
K._Jug19_20="And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.";
K._Jug19_21="So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.";
K._Jug19_22="Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him.";
K._Jug19_23="And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.";

K._Jug19_27="And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold.";
K._Jug19_28="And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.";
K._Jug19_29="And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.";
K._Jug19_30="And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.";

K._Jug20_5="And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.";
K._Jug20_6="And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.";
K._Jug20_7="Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.";
K._Jug20_8="And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.";
