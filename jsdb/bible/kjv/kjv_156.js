K._Jhn7_43="So there was a division among the people because of him.";
K._Jhn7_44="And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.";
K._Jhn7_45="Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?";
K._Jhn7_46="The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.";
K._Jhn7_47="Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?";
K._Jhn7_48="Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?";
K._Jhn7_49="But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.";
K._Jhn7_50="Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)";
K._Jhn7_51="Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?";
K._Jhn7_52="They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.";
K._Jhn7_53="And every man went unto his own house.";
K._Jhn8_1="Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.";
K._Jhn8_2="And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.";
K._Jhn8_3="And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,";
K._Jhn8_4="They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.";
K._Jhn8_5="Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?";
K._Jhn8_6="This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.";
K._Jhn8_7="So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.";
K._Jhn8_8="And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.";
K._Jhn8_9="And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.";
K._Jhn8_10="When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?";
K._Jhn8_11="She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.";
K._Jhn8_12="Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.";
K._Jhn8_13="The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.";
K._Jhn8_14="Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.";
K._Jhn8_15="Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.";
K._Jhn8_16="And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.";
K._Jhn8_17="It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.";
K._Jhn8_18="I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.";
K._Jhn8_19="Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.";
K._Jhn8_20="These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.";
K._Jhn8_21="Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.";
K._Jhn8_22="Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.";
K._Jhn8_23="And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.";
K._Jhn8_24="I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.";
K._Jhn8_25="Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.";
K._Jhn8_26="I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.";
K._Jhn8_27="They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.";
K._Jhn8_28="Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.";
K._Jhn8_29="And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.";
K._Jhn8_30="As he spake these words, many believed on him.";
K._Jhn8_31="Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;";
K._Jhn8_32="And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.";
K._Jhn8_33="They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?";
K._Jhn8_34="Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.";
K._Jhn8_35="And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.";
K._Jhn8_36="If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.";
K._Jhn8_37="I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.";
K._Jhn8_38="I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.";
K._Jhn8_39="They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.";
K._Jhn8_40="But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.";
K._Jhn8_41="Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.";
K._Jhn8_42="Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.";
K._Jhn8_43="Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.";
K._Jhn8_44="Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.";
K._Jhn8_45="And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.";
K._Jhn8_46="Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?";
K._Jhn8_47="He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.";
K._Jhn8_48="Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?";
K._Jhn8_49="Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.";
K._Jhn8_50="And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.";
K._Jhn8_51="Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.";
K._Jhn8_52="Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.";
K._Jhn8_53="Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?";
K._Jhn8_54="Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:";
K._Jhn8_55="Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.";
K._Jhn8_56="Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.";
K._Jhn8_57="Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?";
K._Jhn8_58="Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.";
K._Jhn8_59="Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.";
K._Jhn9_1="And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.";
K._Jhn9_2="And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?";
K._Jhn9_3="Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.";
K._Jhn9_4="I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.";
K._Jhn9_5="As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.";
K._Jhn9_6="When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,";
K._Jhn9_7="And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.";
K._Jhn9_8="The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?";
K._Jhn9_9="Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.";
K._Jhn9_10="Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?";
K._Jhn9_11="He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.";
K._Jhn9_12="Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.";
K._Jhn9_13="They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.";
K._Jhn9_14="And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.";
K._Jhn9_15="Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.";
K._Jhn9_16="Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.";
K._Jhn9_17="They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.";
K._Jhn9_18="But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.";
K._Jhn9_19="And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?";
K._Jhn9_20="His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:";
K._Jhn9_21="But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.";
K._Jhn9_22="These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.";
K._Jhn9_23="Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.";
K._Jhn9_24="Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.";
K._Jhn9_25="He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.";
K._Jhn9_26="Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?";
K._Jhn9_27="He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?";
K._Jhn9_28="Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.";
K._Jhn9_29="We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.";
K._Jhn9_30="The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.";
K._Jhn9_31="Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.";
K._Jhn9_32="Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.";
K._Jhn9_33="If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.";
K._Jhn9_34="They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.";
K._Jhn9_35="Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?";
K._Jhn9_36="He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?";
K._Jhn9_37="And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.";
K._Jhn9_38="And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.";
K._Jhn9_39="And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.";
K._Jhn9_40="And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?";
K._Jhn9_41="Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.";
K._Jhn10_1="Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.";
K._Jhn10_2="But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.";
K._Jhn10_3="To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.";
K._Jhn10_4="And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.";
K._Jhn10_5="And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.";
K._Jhn10_6="This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.";
K._Jhn10_7="Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.";
K._Jhn10_8="All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.";
K._Jhn10_9="I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.";
K._Jhn10_10="The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.";
K._Jhn10_11="I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.";
K._Jhn10_12="But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.";
K._Jhn10_13="The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.";
K._Jhn10_14="I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.";
K._Jhn10_15="As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.";
K._Jhn10_16="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.";
K._Jhn10_17="Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.";
K._Jhn10_18="No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.";
K._Jhn10_19="There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.";
K._Jhn10_20="And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?";
K._Jhn10_21="Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?";
K._Jhn10_22="And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.";
K._Jhn10_23="And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.";
K._Jhn10_24="Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.";
K._Jhn10_25="Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.";
K._Jhn10_26="But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.";
K._Jhn10_27="My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:";
K._Jhn10_28="And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.";
K._Jhn10_29="My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.";
K._Jhn10_30="I and my Father are one.";
K._Jhn10_31="Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.";
K._Jhn10_32="Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?";
K._Jhn10_33="The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.";
K._Jhn10_34="Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?";
K._Jhn10_35="If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;";
K._Jhn10_36="Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?";
K._Jhn10_37="If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.";
K._Jhn10_38="But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.";
K._Jhn10_39="Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,";
K._Jhn10_40="And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.";
K._Jhn10_41="And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.";
K._Jhn10_42="And many believed on him there.";
K._Jhn11_1="Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.";

K._Jhn11_4="When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.";
K._Jhn11_5="Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.";
K._Jhn11_6="When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.";
K._Jhn11_7="Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.";
K._Jhn11_8="His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?";
K._Jhn11_9="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.";
K._Jhn11_10="But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.";
K._Jhn11_11="These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.";
K._Jhn11_12="Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.";
K._Jhn11_13="Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.";

K._Jhn11_26="And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?";
K._Jhn11_27="She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.";
K._Jhn11_28="And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.";

K._Jhn11_31="The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.";
K._Jhn11_32="Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.";
K._Jhn11_33="When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,";
K._Jhn11_34="And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.";
K._Jhn11_35="Jesus wept.";
K._Jhn11_36="Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!";
K._Jhn11_37="And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?";
K._Jhn11_38="Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.";
K._Jhn11_39="Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.";
K._Jhn11_40="Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?";
K._Jhn11_41="Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.";
K._Jhn11_42="And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.";
K._Jhn11_43="And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.";
K._Jhn11_44="And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.";
K._Jhn11_45="Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.";
K._Jhn11_46="But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.";
K._Jhn11_47="Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.";
K._Jhn11_48="If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.";
K._Jhn11_49="And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,";
K._Jhn11_50="Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.";
K._Jhn11_51="And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;";
K._Jhn11_52="And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.";
K._Jhn11_53="Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.";
K._Jhn11_54="Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.";
K._Jhn11_55="And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.";
K._Jhn11_56="Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?";
K._Jhn11_57="Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.";
