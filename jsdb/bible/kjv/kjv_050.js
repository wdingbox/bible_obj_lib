K._1Sa29_7="Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.";

K._1Sa30_22="Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.";
K._1Sa30_23="Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.";
