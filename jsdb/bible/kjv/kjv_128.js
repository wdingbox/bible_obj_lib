K._Eze41_6="And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.";
K._Eze41_7="And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst.";
K._Eze41_8="I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.";
K._Eze41_9="The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within.";

K._Eze41_18="And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;";

K._Eze41_22="The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD.";
K._Eze41_23="And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.";
K._Eze41_24="And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.";
K._Eze41_25="And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without.";
K._Eze41_26="And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.";
K._Eze42_1="Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.";
K._Eze42_2="Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.";
K._Eze42_3="Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.";
K._Eze42_4="And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.";
K._Eze42_5="Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.";
K._Eze42_6="For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.";
K._Eze42_7="And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.";
K._Eze42_8="For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits.";
K._Eze42_9="And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.";
K._Eze42_10="The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.";
K._Eze42_11="And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.";
K._Eze42_12="And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.";
K._Eze42_13="Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.";
K._Eze42_14="When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people.";
K._Eze42_15="Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.";
K._Eze42_16="He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.";
K._Eze42_17="He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.";

K._Eze42_19="He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.";
K._Eze42_20="He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.";
K._Eze43_1="Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east:";
K._Eze43_2="And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.";
K._Eze43_3="And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.";
K._Eze43_4="And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.";
K._Eze43_5="So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.";
K._Eze43_6="And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me.";
K._Eze43_7="And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.";
K._Eze43_8="In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.";
K._Eze43_9="Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.";
K._Eze43_10="Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.";
K._Eze43_11="And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.";
K._Eze43_12="This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.";
K._Eze43_13="And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the altar.";
K._Eze43_14="And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit.";
K._Eze43_15="So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns.";
K._Eze43_16="And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof.";
K._Eze43_17="And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.";
K._Eze43_18="And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.";
K._Eze43_19="And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.";
K._Eze43_20="And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.";
K._Eze43_21="Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.";
K._Eze43_22="And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.";
K._Eze43_23="When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.";
K._Eze43_24="And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the LORD.";
K._Eze43_25="Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.";
K._Eze43_26="Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.";
K._Eze43_27="And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.";
K._Eze44_1="Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.";
K._Eze44_2="Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.";
