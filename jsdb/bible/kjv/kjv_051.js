He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.";
K._2Sa4_5="And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.";
K._2Sa4_6="And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.";
K._2Sa4_7="For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.";
K._2Sa4_8="And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.";
K._2Sa4_9="And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,";
K._2Sa4_10="When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:";
K._2Sa4_11="How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?";
K._2Sa4_12="And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.";
K._2Sa5_1="Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.";
K._2Sa5_2="Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.";
K._2Sa5_3="So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.";
K._2Sa5_4="David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.";
K._2Sa5_5="In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.";

K._2Sa5_7="Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.";
K._2Sa5_8="And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.";
K._2Sa5_9="So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.";

K._2Sa5_11="And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.";

K._2Sa5_19="And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.";
K._2Sa5_20="And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.";

K._2Sa5_25="And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.";
K._2Sa6_1="Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.";
K._2Sa6_2="And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.";
K._2Sa6_3="And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.";

K._2Sa6_8="And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.";
K._2Sa6_9="And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?";
K._2Sa6_10="So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.";
K._2Sa6_11="And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.";
K._2Sa6_12="And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.";

K._2Sa6_14="And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.";
K._2Sa6_15="So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.";
K._2Sa6_16="And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.";
K._2Sa6_17="And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.";
K._2Sa6_18="And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.";
K._2Sa6_19="And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.";
K._2Sa6_20="Then David returned to bless his household.

K._2Sa6_21="And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.";

K._2Sa7_4="And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,";

K._2Sa7_10="Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,";
K._2Sa7_11="And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.";
K._2Sa7_12="And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.";
K._2Sa7_13="He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.";
K._2Sa7_14="I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:";
K._2Sa7_15="But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.";

K._2Sa7_17="According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.";
K._2Sa7_18="Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?";
K._2Sa7_19="And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?";
K._2Sa7_20="And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.";
K._2Sa7_21="For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.";
K._2Sa7_22="Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.";
K._2Sa7_23="And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?";
K._2Sa7_24="For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.";
K._2Sa7_25="And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.";
K._2Sa7_26="And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.";
K._2Sa7_27="For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.";
