K._Eze7_19="They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.";
K._Eze7_20="As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.";

K._Eze8_1="And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.";
K._Eze8_2="Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.";

K._Eze8_5="Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.";
K._Eze8_6="He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations.";
K._Eze8_7="And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.";
K._Eze8_8="Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.";

K._Eze8_17="Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man?

K._Eze11_13="And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?";
K._Eze11_14="Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,";
K._Eze11_15="Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.";

K._Eze12_1="The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying,";
K._Eze12_2="Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.";
K._Eze12_3="Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.";
K._Eze12_4="Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.";
K._Eze12_5="Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.";
K._Eze12_6="In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.";
K._Eze12_7="And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.";
K._Eze12_8="And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,";
K._Eze12_9="Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?";

K._Eze12_18="Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;";
K._Eze12_19="And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.";
K._Eze12_20="And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.";
K._Eze12_21="And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,";
K._Eze12_22="Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?";
K._Eze12_23="Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.";
K._Eze12_24="For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.";
K._Eze12_25="For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.";
K._Eze12_26="Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,";
K._Eze12_27="Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far off.";
K._Eze12_28="Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.";
K._Eze13_1="And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,";
K._Eze13_2="Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD;";
K._Eze13_3="Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!";
K._Eze13_4="O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.";
K._Eze13_5="Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.";
K._Eze13_6="They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.";
K._Eze13_7="Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have not spoken?";

K._Eze13_9="And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.";
K._Eze13_10="Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered morter:";
K._Eze13_11="Say unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.";
K._Eze13_12="Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?";
K._Eze13_13="Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.";
K._Eze13_14="So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.";
K._Eze13_15="Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter, and will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;";
K._Eze13_16="To wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord GOD.";
K._Eze13_17="Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,";
K._Eze13_18="And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you?";

K._Eze13_20="Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly.";
K._Eze13_21="Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.";
