K._Act16_15="And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.";
K._Act16_16="And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:";
K._Act16_17="The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.";
K._Act16_18="And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.";
K._Act16_19="And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,";
K._Act16_20="And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,";
K._Act16_21="And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.";
K._Act16_22="And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.";
K._Act16_23="And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:";
K._Act16_24="Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.";
K._Act16_25="And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.";
K._Act16_26="And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.";
K._Act16_27="And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.";
K._Act16_28="But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.";
K._Act16_29="Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,";
K._Act16_30="And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?";
K._Act16_31="And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.";
K._Act16_32="And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.";
K._Act16_33="And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.";
K._Act16_34="And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.";
K._Act16_35="And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.";
K._Act16_36="And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.";
K._Act16_37="But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.";
K._Act16_38="And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.";
K._Act16_39="And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.";
K._Act16_40="And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.";
K._Act17_1="Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:";
K._Act17_2="And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,";
K._Act17_3="Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.";
K._Act17_4="And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.";
K._Act17_5="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.";
K._Act17_6="And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;";
K._Act17_7="Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.";
K._Act17_8="And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.";
K._Act17_9="And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.";
K._Act17_10="And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.";
K._Act17_11="These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.";
K._Act17_12="Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.";
K._Act17_13="But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.";
K._Act17_14="And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.";
K._Act17_15="And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.";
K._Act17_16="Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.";
K._Act17_17="Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.";
K._Act17_18="Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.";
K._Act17_19="And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?";
K._Act17_20="For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.";
K._Act17_21="(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)";
K._Act17_22="Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.";
K._Act17_23="For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.";
K._Act17_24="God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;";
K._Act17_25="Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;";
K._Act17_26="And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;";
K._Act17_27="That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:";
K._Act17_28="For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.";
K._Act17_29="Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.";
K._Act17_30="And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:";
K._Act17_31="Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.";
K._Act17_32="And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.";
K._Act17_33="So Paul departed from among them.";
K._Act17_34="Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.";
K._Act18_1="After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;";
K._Act18_2="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.";
K._Act18_3="And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.";
K._Act18_4="And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.";
K._Act18_5="And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.";
K._Act18_6="And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.";
K._Act18_7="And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.";
K._Act18_8="And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.";
K._Act18_9="Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:";
K._Act18_10="For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.";
K._Act18_11="And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.";
K._Act18_12="And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,";
K._Act18_13="Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.";
K._Act18_14="And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:";
K._Act18_15="But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.";
K._Act18_16="And he drave them from the judgment seat.";
K._Act18_17="Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.";
K._Act18_18="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.";
K._Act18_19="And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.";
K._Act18_20="When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;";
K._Act18_21="But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.";
K._Act18_22="And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.";
K._Act18_23="And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.";
K._Act18_24="And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.";
K._Act18_25="This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.";
K._Act18_26="And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.";
K._Act18_27="And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:";
K._Act18_28="For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.";
K._Act19_1="And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,";
K._Act19_2="He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.";
K._Act19_3="And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.";
K._Act19_4="Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.";
K._Act19_5="When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.";
K._Act19_6="And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.";
K._Act19_7="And all the men were about twelve.";
K._Act19_8="And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.";
K._Act19_9="But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.";
K._Act19_10="And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.";
K._Act19_11="And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:";
K._Act19_12="So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.";
K._Act19_13="Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.";
K._Act19_14="And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.";
K._Act19_15="And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?";
K._Act19_16="And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.";
K._Act19_17="And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.";
K._Act19_18="And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.";
K._Act19_19="Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.";
K._Act19_20="So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.";
K._Act19_21="After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.";
K._Act19_22="So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.";
K._Act19_23="And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.";
K._Act19_24="For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;";
K._Act19_25="Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.";
K._Act19_26="Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:";
K._Act19_27="So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.";
K._Act19_28="And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.";
K._Act19_29="And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.";
K._Act19_30="And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.";
K._Act19_31="And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.";
K._Act19_32="Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.";
K._Act19_33="And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.";
K._Act19_34="But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.";
K._Act19_35="And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?";
K._Act19_36="Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.";
K._Act19_37="For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.";
K._Act19_38="Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.";
K._Act19_39="But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.";
K._Act19_40="For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.";
K._Act19_41="And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.";
K._Act20_1="And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.";
K._Act20_2="And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,";
K._Act20_3="And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.";
K._Act20_4="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.";
K._Act20_5="These going before tarried for us at Troas.";
K._Act20_6="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.";
K._Act20_7="And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.";
K._Act20_8="And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.";
K._Act20_9="And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.";
K._Act20_10="And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.";
K._Act20_11="When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.";
K._Act20_12="And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.";
K._Act20_13="And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.";
K._Act20_14="And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.";
K._Act20_15="And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.";
K._Act20_16="For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.";
K._Act20_17="And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.";
K._Act20_18="And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,";
K._Act20_19="Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:";
