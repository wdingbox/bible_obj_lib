K._1Ki17_6="And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.";
K._1Ki17_7="And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.";
K._1Ki17_8="And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,";

K._1Ki17_10="So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.";
K._1Ki17_11="And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.";
K._1Ki17_12="And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.";
K._1Ki17_13="And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.";

K._1Ki17_24="And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.";
K._1Ki18_1="And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.";
K._1Ki18_2="And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria.";
K._1Ki18_3="And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:";

K._1Ki18_12="And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.";
K._1Ki18_13="Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?";

K._1Ki18_15="And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.";
K._1Ki18_16="So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.";
K._1Ki18_17="And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?";
K._1Ki18_18="And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.";
K._1Ki18_19="Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.";
K._1Ki18_20="So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.";
K._1Ki18_21="And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.";

K._1Ki18_28="And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.";
K._1Ki18_29="And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.";
K._1Ki18_30="And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.";

K._1Ki18_32="And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.";
K._1Ki18_33="And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.";
K._1Ki18_34="And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.";
K._1Ki18_35="And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.";
K._1Ki18_36="And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.";
K._1Ki18_37="Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.";
K._1Ki18_38="Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.";
K._1Ki18_39="And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.";
