K._Jhn4_7="There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.";
K._Jhn4_8="(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)";
K._Jhn4_9="Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.";
K._Jhn4_10="Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.";
K._Jhn4_11="The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?";
K._Jhn4_12="Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?";
K._Jhn4_13="Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:";
K._Jhn4_14="But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.";
K._Jhn4_15="The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.";
K._Jhn4_16="Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.";
K._Jhn4_17="The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:";
K._Jhn4_18="For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.";
K._Jhn4_19="The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.";
K._Jhn4_20="Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.";
K._Jhn4_21="Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.";
K._Jhn4_22="Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.";
K._Jhn4_23="But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.";
K._Jhn4_24="God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.";
K._Jhn4_25="The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.";
K._Jhn4_26="Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.";
K._Jhn4_27="And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?";
K._Jhn4_28="The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,";
K._Jhn4_29="Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?";
K._Jhn4_30="Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.";
K._Jhn4_31="In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.";
K._Jhn4_32="But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.";
K._Jhn4_33="Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?";
K._Jhn4_34="Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.";
K._Jhn4_35="Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.";
K._Jhn4_36="And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.";
K._Jhn4_37="And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.";
K._Jhn4_38="I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.";
K._Jhn4_39="And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.";
K._Jhn4_40="So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.";
K._Jhn4_41="And many more believed because of his own word;";
K._Jhn4_42="And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.";
K._Jhn4_43="Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.";
K._Jhn4_44="For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.";
K._Jhn4_45="Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.";
K._Jhn4_46="So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.";
K._Jhn4_47="When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.";
K._Jhn4_48="Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.";
K._Jhn4_49="The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.";
K._Jhn4_50="Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.";
K._Jhn4_51="And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.";
K._Jhn4_52="Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.";
K._Jhn4_53="So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.";
K._Jhn4_54="This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.";
K._Jhn5_1="After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.";
K._Jhn5_2="Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.";
K._Jhn5_3="In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.";
K._Jhn5_4="For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.";
K._Jhn5_5="And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.";
K._Jhn5_6="When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?";
K._Jhn5_7="The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.";
K._Jhn5_8="Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.";
K._Jhn5_9="And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.";
K._Jhn5_10="The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.";
K._Jhn5_11="He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.";
K._Jhn5_12="Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?";
K._Jhn5_13="And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.";
K._Jhn5_14="Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.";
K._Jhn5_15="The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.";
K._Jhn5_16="And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.";
K._Jhn5_17="But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.";
K._Jhn5_18="Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.";
K._Jhn5_19="Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.";
K._Jhn5_20="For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.";
K._Jhn5_21="For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.";
K._Jhn5_22="For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:";
K._Jhn5_23="That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.";
K._Jhn5_24="Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.";
K._Jhn5_25="Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.";
K._Jhn5_26="For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;";
K._Jhn5_27="And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.";
K._Jhn5_28="Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,";
K._Jhn5_29="And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.";
K._Jhn5_30="I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.";
K._Jhn5_31="If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.";
K._Jhn5_32="There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.";
K._Jhn5_33="Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.";
K._Jhn5_34="But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.";
K._Jhn5_35="He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.";
K._Jhn5_36="But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.";
K._Jhn5_37="And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.";
K._Jhn5_38="And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.";
K._Jhn5_39="Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.";
K._Jhn5_40="And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.";
K._Jhn5_41="I receive not honour from men.";
K._Jhn5_42="But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.";
K._Jhn5_43="I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.";
K._Jhn5_44="How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?";
K._Jhn5_45="Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.";
K._Jhn5_46="For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.";
K._Jhn5_47="But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?";
K._Jhn6_1="After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.";
K._Jhn6_2="And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.";
K._Jhn6_3="And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.";
K._Jhn6_4="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.";
K._Jhn6_5="When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?";
K._Jhn6_6="And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.";
K._Jhn6_7="Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.";
K._Jhn6_8="One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,";
K._Jhn6_9="There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?";
K._Jhn6_10="And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.";
K._Jhn6_11="And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.";
K._Jhn6_12="When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.";
K._Jhn6_13="Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.";
K._Jhn6_14="Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.";
K._Jhn6_15="When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.";
K._Jhn6_16="And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,";
K._Jhn6_17="And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.";
K._Jhn6_18="And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.";
K._Jhn6_19="So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.";
K._Jhn6_20="But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.";
K._Jhn6_21="Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.";
K._Jhn6_22="The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;";
K._Jhn6_23="(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)";
K._Jhn6_24="When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.";
K._Jhn6_25="And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?";
K._Jhn6_26="Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.";
K._Jhn6_27="Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.";
K._Jhn6_28="Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?";
K._Jhn6_29="Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.";
K._Jhn6_30="They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?";
K._Jhn6_31="Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.";
K._Jhn6_32="Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.";
K._Jhn6_33="For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.";
K._Jhn6_34="Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.";
K._Jhn6_35="And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.";
K._Jhn6_36="But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.";
K._Jhn6_37="All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.";
K._Jhn6_38="For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.";
K._Jhn6_39="And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.";
K._Jhn6_40="And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.";
K._Jhn6_41="The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.";
K._Jhn6_42="And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?";
K._Jhn6_43="Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.";
K._Jhn6_44="No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.";
K._Jhn6_45="It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.";
K._Jhn6_46="Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.";
K._Jhn6_47="Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.";
K._Jhn6_48="I am that bread of life.";
K._Jhn6_49="Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.";
K._Jhn6_50="This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.";
K._Jhn6_51="I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.";
K._Jhn6_52="The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?";
K._Jhn6_53="Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.";
K._Jhn6_54="Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.";
K._Jhn6_55="For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.";
K._Jhn6_56="He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.";
K._Jhn6_57="As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.";
K._Jhn6_58="This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.";
K._Jhn6_59="These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.";
K._Jhn6_60="Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?";
K._Jhn6_61="When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?";
K._Jhn6_62="What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?";
K._Jhn6_63="It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.";
K._Jhn6_64="But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.";
K._Jhn6_65="And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.";
K._Jhn6_66="From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.";
K._Jhn6_67="Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?";
K._Jhn6_68="Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.";
K._Jhn6_69="And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.";
K._Jhn6_70="Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?";
K._Jhn6_71="He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.";
K._Jhn7_1="After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.";
K._Jhn7_2="Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.";
K._Jhn7_3="His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.";
K._Jhn7_4="For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.";
K._Jhn7_5="For neither did his brethren believe in him.";
K._Jhn7_6="Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.";
K._Jhn7_7="The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.";
K._Jhn7_8="Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come.";
K._Jhn7_9="When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.";
K._Jhn7_10="But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.";
K._Jhn7_11="Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?";
K._Jhn7_12="And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.";
K._Jhn7_13="Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.";
K._Jhn7_14="Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.";
K._Jhn7_15="And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?";
K._Jhn7_16="Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.";
K._Jhn7_17="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.";
K._Jhn7_18="He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.";
K._Jhn7_19="Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?";
K._Jhn7_20="The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?";
K._Jhn7_21="Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.";
K._Jhn7_22="Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.";
K._Jhn7_23="If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?";
K._Jhn7_24="Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.";
K._Jhn7_25="Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?";
K._Jhn7_26="But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?";
K._Jhn7_27="Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.";
K._Jhn7_28="Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.";
K._Jhn7_29="But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.";
K._Jhn7_30="Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.";
K._Jhn7_31="And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?";
K._Jhn7_32="The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.";
K._Jhn7_33="Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.";
K._Jhn7_34="Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.";
K._Jhn7_35="Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?";
K._Jhn7_36="What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?";
K._Jhn7_37="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.";
K._Jhn7_38="He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.";
K._Jhn7_39="(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)";
K._Jhn7_40="Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.";
K._Jhn7_41="Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?";
K._Jhn7_42="Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?";
