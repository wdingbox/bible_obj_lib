K._2Ki4_6="And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.";
K._2Ki4_7="Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.";
K._2Ki4_8="And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.";

K._2Ki4_14="And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.";
K._2Ki4_15="And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.";
K._2Ki4_16="And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.";
K._2Ki4_17="And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.";
K._2Ki4_18="And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.";

K._2Ki4_28="Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?";
K._2Ki4_29="Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.";

K._2Ki4_33="He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD.";
K._2Ki4_34="And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.";

K._2Ki5_1="Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.";

K._2Ki5_8="And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.";
K._2Ki5_9="So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.";

K._2Ki5_19="And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.";
K._2Ki5_20="But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.";

K._2Ki5_22="And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.";

K._2Ki6_15="And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?";
K._2Ki6_16="And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.";
K._2Ki6_17="And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.";

K._2Ki6_22="And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.";
K._2Ki6_23="And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.";
K._2Ki6_24="And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.";
K._2Ki6_25="And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.";
K._2Ki6_26="And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.";

K._2Ki6_31="Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.";
K._2Ki6_32="But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?";
K._2Ki6_33="And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?";

K._2Ki7_7="Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.";
K._2Ki7_8="And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.";
K._2Ki7_9="Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.";
