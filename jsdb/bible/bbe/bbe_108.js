B._Isa49_7="The Lord who takes up Israel's cause, even his Holy One, says to him whom men make sport of, who is hated by the nations, a servant of rulers: Kings will see and get up from their places, and chiefs will give worship: because of the Lord who keeps faith; even the Holy One of Israel who has taken you for himself.";
B._Isa49_8="This is the word of the Lord: I have given ear to you at a good time, and I have been your helper in a day of salvation: and I will keep you safe, and will make you a glory for the people, putting the land in order, and giving them the heritages which now are waste;";
B._Isa49_9="Saying to those who are in chains, Go free; to those who are in the dark, Come out into the light. They will get food by the way wherever they go, and have grass-lands on all the dry mountain-tops.";
B._Isa49_10="They will not be in need of food or drink, or be troubled by the heat or the sun: for he who has mercy on them will be their guide, taking them by the springs of water.";
B._Isa49_11="And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways will be lifted up.";
B._Isa49_12="See, these are coming from far; and these from the north and the west; and these from the land of Sinim.";
B._Isa49_13="Let your voice be loud in song, O heavens; and be glad, O earth; make sounds of joy, O mountains, for the Lord has given comfort to his people, and will have mercy on his crushed ones.";
B._Isa49_14="But Zion said, The Lord has given me up, I have gone from his memory.";
B._Isa49_15="Will a woman give up the child at her breast, will she be without pity for the fruit of her body? yes, these may, but I will not let you go out of my memory.";
B._Isa49_16="See, your name is marked on my hands; your walls are ever before me.";
B._Isa49_17="Your builders are coming quickly; your haters and those who made you waste will go out of you.";
B._Isa49_18="Let your eyes be lifted up round about, and see: they are all coming together to you. By my life, says the Lord, truly you will put them all on you as an ornament, and be clothed with them like a bride.";
B._Isa49_19="For though the waste places of your land have been given to destruction, now you will not be wide enough for your people, and those who made you waste will be far away.";
B._Isa49_20="The children to whom you gave birth in other lands will say in your ears, The place is not wide enough for me: make room for me to have a resting-place.";
B._Isa49_21="Then you will say in your heart, Who has given me all these children? when my children had been taken from me, and I was no longer able to have others, who took care of these? when I was by myself, where then were these?";
B._Isa49_22="This is the word of the Lord God: See, I will make a sign with my hand to the nations, and put up my flag for the peoples; and they will take up your sons on their beasts, and your daughters on their backs.";
B._Isa49_23="And kings will take care of you, and queens will give you their milk: they will go down on their faces before you, kissing the dust of your feet; and you will be certain that I am the Lord, and that those who put their hope in me will not be shamed.";
B._Isa49_24="Will the goods of war be taken from the strong man, or the prisoners of the cruel one be let go?";
B._Isa49_25="But the Lord says, Even the prisoners of the strong will be taken from him, and the cruel made to let go his goods: for I will take up your cause against your haters, and I will keep your children safe.";
B._Isa49_26="And the flesh of your attackers will be taken by themselves for food; and they will take their blood for drink, as if it was sweet wine: and all men will see that I the Lord am your saviour, even he who takes up your cause, the Strong One of Jacob.";
B._Isa50_1="This is the word of the Lord: Where is the statement which I gave your mother when I put her away? or to which of my creditors have I given you for money? It was for your sins that you were given into the hands of others, and for your evil-doing was your mother put away.";
B._Isa50_2="Why, then, when I came, was there no man? and no one to give answer to my voice? has my hand become feeble, so that it is unable to take up your cause? or have I no power to make you free? See, at my word the sea becomes dry, I make the rivers a waste land: their fish are dead for need of water, and make an evil smell.";
B._Isa50_3="By me the heavens are clothed with black, and I make haircloth their robe.";
B._Isa50_4="The Lord God has given me the tongue of those who are experienced, so that I may be able to give the word a special sense for the feeble: every morning my ear is open to his teaching, like those who are experienced:";
B._Isa50_5="And I have not put myself against him, or let my heart be turned back from him.";
B._Isa50_6="I was offering my back to those who gave me blows, and my face to those who were pulling out my hair: I did not keep my face covered from marks of shame.";
B._Isa50_7="For the Lord God is my helper; I will not be put to shame: so I have made my face like a rock, and I am certain that he will give me my right.";
B._Isa50_8="He who takes up my cause is near; who will go to law with me? let us come together before the judge: who is against me? let him come near to me.";
B._Isa50_9="See, the Lord God is my helper; who will give a decision against me? truly, all of them will become old like a robe; they will be food for the worm.";
B._Isa50_10="Who among you has the fear of the Lord, giving ear to the voice of his servant who has been walking in the dark and has no light? Let him put his faith in the name of the Lord, looking to his God for support.";
B._Isa50_11="See, all you who make a fire, arming yourselves with burning branches: go in the flame of your fire, and among the branches you have put a light to. This will you have from my hand, you will make your bed in sorrow.";
B._Isa51_1="Give ear to me, you who are searching for righteousness, who are looking for the Lord: see the rock from which you were cut out, and the hole out of which you were taken.";
B._Isa51_2="Let your thoughts be turned to Abraham, your father, and to Sarah, who gave you birth: for when he was but one, my voice came to him, and I gave him my blessing, and made him a great people.";
B._Isa51_3="For the Lord has given comfort to Zion: he has made glad all her broken walls; making her waste places like Eden, and changing her dry land into the garden of the Lord; joy and delight will be there, praise and the sound of melody.";
B._Isa51_4="Give attention to me, O my people; and give ear to me, O my nation; for teaching will go out from me, and the knowledge of the true God will be a light to the peoples.";
B._Isa51_5="Suddenly will my righteousness come near, and my salvation will be shining out like the light; the sea-lands will be waiting for me, and they will put their hope in my strong arm.";
B._Isa51_6="Let your eyes be lifted up to the heavens, and turned to the earth which is under them: for the heavens will go in flight like smoke, and the earth will become old like a coat, and its people will come to destruction like insects: but my salvation will be for ever, and my righteousness will not come to an end.";
B._Isa51_7="Give ear to me, you who have knowledge of righteousness, in whose heart is my law; have no fear of the evil words of men, and give no thought to their curses.";
B._Isa51_8="For like a coat they will be food for the insect, the worm will make a meal of them like wool: but my righteousness will be for ever, and my salvation to all generations.";
B._Isa51_9="Awake! awake! put on strength, O arm of the Lord, awake! as in the old days, in the generations long past. Was it not by you that Rahab was cut in two, and the dragon Wounded?";
B._Isa51_10="Did you not make the sea dry, the waters of the great deep? did you not make the deep waters of the sea a way for the Lord's people to go through?";
B._Isa51_11="Those whom the Lord has made free will come back with songs to Zion; and on their heads will be eternal joy: delight and joy will be theirs, and sorrow and sounds of grief will be gone for ever.";
B._Isa51_12="I, even I, am your comforter: are you so poor in heart as to be in fear of man who will come to an end, and of the son of man who will be like grass?";
B._Isa51_13="And you have given no thought to the Lord your Maker, by whom the heavens were stretched out, and the earth placed on its base; and you went all day in fear of the wrath of the cruel one, when he was making ready for your destruction. And where is the wrath of the cruel one?";
B._Isa51_14="The prisoner, bent under his chain, will quickly be made free, and will not go down into the underworld, and his bread will not come to an end.";
B._Isa51_15="For I am the Lord your God, who makes the sea calm when its waves are thundering: the Lord of armies is his name.";
B._Isa51_16="And I have put my words in your mouth, covering you with the shade of my hand, stretching out the heavens, and placing the earth on its base, and saying to Zion, You are my people.";
B._Isa51_17="Awake! awake! up! O Jerusalem, you who have taken from the Lord's hand the cup of his wrath; tasting in full measure the wine which overcomes.";
B._Isa51_18="She has no one among all her children to be her guide; not one of the sons she has taken care of takes her by the hand.";
B._Isa51_19="These two things have come on you; who will be weeping for you? wasting and destruction; death from need of food, and from the sword; how may you be comforted?";
B._Isa51_20="Your sons are overcome, like a roe in a net; they are full of the wrath of the Lord, the punishment of your God.";
B._Isa51_21="So now give ear to this, you who are troubled and overcome, but not with wine:";
B._Isa51_22="This is the word of the Lord your master, even your God who takes up the cause of his people: See, I have taken out of your hand the cup which overcomes, even the cup of my wrath; it will not again be given to you:";
B._Isa51_23="And I will put it into the hand of your cruel masters, and of those whose yoke has been hard on you; who have said to your soul, Down on your face! so that we may go over you: and you have given your backs like the earth, even like the street, for them to go over.";
B._Isa52_1="Awake! awake! put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful robes, O Jerusalem, the holy town: for from now there will never again come into you the unclean and those without circumcision.";
B._Isa52_2="Make yourself clean from the dust; up! and take the seat of your power, O Jerusalem: the bands of your neck are loose, O prisoned daughter of Zion.";
B._Isa52_3="For the Lord says, You were given for nothing, and you will be made free without price.";
B._Isa52_4="For the Lord God says, My people went down at first into Egypt, to get a place for themselves there: and the Assyrian put a cruel yoke on them without cause.";
B._Isa52_5="Now then, what have I here? says the Lord, for my people are taken away without cause; they are made waste and give cries of sorrow, says the Lord, and all the day the nations put shame on my name.";
B._Isa52_6="For this cause I will make my name clear to my people; in that day they will be certain that it is my word which comes to them; see, here am I.";
B._Isa52_7="How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who comes with good news, who gives word of peace, saying that salvation is near; who says to Zion, Your God is ruling!";
B._Isa52_8="The voice of your watchmen! their voices are loud in song together; for they will see him, eye to eye, when the Lord comes back to Zion.";
B._Isa52_9="Give sounds of joy, make melody together, waste places of Jerusalem: for the Lord has given comfort to his people, he has taken up the cause of Jerusalem.";
B._Isa52_10="The Lord has let his holy arm be seen by the eyes of all nations; and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.";
B._Isa52_11="Away! away! go out from there, touching no unclean thing; go out from among her; be clean, you who take up the vessels of the Lord.";
B._Isa52_12="For you will not go out suddenly, and you will not go in flight: for the Lord will go before you, and the God of Israel will come after you to keep you.";
B._Isa52_13="See, my servant will do well in his undertakings, he will be honoured, and lifted up, and be very high.";
B._Isa52_14="As peoples were surprised at him, And his face was not beautiful, so as to be desired: his face was so changed by disease as to be unlike that of a man, and his form was no longer that of the sons of men.";
B._Isa52_15="So will nations give him honour; kings will keep quiet because of him: for what had not been made clear to them they will see; and they will give their minds to what had not come to their ears.";
B._Isa53_1="Who would have had faith in the word which has come to our ears, and to whom had the arm of the Lord been unveiled?";
B._Isa53_2="For his growth was like that of a delicate plant before him, and like a root out of a dry place: he had no grace of form, to give us pleasure;";
B._Isa53_3="Men made sport of him, turning away from him; he was a man of sorrows, marked by disease; and like one from whom men's faces are turned away, he was looked down on, and we put no value on him.";
B._Isa53_4="But it was our pain he took, and our diseases were put on him: while to us he seemed as one diseased, on whom God's punishment had come.";
B._Isa53_5="But it was for our sins he was wounded, and for our evil doings he was crushed: he took the punishment by which we have peace, and by his wounds we are made well.";
B._Isa53_6="We all went wandering like sheep; going every one of us after his desire; and the Lord put on him the punishment of us all.";
B._Isa53_7="Men were cruel to him, but he was gentle and quiet; as a lamb taken to its death, and as a sheep before those who take her wool makes no sound, so he said not a word.";
B._Isa53_8="They took away from him help and right, and who gave a thought to his fate? for he was cut off from the land of the living: he came to his death for the sin of my people.";
B._Isa53_9="And they put his body into the earth with sinners, and his last resting-place was with the evil-doers, though he had done no wrong, and no deceit was in his mouth.";
B._Isa53_10="And the Lord was pleased ... see a seed, long life, ... will do well in his hand. ...";
B._Isa53_11="... made clear his righteousness before men ... had taken their sins on himself.";
B._Isa53_12="For this cause he will have a heritage with the great, and he will have a part in the goods of war with the strong, because he gave up his life, and was numbered with the evil-doers; taking on himself the sins of the people, and making prayer for the wrongdoers.";
B._Isa54_1="Let your voice be loud in song, O woman without children; make melody and sounds of joy, you who did not give birth: for the children of her who had no husband are more than those of the married wife, says the Lord.";
B._Isa54_2="Make wide the place of your tent, and let the curtains of your house be stretched out without limit: make your cords long, and your tent-pins strong.";
B._Isa54_3="For I will make wide your limits on the right hand and on the left; and your seed will take the nations for a heritage, and make the waste towns full of people.";
B._Isa54_4="Have no fear; for you will not be shamed or without hope: you will not be put to shame, for the shame of your earlier days will go out of your memory, and you will no longer keep in mind the sorrows of your widowed years.";
B._Isa54_5="For your Maker is your husband; the Lord of armies is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is he who takes up your cause; he will be named the God of all the earth.";
B._Isa54_6="For the Lord has made you come back to him, like a wife who has been sent away in grief of spirit; for one may not give up the wife of one's early days.";
B._Isa54_7="For a short time I gave you up; but with great mercies I will take you back again.";
B._Isa54_8="In overflowing wrath my face was veiled from you for a minute, but I will have pity on you for ever, says the Lord who takes up your cause.";
B._Isa54_9="For this is like the days of Noah to me: for as I took an oath that the waters of Noah would never again go over the earth, so have I taken an oath that I will not again be angry with you, or say bitter words to you.";
B._Isa54_10="For the mountains may be taken away, and the hills be moved out of their places, but my love will not be taken from you, or my agreement of peace broken, says the Lord, who has had mercy on you.";
B._Isa54_11="O troubled one, storm-crushed, uncomforted! see, your stones will be framed in fair colours, and your bases will be sapphires.";
B._Isa54_12="I will make your towers of rubies, and your doors of carbuncles, and the wall round you will be of all sorts of beautiful stones.";
B._Isa54_13="And all your builders will be made wise by the Lord; and great will be the peace of your children.";
B._Isa54_14="All your rights will be made certain to you: have no fear of evil, and destruction will not come near you.";
B._Isa54_15="See, they may be moved to war, but not by my authority: all those who come together to make an attack on you, will be broken against you.";
B._Isa54_16="See, I have made the iron-worker, blowing on the burning coals, and making the instrument of war by his work; and I have made the waster for destruction.";
B._Isa54_17="No instrument of war which is formed against you will be of any use; and every tongue which says evil against you will be judged false. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness comes from me, says the Lord.";
B._Isa55_1="Ho! everyone in need, come to the waters, and he who has no strength, let him get food: come, get bread without money; wine and milk without price.";
B._Isa55_2="Why do you give your money for what is not bread, and the fruit of your work for what will not give you pleasure? Give ear to me, so that your food may be good, and you may have the best in full measure.";
B._Isa55_3="Give ear, and come to me, take note with care, so that your souls may have life: and I will make an eternal agreement with you, even the certain mercies of David.";
B._Isa55_4="See, I have given him as a witness to the peoples, a ruler and a guide to the nations.";
B._Isa55_5="See, you will send for a nation of which you had no knowledge, and those who had no knowledge of you will come running to you, because of the Lord your God, and because of the Holy One of Israel, for he has given you glory.";
B._Isa55_6="Make search for the Lord while he is there, make prayer to him while he is near:";
B._Isa55_7="Let the sinner give up his way, and the evil-doer his purpose: and let him come back to the Lord, and he will have mercy on him; and to our God, for there is full forgiveness with him.";
B._Isa55_8="For my thoughts are not your thoughts, or your ways my ways, says the Lord.";
B._Isa55_9="For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.";
B._Isa55_10="For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and does not go back again, but gives water to the earth, and makes it fertile, giving seed to the planter, and bread for food;";
B._Isa55_11="So will my word be which goes out of my mouth: it will not come back to me with nothing done, but it will give effect to my purpose, and do that for which I have sent it.";
B._Isa55_12="For you will go out with joy, and be guided in peace: the mountains and the hills will make melody before you, and all the trees of the fields will make sounds of joy.";
B._Isa55_13="In place of the thorn will come up the fir-tree, and in place of the blackberry the myrtle: and it will be to the Lord for a name, for an eternal sign which will not be cut off.";
B._Isa56_1="The Lord says, Let your way of life be upright, and let your behaviour be rightly ordered: for my salvation is near, and my righteousness will quickly be seen.";
B._Isa56_2="Happy is the man who does this, and the son of man whose behaviour is so ordered; who keeps the Sabbath holy, and his hand from doing any evil.";
B._Isa56_3="And let not the man from a strange country, who has been joined to the Lord, say, The Lord will certainly put a division between me and his people: and let not the unsexed man say, See, I am a dry tree.";
B._Isa56_4="For the Lord says, As for the unsexed who keep my Sabbaths, and give their hearts to pleasing me, and keep their agreement with me:";
B._Isa56_5="I will give to them in my house, and inside my walls, a place and a name better than that of sons and daughters; I will give them an eternal name which will not be cut off.";
B._Isa56_6="And as for those from a strange country, who are joined to the Lord, to give worship to him and honour to his name, to be his servants, even everyone who keeps the Sabbath holy, and keeps his agreement with me:";
B._Isa56_7="I will make them come to my holy mountain, and will give them joy in my house of prayer; I will take pleasure in the burned offerings which they make on my altar: for my house will be named a house of prayer for all peoples.";
B._Isa56_8="The Lord God, who gets together the wandering ones of Israel, says, I will get together others in addition to those of Israel who have come back.";
B._Isa56_9="All you beasts of the field, come together for your meat, even all you beasts of the wood.";
B._Isa56_10="His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all dogs without tongues, unable to make a sound; stretched out dreaming, loving sleep.";
B._Isa56_11="Yes, the dogs are for ever looking for food; while these, the keepers of the sheep, are without wisdom: they have all gone after their pleasure, every one looking for profit; they are all the same.";
B._Isa56_12="Come, they say, I will get wine, and we will take strong drink in full measure; and tomorrow will be like today, full of pleasure.";
B._Isa57_1="The upright man goes to his death, and no one gives a thought to it; and god-fearing men are taken away, and no one is troubled by it; for the upright man is taken away because of evil-doing, and goes into peace.";
B._Isa57_2="They are at rest in their last resting-places, every one going straight before him.";
B._Isa57_3="But come near, you sons of her who is wise in secret arts, the seed of her who is false to her husband, and of the loose woman.";
B._Isa57_4="Of whom do you make sport? against whom is your mouth open wide and your tongue put out? are you not uncontrolled children, a false seed,";
B._Isa57_5="You who are burning with evil desire among the oaks, under every green tree; putting children to death in the valleys, under the cracks of the rocks?";
B._Isa57_6="Among the smooth stones of the valley is your heritage; they, even they, are your part: even to them have you made a drink offering and a meal offering. Is it possible for such things to be overlooked by me?";
B._Isa57_7="You have put your bed on a high mountain: there you went up to make your offering.";
B._Isa57_8="And on the back of the doors and on the pillars you have put your sign: for you have been false to me with another; you have made your bed wide, and made an agreement with them; you had a desire for their bed where you saw it";
B._Isa57_9="And you went to Melech with oil and much perfume, and you sent your representatives far off, and went as low as the underworld.";
B._Isa57_10="You were tired with your long journeys; but you did not say, There is no hope: you got new strength, and so you were not feeble.";
B._Isa57_11="And of whom were you in fear, so that you were false, and did not keep me in mind, or give thought to it? Have I not been quiet, keeping myself secret, and so you were not in fear of me?";
B._Isa57_12="I will make clear what your righteousness is like and your works; you will have no profit in them.";
B._Isa57_13="Your false gods will not keep you safe in answer to your cry; but the wind will take them, they will be gone like a breath: but he who puts his hope in me will take the land, and will have my holy mountain as his heritage.";
B._Isa57_14="And I will say, Make it high, make it high, get ready the way, take the stones out of the way of my people.";
B._Isa57_15="For this is the word of him who is high and lifted up, whose resting-place is eternal, whose name is Holy: my resting-place is in the high and holy place, and with him who is crushed and poor in spirit, to give life to the spirit of the poor, and to make strong the heart of the crushed.";
B._Isa57_16="For I will not give punishment for ever, or be angry without end: for from me breath goes out; and I it was who made the souls.";
B._Isa57_17="I was quickly angry with his evil ways, and sent punishment on him, veiling my face in wrath: and he went on, turning his heart from me.";
B._Isa57_18="I have seen his ways, and I will make him well: I will give him rest, comforting him and his people who are sad.";
B._Isa57_19="I will give the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is near and to him who is far off, says the Lord; and I will make him well.";
