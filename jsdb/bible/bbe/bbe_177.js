B._Heb10_2="For if this had been possible, would there not have been an end of those offerings, because the worshippers would have been made completely clean and would have been no longer conscious of sins?";
B._Heb10_3="But year by year there is a memory of sins in those offerings.";
B._Heb10_4="Because it is not possible for the blood of oxen and goats to take away sins.";
B._Heb10_5="So that when he comes into the world, he says, You had no desire for offerings, but you made a body ready for me;";
B._Heb10_6="You had no joy in burned offerings or in offerings for sin.";
B._Heb10_7="Then I said, See, I have come to do your pleasure, O God (as it is said of me in the roll of the book).";
B._Heb10_8="After saying, You had no desire for offerings, for burned offerings or offerings for sin (which are made by the law) and you had no pleasure in them,";
B._Heb10_9="Then he said, See, I have come to do your pleasure. He took away the old order, so that he might put the new order in its place.";
B._Heb10_10="By that pleasure we have been made holy, by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for ever.";
B._Heb10_11="And every priest takes his place at the altar day by day, doing what is necessary, and making again and again the same offerings which are never able to take away sins.";
B._Heb10_12="But when Jesus had made one offering for sins for ever, he took his place at the right hand of God;";
B._Heb10_13="And has been waiting there from that time, till all who are against him are made a foot-rest for his feet.";
B._Heb10_14="Because by one offering he has made complete for ever those who are made holy.";
B._Heb10_15="And the Holy Spirit is a witness for us: for after he had said,";
B._Heb10_16="This is the agreement which I will make with them after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws in their hearts, writing them in their minds; he said,";
B._Heb10_17="And I will keep no more memory of their sins and of their evil-doings.";
B._Heb10_18="Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no more offering for sin.";
B._Heb10_19="So then, my brothers, being able to go into the holy place without fear, because of the blood of Jesus,";
B._Heb10_20="By the new and living way which he made open for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;";
B._Heb10_21="And having a great priest over the house of God,";
B._Heb10_22="Let us go in with true hearts, in certain faith, having our hearts made free from the sense of sin and our bodies washed with clean water:";
B._Heb10_23="Let us keep the witness of our hope strong and unshaking, for he is true who has given his word:";
B._Heb10_24="And let us be moving one another at all times to love and good works;";
B._Heb10_25="Not giving up our meetings, as is the way of some, but keeping one another strong in faith; and all the more because you see the day coming near.";
B._Heb10_26="For if we do evil on purpose after we have had the knowledge of what is true, there is no more offering for sins,";
B._Heb10_27="But only a great fear of being judged, and of the fire of wrath which will be the destruction of the haters of God.";
B._Heb10_28="A man who has gone against the law of Moses is put to death without pity on the word of two or three witnesses:";
B._Heb10_29="But will not the man by whom the Son of God has been crushed under foot, and the blood of the agreement with which he was washed clean has been taken as an unholy thing, and who has had no respect for the Spirit of grace, be judged bad enough for a very much worse punishment?";
B._Heb10_30="For we have had experience of him who says, Punishment is mine, I will give reward. And again, The Lord will be judge of his people.";
B._Heb10_31="We may well go in fear of falling into the hands of the living God.";
B._Heb10_32="But give thought to the days after you had seen the light, when you went through a great war of troubles;";
B._Heb10_33="In part, in being attacked by angry words and cruel acts, before the eyes of everyone, and in part, in being united with those who were attacked in this way.";
B._Heb10_34="For you had pity on those who were in prison, and had joy in the loss of your property, in the knowledge that you still had a better property and one which you would keep for ever.";
B._Heb10_35="So do not give up your hope which will be greatly rewarded.";
B._Heb10_36="For, having done what was right in God's eyes, you have need of waiting before his word has effect for you.";
B._Heb10_37="In a very little time he who is coming will come; he will not be slow.";
B._Heb10_38="But the upright man will be living by his faith; and if he goes back, my soul will have no pleasure in him.";
B._Heb10_39="But we are not of those who go back to destruction; but of those who have faith even to the salvation of the soul.";
B._Heb11_1="Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the sign that the things not seen are true.";
B._Heb11_2="For by it our fathers had God's approval.";
B._Heb11_3="By faith it is clear to us that the order of events was fixed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made from things which only seem to be.";
B._Heb11_4="By faith Abel made a better offering to God than Cain, and he had witness through it of his righteousness, God giving his approval of his offering: and his voice still comes to us through it though he is dead.";
B._Heb11_5="By faith Enoch was taken up to heaven so that he did not see death; he was seen no longer, for God took him away: for before he was taken, witness had been given that he was well-pleasing to God:";
B._Heb11_6="And without faith it is not possible to be well-pleasing to him, for it is necessary for anyone who comes to God to have the belief that God is, and that he is a rewarder of all those who make a serious search for him.";
B._Heb11_7="By faith Noah, being moved by the fear of God, made ready an ark for the salvation of his family, because God had given him news of things which were not seen at the time; and through it the world was judged by him, and he got for his heritage the righteousness which is by faith.";
B._Heb11_8="By faith Abraham did as God said when he was ordered to go out into a place which was to be given to him as a heritage, and went out without knowledge of where he was going.";
B._Heb11_9="By faith he was a wanderer in the land of the agreement, as in a strange land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who had a part with him in the same heritage:";
B._Heb11_10="For he was looking for the strong town, whose builder and maker is God.";
B._Heb11_11="And by faith Sarah herself had power to give birth, when she was very old, because she had faith in him who gave his word;";
B._Heb11_12="So that from one man, who was near to death, came children in number as the stars in heaven, or as the sand by the seaside, which may not be numbered.";
B._Heb11_13="All these came to their end in faith, not having had the heritage; but having seen it with delight far away, they gave witness that they were wanderers and not of the earth.";
B._Heb11_14="For those who say such things make it clear that they are searching for a country for themselves.";
B._Heb11_15="And truly if they had kept in mind the country from which they went out, they would have had chances of turning back.";
B._Heb11_16="But now their desire is for a better country, that is to say, for one in heaven; and so it is no shame to God to be named their God; for he has made ready a town for them.";
B._Heb11_17="By faith Abraham made an offering of Isaac, when he was tested: and he with whom the agreement had been made gave up as an offering the only son of his body,";
B._Heb11_18="Of whom it had been said, From Isaac will your seed take their name:";
B._Heb11_19="Judging that God was able to give life even to the dead; and because of this he did get him back as if from death.";
B._Heb11_20="By faith Isaac, blessing Jacob and Esau, gave news of things to come.";
B._Heb11_21="By faith Jacob gave a blessing to the two sons of Joseph, when he was near to death; and gave God worship, supported by his stick.";
B._Heb11_22="By faith Joseph, when his end was near, said that the children of Israel would go out of Egypt; and gave orders about his bones.";
B._Heb11_23="By faith Moses was kept secretly by his father and mother for three months after his birth, because they saw that he was a fair child; and they had no fear of the king's orders.";
B._Heb11_24="By faith Moses, when he became a man, had no desire to be named the son of Pharaoh's daughter;";
B._Heb11_25="Feeling that it was better to undergo pain with the people of God, than for a short time to have a taste of the pleasures of sin;";
B._Heb11_26="Judging a part in the shame of Christ to be better than all the wealth of Egypt; for he was looking forward to his reward.";
B._Heb11_27="By faith he went out of Egypt, not being turned from his purpose by fear of the wrath of the king; for he kept on his way, as seeing him who is unseen.";
B._Heb11_28="By faith he kept the Passover, and put the sign of the blood on the houses, so that the angel of destruction might not put their oldest sons to death.";
B._Heb11_29="By faith they went through the Red Sea as if it had been dry land, though the Egyptians were overcome by the water when they made an attempt to do the same.";
B._Heb11_30="By faith the walls of Jericho came down, after they had been circled for seven days.";
B._Heb11_31="By faith Rahab, the loose woman, was not put to death with those who had gone against God's orders, because she had taken into her house in peace those sent to see the land.";
B._Heb11_32="What more am I to say? For there would not be time to give the stories of Gideon, Barak, Samson, and Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets:";
B._Heb11_33="Who through faith overcame kingdoms, did righteousness, got their reward, kept the mouths of lions shut,";
B._Heb11_34="Put out the power of fire, got safely away from the edge of the sword, were made strong when they had been feeble, became full of power in war, and put to flight the armies of the nations.";
B._Heb11_35="Women had their dead given back to them living; others let themselves be cruelly attacked, having no desire to go free, so that they might have a better life to come;";
B._Heb11_36="And others were tested by being laughed at or by blows, and even with chains and prisons:";
B._Heb11_37="They were stoned, they were cut up with knives, they were tested, they were put to death with the sword, they went about in sheepskins and in goatskins; being poor and in pain and cruelly attacked,";
B._Heb11_38="Wandering in waste places and in mountains and in holes in the rocks; for whom the world was not good enough.";
B._Heb11_39="And not one of these got the good things of the agreement, though they all had a good record through faith,";
B._Heb11_40="Because God had kept some better thing for us, so that it was not possible for them to become complete without us.";
B._Heb12_1="For this reason, as we are circled by so great a cloud of witnesses, putting off every weight, and the sin into which we come so readily, let us keep on running in the way which is marked out for us,";
B._Heb12_2="Having our eyes fixed on Jesus, the guide and end of our faith, who went through the pains of the cross, not caring for the shame, because of the joy which was before him, and who has now taken his place at the right hand of God's seat of power.";
B._Heb12_3="Give thought to him who has undergone so much of the hate of sinners against himself, so that you may not be tired and feeble of purpose.";
B._Heb12_4="Till now you have not given your blood in your fight against sin:";
B._Heb12_5="And you have not kept in mind the word which says to you as to sons, My son, do not make little of the Lord's punishment, and do not give up hope when you are judged by him;";
B._Heb12_6="For the Lord sends punishment on his loved ones; everyone whom he takes as his son has experience of his rod.";
B._Heb12_7="It is for your training that you undergo these things; God is acting to you as a father does to his sons; for what son does not have punishment from his father?";
B._Heb12_8="But if you have not that punishment of which we all have our part, then you are not true sons, but children of shame.";
B._Heb12_9="And again, if the fathers of our flesh gave us punishment and had our respect, how much more will we be under the authority of the Father of spirits, and have life?";
B._Heb12_10="For they truly gave us punishment for a short time, as it seemed good to them; but he does it for our profit, so that we may become holy as he is.";
B._Heb12_11="At the time all punishment seems to be pain and not joy: but after, those who have been trained by it get from it the peace-giving fruit of righteousness.";
B._Heb12_12="For this cause let the hands which are hanging down be lifted up, and let the feeble knees be made strong,";
B._Heb12_13="And make straight roads for your feet, so that the feeble may not be turned out of the way, but may be made strong.";
B._Heb12_14="Let your desire be for peace with all men, and to be made holy, without which no man may see the Lord;";
B._Heb12_15="Looking with care to see that no man among you in his behaviour comes short of the grace of God; for fear that some bitter root may come up to be a trouble to you, and that some of you may be made unclean by it;";
B._Heb12_16="And that there may not be any evil liver, or any man without respect for God, like Esau, who let his birthright go for a plate of food.";
B._Heb12_17="For you have knowledge that even long after, when he was desiring the blessing for his heritage, he was turned away, though he made his request frequently and with weeping; because the past might not be changed.";
B._Heb12_18="You have not come to a mountain which may be touched, and is burning with fire, and to a black cloud, and a dark smoke, and a violent wind,";
B._Heb12_19="And to the sound of a horn, and the voice of words, the hearers of which made request that not a word more might be said to them:";
B._Heb12_20="For the order which said, If the mountain is touched even by a beast, the beast is to be stoned, seemed hard to them;";
B._Heb12_21="And the vision was so overpowering that even Moses said, I am shaking and full of fear.";
B._Heb12_22="But you have come to the mountain of Zion, to the place of the living God, to the Jerusalem which is in heaven, and to an army of angels which may not be numbered,";
B._Heb12_23="To the great meeting and church of the first of those who are named in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of good men made complete,";
B._Heb12_24="And to Jesus by whom the new agreement has been made between God and man, and to the sign of the blood which says better things than Abel's blood.";
B._Heb12_25="See that you give ear to his voice which comes to you. For if those whose ears were shut to the voice which came to them on earth did not go free from punishment, what chance have we of going free if we give no attention to him whose voice comes from heaven?";
B._Heb12_26="Whose voice was the cause of the shaking of the earth; but now he has made an oath, saying, There will be still one more shaking, not only of the earth, but of heaven.";
B._Heb12_27="And the words, Still one more, make it clear that there will be a taking away of those things which are shaking, as of things which are made, so that there may be only those things of which no shaking is possible.";
B._Heb12_28="If then, we have a kingdom which will never be moved, let us have grace, so that we may give God such worship as is pleasing to him with fear and respect:";
B._Heb12_29="For our God is an all-burning fire.";
B._Heb13_1="Go on loving your brothers in the faith.";
B._Heb13_2="Take care to keep open house: because in this way some have had angels as their guests, without being conscious of it.";
B._Heb13_3="Keep in mind those who are in chains, as if you were chained with them, and those who are in trouble, as being yourselves in the body.";
B._Heb13_4="Let married life be honoured among all of you and not made unclean; for men untrue in married life will be judged by God.";
B._Heb13_5="Be free from the love of money and pleased with the things which you have; for he himself has said, I will be with you at all times.";
B._Heb13_6="So that we say with a good heart, The Lord is my helper; I will have no fear: what is man able to do to me?";
B._Heb13_7="Keep in mind those who were over you, and who gave you the word of God; seeing the outcome of their way of life, let your faith be like theirs.";
B._Heb13_8="Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever.";
B._Heb13_9="Do not be turned away by different strange teachings, because it is good for your hearts to be made strong by grace, and not by meats, which were of no profit to those who took so much trouble over them.";
B._Heb13_10="We have an altar from which those priests who are servants in the Tent may not take food.";
B._Heb13_11="For the bodies of the beasts whose blood is taken into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin are burned outside the circle of the tents.";
B._Heb13_12="For this reason Jesus was put to death outside the walls, so that he might make the people holy by his blood.";
B._Heb13_13="Let us then go out to him outside the circle of the tents, taking his shame on ourselves.";
B._Heb13_14="For here we have no fixed resting-place, but our search is for the one which is to come.";
B._Heb13_15="Let us then make offerings of praise to God at all times through him, that is to say, the fruit of lips giving witness to his name.";
B._Heb13_16="But go on doing good and giving to others, because God is well-pleased with such offerings.";
B._Heb13_17="Give ear to those who are rulers over you, and do as they say: for they keep watch over your souls, ready to give an account of them; let them be able to do this with joy and not with grief, because that would be of no profit to you.";
B._Heb13_18="Make prayers for us, for we are certain that our hearts are free from the sense of sin, desiring the right way of life in all things.";
B._Heb13_19="I make this request more strongly, in the hope of coming back to you more quickly.";
B._Heb13_20="Now may the God of peace, who made that great keeper of his flock, even our Lord Jesus, come back from the dead through the blood of the eternal agreement,";
B._Heb13_21="Make you full of every good work and ready to do all his desires, working in us whatever is pleasing in his eyes through Jesus Christ; and may the glory be given to him for ever and ever. So be it.";
B._Heb13_22="But, brothers, take kindly the words which I have said for your profit; for I have not sent you a long letter.";
B._Heb13_23="Our brother Timothy has been let out of prison; and if he comes here in a short time, he and I will come to you together.";
B._Heb13_24="Give words of love from me to those who are rulers over you, and to all the saints. Those who are in Italy send you their love.";
B._Heb13_25="May grace be with you all.";
B._Jas1_1="James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, sends words of love to the twelve tribes of the Jews living in all parts of the earth.";
B._Jas1_2="Let it be all joy to you, my brothers, when you undergo tests of every sort;";
B._Jas1_3="Because you have the knowledge that the testing of your faith gives you the power of going on in hope;";
B._Jas1_4="But let this power have its full effect, so that you may be made complete, needing nothing.";
B._Jas1_5="But if any man among you is without wisdom, let him make his request to God, who gives freely to all without an unkind word, and it will be given to him.";
B._Jas1_6="Let him make his request in faith, doubting nothing; for he who has doubt in his heart is like the waves of the sea, which are troubled by the driving of the wind.";
B._Jas1_7="Let it not seem to such a man that he will get anything from the Lord;";
B._Jas1_8="For there is a division in his mind, and he is uncertain in all his ways.";
B._Jas1_9="But let the brother of low position be glad that he is lifted up;";
B._Jas1_10="But the man of wealth, that he is made low; because like the flower of the grass he will come to his end.";
B._Jas1_11="For when the sun comes up with its burning heat, the grass gets dry and the grace of its form is gone with the falling flower; so the man of wealth comes to nothing in his ways.";
B._Jas1_12="There is a blessing on the man who undergoes testing; because, if he has God's approval, he will be given the crown of life, which the Lord has said he will give to those who have love for him.";
B._Jas1_13="Let no man say when he is tested, I am tested by God; for it is not possible for God to be tested by evil, and he himself puts no man to such a test:";
B._Jas1_14="But every man is tested when he is turned out of the right way by the attraction of his desire.";
B._Jas1_15="Then when its time comes, desire gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is of full growth, gives birth to death.";
B._Jas1_16="Do not be turned from the right way, dear brothers.";
B._Jas1_17="Every good and true thing is given to us from heaven, coming from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change or any shade made by turning.";
B._Jas1_18="Of his purpose he gave us being, by his true word, so that we might be, in a sense, the first-fruits of all the things which he had made.";
B._Jas1_19="You have knowledge of this, dear brothers. But let every man be quick in hearing, slow in words, slow to get angry;";
B._Jas1_20="For the righteousness of God does not come about by the wrath of man.";
B._Jas1_21="For this reason, putting away all dirty behaviour and the overweight of evil, take into your souls without pride the word which, being planted there, is able to give you salvation.";
B._Jas1_22="But be doers of the word, and not only hearers of it, blinding yourselves with false ideas.";
B._Jas1_23="Because if any man is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a glass;";
B._Jas1_24="For after looking at himself he goes away, and in a short time he has no memory of what he was like.";
B._Jas1_25="But he who goes on looking into the true law which makes him free, being not a hearer without memory but a doer putting it into effect, this man will have a blessing on his acts.";
B._Jas1_26="If a man seems to have religion and has no control over his tongue but lets himself be tricked by what is false, this man's religion is of no value.";
B._Jas1_27="The religion which is holy and free from evil in the eyes of our God and Father is this: to take care of children who have no fathers and of widows who are in trouble, and to keep oneself untouched by the world.";
B._Jas2_1="My brothers, if you have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory, do not take a man's position into account.";
B._Jas2_2="For if a man comes into your Synagogue in fair clothing and with a gold ring, and a poor man comes in with dirty clothing,";
B._Jas2_3="And you do honour to the man in fair clothing and say, Come here and take this good place; and you say to the poor man, Take up your position there, or be seated at my feet;";
B._Jas2_4="Is there not a division in your minds? have you not become judges with evil thoughts?";
B._Jas2_5="Give ear, my dear brothers; are not those who are poor in the things of this world marked out by God to have faith as their wealth, and for their heritage the kingdom which he has said he will give to those who have love for him?";
B._Jas2_6="But you have put the poor man to shame. Are not the men of wealth rulers over you? do they not take you by force before their judges?";
B._Jas2_7="Do they not say evil of the holy name which was given to you?";
B._Jas2_8="But if you keep the greatest law of all, as it is given in the holy Writings, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself, you do well:";
B._Jas2_9="But if you take a man's position into account, you do evil, and are judged as evil-doers by the law.";
B._Jas2_10="For anyone who keeps all the law, but makes a slip in one point, is judged to have gone against it all.";
B._Jas2_11="For he who said, Do not be untrue in married life, is the same who said, Put no man to death. Now if you are not untrue in married life, but you put a man to death, the law is broken.";
B._Jas2_12="Let your words and your acts be those of men who are to be judged by the law which makes free.";
B._Jas2_13="For the man who has had no mercy will be judged without mercy, but mercy takes pride in overcoming judging.";
B._Jas2_14="What use is it, my brothers, for a man to say that he has faith, if he does nothing? will such a faith give him salvation?";
B._Jas2_15="If a brother or a sister is without clothing and in need of the day's food,";
B._Jas2_16="And one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warm and full of food; but you do not give them the things of which their bodies have need, what profit is there in this?";
B._Jas2_17="Even so faith without works is dead.";
B._Jas2_18="But a man may say, You have faith and I have works; let me see your faith without your works, and I will make my faith clear to you by my works.";
