B._Eze8_15="Then he said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? you will see even more disgusting things than these.";
B._Eze8_16="And he took me into the inner square of the Lord's house, and at the door of the Temple of the Lord, between the covered way and the altar, there were about twenty-five men with their backs turned to the Temple of the Lord and their faces turned to the east; and they were worshipping the sun, turning to the east.";
B._Eze8_17="Then he said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? is it a small thing to the children of Judah that they do the disgusting things which they are doing here? for they have made the land full of violent behaviour, making me angry again and again: and see, they put the branch to my nose.";
B._Eze8_18="For this reason I will let loose my wrath: my eye will not have mercy, and I will have no pity.";
B._Eze9_1="Then crying out in my hearing in a loud voice, he said, Let the overseers of the town come near, every man armed.";
B._Eze9_2="And six men came from the way of the higher doorway looking to the north, every man with his axe in his hand: and one man among them was clothed in linen, with a writer's inkpot at his side. And they went in and took their places by the brass altar.";
B._Eze9_3="And the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the winged ones on which it was resting, to the doorstep of the house. And crying out to the man clothed in linen who had the writer's inkpot at his side,";
B._Eze9_4="The Lord said to him, Go through the town, through the middle of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the brows of the men who are sorrowing and crying for all the disgusting things which are done in it.";
B._Eze9_5="And to these he said in my hearing, Go through the town after him using your axes: do not let your eyes have mercy, and have no pity:";
B._Eze9_6="Give up to destruction old men and young men and virgins, little children and women: but do not come near any man who has the mark on him: and make a start at my holy place. So they made a start with the old men who were before the house.";
B._Eze9_7="And he said to them, Make the house unclean, make the open places full of dead: go forward and send destruction on the town.";
B._Eze9_8="Now while they were doing so, and I was untouched, I went down on my face, and crying out, I said, Ah, Lord! will you give all the rest of Israel to destruction in letting loose your wrath on Jerusalem?";
B._Eze9_9="Then he said to me, The sin of the children of Israel and Judah is very, very great, and the land is full of blood and the town full of evil ways: for they say, The Lord has gone away from the land, and the Lord does not see.";
B._Eze9_10="And as for me, my eye will not have mercy, and I will have no pity, but I will send the punishment of their ways on their heads.";
B._Eze9_11="Then the man clothed in linen, who had the inkpot at his side, came back and said, I have done what you gave me orders to do.";
B._Eze10_1="Then looking, I saw that on the arch which was over the head of the winged ones there was seen over them what seemed like a sapphire stone, having the form of a king's seat.";
B._Eze10_2="And he said to the man clothed in linen, Go in between the wheels, under the winged ones, and get your two hands full of burning coals from between the winged ones and send them in a shower over the town. And he went in before my eyes.";
B._Eze10_3="Now the winged ones were stationed on the right side of the house when the man went in; and the inner square was full of the cloud.";
B._Eze10_4="And the glory of the Lord went up from the winged ones and came to rest over the doorstep of the house; and the house was full of the cloud and the open square was full of the shining of the Lord's glory.";
B._Eze10_5="And the sound of the wings of the winged ones was clear even in the outer square, like the voice of the Ruler of all.";
B._Eze10_6="And when he gave orders to the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the winged ones, then he went in and took his place at the side of a wheel.";
B._Eze10_7="And stretching out his hand to the fire which was between the winged ones, he took some of it and went out.";
B._Eze10_8="And I saw the form of a man's hands among the winged ones under their wings.";
B._Eze10_9="And looking, I saw four wheels by the side of the winged ones, one wheel by the side of a winged one and another wheel by the side of another: and the wheels were like the colour of a beryl stone to the eye.";
B._Eze10_10="In form the four of them were all the same, they seemed like a wheel inside a wheel.";
B._Eze10_11="When they were moving, they went on their four sides without turning; they went after the head in the direction in which it was looking; they went without turning.";
B._Eze10_12="And the edges of the four wheels were full of eyes round about.";
B._Eze10_13="As for the wheels, they were named in my hearing, the circling wheels.";
B._Eze10_14="And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a winged one, and the second was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.";
B._Eze10_15="And the winged ones went up on high: this is the living being which I saw by the river Chebar.";
B._Eze10_16="And when the winged ones went, the wheels went by their side: and when their wings were lifted to take them up from the earth, the wheels were not turned from their side.";
B._Eze10_17="When they were at rest in their place, these were at rest; when they were lifted up, these went up with them: for the spirit of life was in them.";
B._Eze10_18="Then the glory of the Lord went out from the doorstep of the house, and came to rest over the winged ones.";
B._Eze10_19="And the winged ones, lifting up their wings, went up from the earth before my eyes, with the wheels by their side: and they came to rest at the east doorway of the Lord's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them on high.";
B._Eze10_20="This is the living being which I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and it was clear to me that they were the winged ones.";
B._Eze10_21="Every one had four faces and every one had four wings; and hands like a man's hands were under their wings.";
B._Eze10_22="As for the form of their faces, they were the faces whose form I saw by the river Chebar; when they went, every one of them went straight forward.";
B._Eze11_1="And the wind, lifting me up, took me to the east doorway of the Lord's house, looking to the east: and at the door I saw twenty-five men; and among them I saw Jaazaniah, the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah, the son of Benaiah, rulers of the people.";
B._Eze11_2="Then he said to me, Son of man, these are the men who are designing evil, who are teaching evil ways in this town:";
B._Eze11_3="Who say, This is not the time for building houses: this town is the cooking-pot and we are the flesh.";
B._Eze11_4="For this cause be a prophet against them, be a prophet, O son of man.";
B._Eze11_5="And the spirit of the Lord came on me, and he said to me, Say, These are the words of the Lord: This is what you have said, O children of Israel; what comes into your mind is clear to me.";
B._Eze11_6="You have made great the number of your dead in this town, you have made its streets full of dead men.";
B._Eze11_7="For this reason the Lord has said: Your dead whom you have put down in its streets, they are the flesh, and this town is the cooking-pot: but I will make you come out from inside it.";
B._Eze11_8="You have been fearing the sword, and I will send the sword on you, says the Lord.";
B._Eze11_9="I will make you come out from inside the town and will give you up into the hands of men from other lands, and will be judge among you.";
B._Eze11_10="You will come to your death by the sword; and I will be your judge in the land of Israel; and you will be certain that I am the Lord.";
B._Eze11_11="This town will not be your cooking-pot, and you will not be the flesh inside it; I will be your judge at the limit of the land of Israel;";
B._Eze11_12="And you will be certain that I am the Lord: for you have not been guided by my rules or given effect to my orders, but you have been living by the orders of the nations round about you.";
B._Eze11_13="Now while I was saying these things, death came to Pelatiah, the son of Benaiah. Then falling down on my face and crying out with a loud voice, I said, Ah, Lord! will you put an end to all the rest of Israel?";
B._Eze11_14="And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze11_15="Son of man, your countrymen, your relations, and all the children of Israel, all of them, are those to whom the people of Jerusalem have said, Go far from the Lord; this land is given to us for a heritage:";
B._Eze11_16="For this reason say, This is what the Lord has said: Though I have had them moved far off among the nations, and though I have sent them wandering among the countries, still I have been a safe place for them for a little time in the countries where they have come.";
B._Eze11_17="Then say, This is what the Lord has said: I will get you together from the peoples, and make you come out of the countries where you have been sent in flight, and I will give you the land of Israel.";
B._Eze11_18="And they will come there, and take away all the hated and disgusting things from it.";
B._Eze11_19="And I will give them a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in them; and I will take the heart of stone out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh:";
B._Eze11_20="So that they may be guided by my rules and keep my orders and do them: and they will be to me a people, and I will be to them a God.";
B._Eze11_21="But as for those whose heart goes after their hated and disgusting things, I will send on their heads the punishment of their ways, says the Lord.";
B._Eze11_22="Then the wings of the winged ones were lifted up, and the wheels were by their side; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them on high.";
B._Eze11_23="And the glory of the Lord went up from inside the town, and came to rest on the mountain on the east side of the town.";
B._Eze11_24="And the wind, lifting me up, took me in the visions of God into Chaldaea, to those who had been taken away as prisoners. So the vision which I had seen went away from me.";
B._Eze11_25="Then I gave an account to those who had been taken prisoners of all the things which the Lord had made me see.";
B._Eze12_1="And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze12_2="Son of man, you are living among an uncontrolled people, who have eyes to see but see not, and ears for hearing but they do not give ear; for they are an uncontrolled people.";
B._Eze12_3="And you, O son of man, by day, before their eyes, get ready the vessels of one who is taken away, and go away from your place to another place before their eyes: it may be that they will see, though they are an uncontrolled people.";
B._Eze12_4="By day, before their eyes, take out your vessels like those of one who is taken away: and go out in the evening before their eyes, like those who are taken away as prisoners.";
B._Eze12_5="Make a hole in the wall, before their eyes, and go out through it.";
B._Eze12_6="And before their eyes, take your goods on your back and go out in the dark; go with your face covered: for I have made you a sign to the children of Israel.";
B._Eze12_7="And I did as I was ordered: I took out my vessels by day, like those of one who is taken away, and in the evening I made a hole through the wall with a tent-pin; and in the dark I went out, taking my things on my back before their eyes.";
B._Eze12_8="And in the morning the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze12_9="Son of man, has not Israel, the uncontrolled people, said to you, What are you doing?";
B._Eze12_10="You are to say to them, This is what the Lord has said: This word has to do with the ruler in Jerusalem and all the children of Israel in it.";
B._Eze12_11="Say, I am your sign: as I have done, so will it be done to them: they will go away as prisoners.";
B._Eze12_12="And the ruler who is among them will take his goods on his back in the dark and go out: he will make a hole in the wall through which to go out: he will have his face covered so that he may not be seen.";
B._Eze12_13="And my net will be stretched out on him, and he will be taken in my cords: and I will take him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldaeans; but he will not see it, and there death will come to him.";
B._Eze12_14="And all his helpers round about him and all his armies I will send in flight to every wind; and I will let loose a sword after them.";
B._Eze12_15="And they will be certain that I am the Lord, when I send them in flight among the nations, driving them out through the countries.";
B._Eze12_16="But a small number of them I will keep from the sword, from the need of food, and from disease, so that they may make clear all their disgusting ways among the nations where they come; and they will be certain that I am the Lord.";
B._Eze12_17="Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze12_18="Son of man, take your food with shaking fear, and your water with trouble and care;";
B._Eze12_19="And say to the people of the land, This is what the Lord has said about the people of Jerusalem and the land of Israel: They will take their food with care and their drink with wonder, so that all the wealth of their land may be taken from it because of the violent ways of the people living in it.";
B._Eze12_20="And the peopled towns will be made waste, and the land will become a wonder; and you will be certain that I am the Lord.";
B._Eze12_21="And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze12_22="Son of man, what is this saying which you have about the land of Israel, The time is long and every vision comes to nothing?";
B._Eze12_23="For this cause say to them, This is what the Lord has said: I have made this saying come to an end, and it will no longer be used as a common saying in Israel; but say to them, The days are near, and the effect of every vision.";
B._Eze12_24="For there will be no more false visions or smooth use of secret arts in Israel.";
B._Eze12_25="For I am the Lord; I will say the word and what I say I will do; it will not be put off: for in your days, O uncontrolled people, I will say the word and do it, says the Lord.";
B._Eze12_26="Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze12_27="Son of man, see, the children of Israel say, The vision which he sees is for the days which are a long way off, and his words are of times still far away.";
B._Eze12_28="Say to them then, This is what the Lord has said: Not one of my words will be put off any longer, but what I say I will do, says the Lord.";
B._Eze13_1="And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze13_2="Son of man, be a prophet against the prophets of Israel, and say to those prophets whose words are the invention of their hearts, Give ear to the word of the Lord;";
B._Eze13_3="This is what the Lord has said: A curse on the foolish prophets who go after the spirit which is in them and have seen nothing!";
B._Eze13_4="O Israel, your prophets have been like jackals in the waste places.";
B._Eze13_5="You have not gone up into the broken places or made up the wall for the children of Israel to take your place in the fight in the day of the Lord.";
B._Eze13_6="They have seen visions without substance and made use of secret arts, who say, The Lord has said; and the Lord has not sent them: hoping that the word would have effect.";
B._Eze13_7="Have you not seen a vision without substance and have you not falsely made use of secret arts, when you say, The Lord has said; though I have said nothing?";
B._Eze13_8="So this is what the Lord has said: Because your words are without substance and your visions are false, see, I am against you, says the Lord.";
B._Eze13_9="And my hand will be against the prophets who see visions without substance and who make false use of secret arts: they will not be in the secret of my people, and they will not be recorded in the list of the children of Israel, and they will not come into the land of Israel; and it will be clear to you that I am the Lord.";
B._Eze13_10="Because, even because they have been guiding my people into error, saying, Peace; when there is no peace; and in the building of a division wall they put whitewash on it:";
B._Eze13_11="Say to those who put whitewash on it, There will be an overflowing shower; and you, O ice-drops, will come raining down; and it will be broken in two by the storm-wind.";
B._Eze13_12="And when the wall has come down, will they not say to you, Where is the whitewash which you put on it?";
B._Eze13_13="For this reason, the Lord has said: I will have it broken in two by a storm-wind in my passion; and there will be an overflowing shower in my wrath, and you, O ice-drops, will come raining angrily down.";
B._Eze13_14="So I will let the wall, which you were covering with whitewash, be broken down; I will have it levelled to the earth so that its base is uncovered: it will come down, and destruction will come on you with it; and it will be clear to you that I am the Lord.";
B._Eze13_15="So I will let loose my passion on the wall in full measure, and on those who put whitewash on it; and I will say to you, Where is the wall, and where are those who put whitewash on it?";
B._Eze13_16="Even the prophets of Israel who say words to Jerusalem, who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace, says the Lord.";
B._Eze13_17="And you, son of man, let your face be turned against the daughters of your people, who are acting the part of prophets at their pleasure; be a prophet against them, and say,";
B._Eze13_18="This is what the Lord has said: A curse is on the women who are stitching bands on all arms and putting veils on the heads of those of every size, so that they may go after souls! Will you go after the souls of my people and keep yourselves safe from death?";
B._Eze13_19="And you have put me to shame among my people for a little barley and some bits of bread, sending death on souls for whom there is no cause of death, and keeping those souls living who have no right to life, by the false words you say to my people who give ear to what is false.";
B._Eze13_20="For this cause the Lord has said: See, I am against your bands with which you go after souls, and I will violently take them off their arms; and I will let loose the souls, even the souls whom you go after freely.";
B._Eze13_21="And I will have your veils violently parted in two, and will make my people free from your hands, and they will no longer be in your power for you to go after them; and you will be certain that I am the Lord.";
B._Eze13_22="Because with your false words you have given pain to the heart of the upright man when I had not made him sad; in order to make strong the hands of the evil-doer so that he may not be turned from his evil way and get life:";
B._Eze13_23="For this cause you will see no more foolish visions or make false use of secret arts: and I will make my people free from your power; and you will be certain that I am the Lord.";
B._Eze14_1="Then certain of the responsible men of Israel came to me and took their seats before me.";
B._Eze14_2="And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze14_3="Son of man, these men have taken their false gods into their hearts and put before their faces the sin which is the cause of their fall: am I to give ear when they come to me for directions?";
B._Eze14_4="For this cause say to them, These are the words of the Lord: Every man of Israel who has taken his false god into his heart, and put before his face the sin which is the cause of his fall, and comes to the prophet; I the Lord will give him an answer by myself in agreement with the number of his false gods;";
B._Eze14_5="So as to take the children of Israel in the thoughts of their hearts, because they have become strange to me through their false gods.";
B._Eze14_6="For this cause say to the children of Israel, These are the words of the Lord: Come back and give up your false gods and let your faces be turned from your disgusting things.";
B._Eze14_7="When any one of the men of Israel, or of those from other lands who are living in Israel, who has become strange to me, and takes his false gods into his heart, and puts before his face the sin which is the cause of his fall, comes to the prophet to get directions from me; I the Lord will give him an answer by myself:";
B._Eze14_8="And my face will be turned against that man, and I will make him a sign and a common saying, cutting him off from among my people; and you will be certain that I am the Lord.";
B._Eze14_9="And if the prophet, tricked by deceit, says anything, it is I the Lord by whom he has been tricked, and I will put out my hand against him, and he will be cut off from among my people Israel.";
B._Eze14_10="And the punishment of their sin will be on them: the sin of the prophet will be the same as the sin of him who goes to him for directions;";
B._Eze14_11="So that the children of Israel may no longer go wandering away from me, or make themselves unclean with all their wrongdoing; but they will be my people, and I will be their God, says the Lord.";
B._Eze14_12="And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze14_13="Son of man, when a land, sinning against me, does wrong, and my hand is stretched out against it, and the support of its bread is broken, and I make it short of food, cutting off man and beast from it:";
B._Eze14_14="Even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, only themselves would they keep safe by their righteousness, says the Lord.";
B._Eze14_15="Or if I send evil beasts through the land causing destruction and making it waste, so that no man may go through because of the beasts:";
B._Eze14_16="Even if these three men were in it, by my life, says the Lord, they would not keep safe their sons or daughters, but only themselves, and the land would be made waste.";
B._Eze14_17="Or if I send a sword against that land, and say, Sword, go through the land, cutting off from it man and beast:";
B._Eze14_18="Even if these three men were in it, by my life, says the Lord, they would not keep safe their sons or daughters, but only themselves.";
B._Eze14_19="Or if I send disease into that land, letting loose my wrath on it in blood, cutting off from it man and beast:";
B._Eze14_20="Even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, by my life, says the Lord, they would not keep son or daughter safe; only themselves would they keep safe through their righteousness.";
B._Eze14_21="For this is what the Lord has said: How much more when I send my four bitter punishments on Jerusalem, the sword and need of food and evil beasts and disease, cutting off from it man and beast?";
B._Eze14_22="But truly, there will still be a small band who will be safe, even sons and daughters: and they will come out to you, and you will see their ways and their doings: and you will be comforted about the evil which I have sent on Jerusalem, even about everything I have sent on it.";
B._Eze14_23="They will give you comfort when you see their ways and their doings: and you will be certain that not for nothing have I done all the things I have done in it, says the Lord.";
B._Eze15_1="And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze15_2="Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any branching tree which is among the trees of the woods?";
B._Eze15_3="Will its wood be used for any work? do men make of it a pin for hanging any vessel on?";
B._Eze15_4="See, it is put into the fire for burning: the fire has made a meal of its two ends and the middle part of it is burned; is it good for any work?";
B._Eze15_5="Truly, before it was cut down, it was not used for any purpose: how much less, when the fire has made a meal of it and it is burned, will it be made into anything?";
B._Eze15_6="For this cause the Lord has said: Like the vine-tree among the trees of the woods which I have given to the fire for burning, so will I give the people of Jerusalem.";
B._Eze15_7="And my face will be turned against them; and though they have come out of the fire they will be burned up by it; and it will be clear to you that I am the Lord when my face is turned against them.";
B._Eze15_8="And I will make the land a waste because they have done evil, says the Lord.";
B._Eze16_1="And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze16_2="Son of man, make clear to Jerusalem her disgusting ways,";
B._Eze16_3="And say, This is what the Lord has said to Jerusalem: Your start and your birth was from the land of the Canaanite; an Amorite was your father and your mother was a Hittite.";
B._Eze16_4="As for your birth, on the day of your birth your cord was not cut and you were not washed in water to make you clean; you were not salted or folded in linen bands.";
B._Eze16_5="No eye had pity on you to do any of these things to you or to be kind to you; but you were put out into the open country, because your life was hated at the time of your birth.";
