B._Exo16_5="And on the sixth day they are to make ready what they get in, and it will be twice as much as they get on the other days.";
B._Exo16_6="And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, This evening it will be clear to you that it is the Lord who has taken you out of the land of Egypt:";
B._Exo16_7="And in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord; for your angry words against the Lord have come to his ears: and what are we that you are crying out against us?";
B._Exo16_8="And Moses said, The Lord will give you meat for your food at evening, and in the morning bread in full measure; for your outcry against the Lord has come to his ears: for what are we? your outcry is not against us but against the Lord.";
B._Exo16_9="And Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the people of Israel, Come near before the Lord for he has given ear to your outcry.";
B._Exo16_10="And while Aaron was talking to the children of Israel, their eyes were turned in the direction of the waste land, and they saw the glory of the Lord shining in the cloud.";
B._Exo16_11="And the Lord said to Moses,";
B._Exo16_12="The outcry of the children of Israel has come to my ears: say to them now, At nightfall you will have meat for your food, and in the morning bread in full measure; and you will see that I am the Lord your God.";
B._Exo16_13="And it came about that in the evening little birds came up and the place was covered with them: and in the morning there was dew all round about the tents.";
B._Exo16_14="And when the dew was gone, on the face of the earth was a small round thing, like small drops of ice on the earth.";
B._Exo16_15="And when the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, What is it? for they had no idea what it was. And Moses said to them, It is the bread which the Lord has given you for your food.";
B._Exo16_16="This is what the Lord has said, Let every man take up as much as he has need of; at the rate of one omer for every person, let every man take as much as is needed for his family.";
B._Exo16_17="And the children of Israel did so, and some took more and some less.";
B._Exo16_18="And when it was measured, he who had taken up much had nothing over, and he who had little had enough; every man had taken what he was able to make use of.";
B._Exo16_19="And Moses said to them, Let nothing be kept till the morning.";
B._Exo16_20="But they gave no attention to Moses, and some of them kept it till the morning and there were worms in it and it had an evil smell: and Moses was angry with them.";
B._Exo16_21="And they took it up morning by morning, every man as he had need: and when the sun was high it was gone.";
B._Exo16_22="And on the sixth day they took up twice as much of the bread, two omers for every person: and all the rulers of the people gave Moses word of it.";
B._Exo16_23="And he said, This is what the Lord has said, Tomorrow is a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord: what has to be cooked may be cooked; and what is over, put on one side to be kept till the morning.";
B._Exo16_24="And they kept it till the morning as Moses had said: and no smell came from it, and it had no worms.";
B._Exo16_25="And Moses said, Make your meal today of what you have, for this day is a Sabbath to the Lord: today you will not get any in the fields.";
B._Exo16_26="For six days you will get it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.";
B._Exo16_27="But still on the seventh day some of the people went out to get it, and there was not any.";
B._Exo16_28="And the Lord said to Moses, How long will you go against my orders and my laws?";
B._Exo16_29="See, because the Lord has given you the Sabbath, he gives you on the sixth day bread enough for two days; let every man keep where he is; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.";
B._Exo16_30="So the people took their rest on the seventh day.";
B._Exo16_31="And this bread was named manna by Israel: it was white, like a grain seed, and its taste was like cakes made with honey.";
B._Exo16_32="And Moses said, This is the order which the Lord has given: Let one omer of it be kept for future generations, so that they may see the bread which I gave you for your food in the waste land, when I took you out from the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo16_33="And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot and put one omer of manna in it, and put it away before the Lord, to be kept for future generations.";
B._Exo16_34="So Aaron put it away in front of the holy chest to be kept, as the Lord gave orders to Moses.";
B._Exo16_35="And the children of Israel had manna for their food for forty years, till they came to a land with people in it, till they came to the edge of the land of Canaan.";
B._Exo16_36="Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.";
B._Exo17_1="And the children of Israel went on from the waste land of Sin, by stages as the Lord gave them orders, and put up their tents in Rephidim: and there was no drinking-water for the people.";
B._Exo17_2="So the people were angry with Moses, and said, Give us water for drinking. And Moses said, Why are you angry with me? and why do you put God to the test?";
B._Exo17_3="And the people were in great need of water; and they made an outcry against Moses, and said, Why have you taken us out of Egypt to send death on us and our children and our cattle through need of water?";
B._Exo17_4="And Moses, crying out to the Lord, said, What am I to do to this people? they are almost ready to put me to death by stoning.";
B._Exo17_5="And the Lord said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take some of the chiefs of Israel with you, and take in your hand the rod which was stretched out over the Nile, and go.";
B._Exo17_6="See, I will take my place before you on the rock in Horeb; and when you give the rock a blow, water will come out of it, and the people will have drink. And Moses did so before the eyes of the chiefs of Israel.";
B._Exo17_7="And he gave that place the name Massah and Meribah, because the children of Israel were angry, and because they put the Lord to the test, saying, Is the Lord with us or not?";
B._Exo17_8="Then Amalek came and made war on Israel in Rephidim.";
B._Exo17_9="And Moses said to Joshua, Get together a band of men for us and go out, make war on Amalek: tomorrow I will take my place on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.";
B._Exo17_10="So Joshua did as Moses said to him, and went to war with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.";
B._Exo17_11="Now while Moses' hand was lifted up, Israel was the stronger: but when he let his hand go down, Amalek became the stronger.";
B._Exo17_12="But Moses' hands became tired; so they put a stone under him and he took his seat on it, Aaron and Hur supporting his hands, one on one side and one on the other; so his hands were kept up without falling till the sun went down.";
B._Exo17_13="And Joshua overcame Amalek and his people with the sword.";
B._Exo17_14="And the Lord said to Moses, Make a record of this in a book, so that it may be kept in memory, and say it again in the ears of Joshua: that all memory of Amalek is to be completely uprooted from the earth.";
B._Exo17_15="Then Moses put up an altar and gave it the name of Yahweh-nissi:";
B._Exo17_16="For he said, The Lord has taken his oath that there will be war with Amalek from generation to generation.";
B._Exo18_1="Now news came to Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, of all God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, and how the Lord had taken Israel out of Egypt.";
B._Exo18_2="And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away,";
B._Exo18_3="And her two sons, one of whom was named Gershom, for he said, I have been living in a strange land:";
B._Exo18_4="And the name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, The God of my father was my help, and kept me safe from the sword of Pharaoh:";
B._Exo18_5="And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to where Moses had put up his tent in the waste land, by the mountain of God.";
B._Exo18_6="And he said to Moses, I, your father-in-law, have come to you, with your wife and your two sons.";
B._Exo18_7="And Moses went out to his father-in-law, and went down on his face before him and gave him a kiss; and they said to one another, Are you well? and they came into the tent.";
B._Exo18_8="And Moses gave his father-in-law an account of all the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians because of Israel, and of all the troubles which had come on them by the way, and how the Lord had given them salvation.";
B._Exo18_9="And Jethro was glad because the Lord had been good to Israel, freeing them from the power of the Egyptians.";
B._Exo18_10="And Jethro said, Praise be to the Lord, who has taken you out of the hand of Pharaoh and out of the hand of the Egyptians; freeing the people from the yoke of the Egyptians.";
B._Exo18_11="Now I am certain that the Lord is greater than all gods, for he has overcome them in their pride.";
B._Exo18_12="Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, made a burned offering to God: and Aaron came, with the chiefs of Israel, and had a meal with Moses' father-in-law, before God.";
B._Exo18_13="Now on the day after, Moses took his seat to give decisions for the people: and the people were waiting before Moses from morning till evening.";
B._Exo18_14="And when Moses' father-in-law saw all he was doing, he said, What is this you are doing for the people? why are you seated here by yourself, with all the people waiting before you from morning till evening?";
B._Exo18_15="And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to get directions from God:";
B._Exo18_16="And if they have any question between themselves, they come to me, and I am judge between a man and his neighbour, and I give them the orders and laws of God.";
B._Exo18_17="And Moses' father-in-law said to him, What you are doing is not good.";
B._Exo18_18="Your strength and that of the people will be completely used up: this work is more than you are able to do by yourself.";
B._Exo18_19="Give ear now to my suggestion, and may God be with you: you are to be the people's representative before God, taking their causes to him:";
B._Exo18_20="Teaching them his rules and his laws, guiding them in the way they have to go, and making clear to them the work they have to do.";
B._Exo18_21="But for the rest, take from among the people able men, such as have the fear of God, true men hating profits wrongly made; and put such men over them, to be captains of thousands, captains of hundreds and of fifties and of tens;";
B._Exo18_22="And let them be judges in the causes of the people at all times: and let them put before you all important questions, but in small things let them give decisions themselves: in this way, it will be less hard for you, and they will take the weight off you.";
B._Exo18_23="If you do this, and God gives approval, then you will be able to go on without weariness, and all this people will go to their tents in peace.";
B._Exo18_24="So Moses took note of the words of his father-in-law, and did as he had said.";
B._Exo18_25="And he made selection of able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, captains of thousands, captains of hundreds and of fifties and of tens.";
B._Exo18_26="And they were judges in the causes of the people at all times: the hard questions they put before Moses; but on every small point they gave decisions themselves.";
B._Exo18_27="And Moses let his father-in-law go away, and he went back to his land.";
B._Exo19_1="In the third month after the children of Israel went out from Egypt, on the same day, they came into the waste land of Sinai.";
B._Exo19_2="And when they had gone away from Rephidim and had come into the waste land of Sinai, they put up their tents in the waste land before the mountain: there Israel put up its tents.";
B._Exo19_3="And Moses went up to God, and the voice of the Lord came to him from the mountain, saying, Say to the family of Jacob, and give word to the children of Israel:";
B._Exo19_4="You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I took you, as on eagles' wings, guiding you to myself.";
B._Exo19_5="If now you will truly give ear to my voice and keep my agreement, you will be my special property out of all the peoples: for all the earth is mine:";
B._Exo19_6="And you will be a kingdom of priests to me, and a holy nation. These are the words which you are to say to the children of Israel.";
B._Exo19_7="And Moses came and sent for the chiefs of the people and put before them all these words which the Lord had given him orders to say.";
B._Exo19_8="And all the people, answering together, said, Whatever the Lord has said we will do. And Moses took back to the Lord the words of the people.";
B._Exo19_9="And the Lord said to Moses, See, I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that what I say to you may come to the ears of the people and they may have belief in you for ever. And Moses gave the Lord word of what the people had said.";
B._Exo19_10="And the Lord said to Moses, Go to the people and make them holy today and tomorrow, and let their clothing be washed.";
B._Exo19_11="And by the third day let them be ready: for on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai, before the eyes of all the people.";
B._Exo19_12="And let limits be marked out for the people round the mountain, and say to them, Take care not to go up the mountain or near the sides of it: whoever puts his foot on the mountain will certainly come to his death:";
B._Exo19_13="He is not to be touched by a hand, but is to be stoned or have an arrow put through him; man or beast, he is to be put to death: at the long sounding of a horn they may come up to the mountain.";
B._Exo19_14="Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and made the people holy; and their clothing was washed.";
B._Exo19_15="And he said to the people, Be ready by the third day: do not come near a woman.";
B._Exo19_16="And when morning came on the third day, there were thunders and flames and a thick cloud on the mountain, and a horn sounding very loud; and all the people in the tents were shaking with fear.";
B._Exo19_17="And Moses made the people come out of their tents and take their places before God; and they came to the foot of the mountain,";
B._Exo19_18="And all the mountain of Sinai was smoking, for the Lord had come down on it in fire: and the smoke of it went up like the smoke of a great burning; and all the mountain was shaking.";
B._Exo19_19="And when the sound of the horn became louder and louder, Moses' words were answered by the voice of God.";
B._Exo19_20="Then the Lord came down on to Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain, and the Lord sent for Moses to come up to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.";
B._Exo19_21="And the Lord said to Moses, Go down and give the people orders to keep back, for fear that a great number of them, forcing their way through to see the Lord, may come to destruction.";
B._Exo19_22="And let the priests who come near to the Lord make themselves holy, for fear that the Lord may come on them suddenly.";
B._Exo19_23="And Moses said to the Lord, The people will not be able to come up the mountain, for you gave us orders to put limits round the mountain, marking it out and making it holy.";
B._Exo19_24="And the Lord said to him, Go down, and you and Aaron may come up; but let not the priests and the people make their way through to the Lord, or he will come on them suddenly.";
B._Exo19_25="So Moses went down to the people and said this to them.";
B._Exo20_1="And God said all these words:";
B._Exo20_2="I am the Lord your God who took you out of the land of Egypt, out of the prison-house.";
B._Exo20_3="You are to have no other gods but me.";
B._Exo20_4="You are not to make an image or picture of anything in heaven or on the earth or in the waters under the earth:";
B._Exo20_5="You may not go down on your faces before them or give them worship: for I, the Lord your God, am a God who will not give his honour to another; and I will send punishment on the children for the wrongdoing of their fathers, to the third and fourth generation of my haters;";
B._Exo20_6="And I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws.";
B._Exo20_7="You are not to make use of the name of the Lord your God for an evil purpose; whoever takes the Lord's name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged a sinner by the Lord";

B._Exo20_9="On six days do all your work:";
B._Exo20_10="But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; on that day you are to do no work, you or your son or your daughter, your man-servant or your woman-servant, your cattle or the man from a strange country who is living among you:";
B._Exo20_11="For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and everything in them, and he took his rest on the seventh day: for this reason the Lord has given his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy.";

B._Exo20_17="Let not your desire be turned to your neighbour's house, or his wife or his man-servant or his woman-servant or his ox or his ass or anything which is his.";
B._Exo20_18="And all the people were watching the thunderings and the flames and the sound of the horn and the mountain smoking; and when they saw it, they kept far off, shaking with fear.";
B._Exo20_19="And they said to Moses, To your words we will give ear, but let not the voice of God come to our ears, for fear death may come on us.";
B._Exo20_20="And Moses said to the people, Have no fear: for God has come to put you to the test, so that fearing him you may be kept from sin.";
B._Exo20_21="And the people kept their places far off, but Moses went near to the dark cloud where God was.";
B._Exo20_22="And the Lord said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You yourselves have seen that my voice has come to you from heaven";
B._Exo20_23="Gods of silver and gods of gold you are not to make for yourselves.";
B._Exo20_24="Make for me an altar of earth, offering on it your burned offerings and your peace-offerings, your sheep and your oxen: in every place where I have put the memory of my name, I will come to you and give you my blessing.";
B._Exo20_25="And if you make me an altar of stone do not make it of cut stones: for the touch of an instrument will make it unclean.";
B._Exo20_26="And do not go up by steps to my altar, for fear that your bodies may be seen uncovered.";
B._Exo21_1="Now these are the laws which you are to put before them.";
B._Exo21_2="If you get a Hebrew servant for money, he is to be your servant for six years, and in the seventh year you are to let him go free without payment.";

B._Exo21_4="If his master gives him a wife, and he gets sons or daughters by her, the wife and her children will be the property of the master, and the servant is to go away by himself.";
B._Exo21_5="But if the servant says clearly, My master and my wife and children are dear to me; I have no desire to be free:";
B._Exo21_6="Then his master is to take him to the gods of the house, and at the door, or at its framework, he is to make a hole in his ear with a sharp-pointed instrument; and he will be his servant for ever.";

B._Exo21_8="If she is not pleasing to her master who has taken her for himself, let a payment be made for her so that she may go free; her master has no power to get a price for her and send her to a strange land, because he has been false to her.";

B._Exo21_10="And if he takes another woman, her food and clothing and her married rights are not to be less.";

B._Exo22_2="If a thief is taken in the act of forcing his way into a house, and his death is caused by a blow, the owner of the house is not responsible for his blood.";
