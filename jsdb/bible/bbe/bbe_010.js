B._Exo10_18="So he went out from Pharaoh and made prayer to the Lord.";
B._Exo10_19="And the Lord sent a very strong west wind, which took up the locusts, driving them into the Red Sea; not one locust was to be seen in any part of Egypt.";
B._Exo10_20="But the Lord made Pharaoh's heart hard, and he did not let the children of Israel go.";
B._Exo10_21="And the Lord said to Moses, Let your hand be stretched out to heaven, and all the land of Egypt will be dark, so that men will be feeling their way about in the dark.";
B._Exo10_22="And when Moses' hand was stretched out, dark night came over all the land of Egypt for three days;";
B._Exo10_23="They were not able to see one another, and no one got up from his place for three days: but where the children of Israel were living it was light.";
B._Exo10_24="Then Pharaoh sent for Moses, and said, Go and give worship to the Lord; only let your flocks and your herds be kept here: your little ones may go with you.";
B._Exo10_25="But Moses said, You will have to let us take burned offerings to put before the Lord our God.";
B._Exo10_26="So our cattle will have to go with us, not one may be kept back; for they are needed for the worship of the Lord our God; we have no knowledge what offering we have to give till we come to the place.";
B._Exo10_27="But the Lord made Pharaoh's heart hard, and he would not let them go.";
B._Exo10_28="And Pharaoh said to him, Go away from me, take care that you come not again before me; for the day when you see my face again will be your last.";
B._Exo10_29="And Moses said, You say truly; I will not see your face again.";
B._Exo11_1="And the Lord said to Moses, I will send one more punishment on Pharaoh and on Egypt; after that he will let you go; and when he does let you go, he will not keep one of you back, but will send you out by force.";
B._Exo11_2="So go now and give orders to the people that every man and every woman is to get from his or her neighbour ornaments of silver and of gold.";
B._Exo11_3="And the Lord gave the people grace in the eyes of the Egyptians. For the man Moses was highly honoured in the land of Egypt, by Pharaoh's servants and the people.";
B._Exo11_4="And Moses said, This is what the Lord says: About the middle of the night I will go out through Egypt:";
B._Exo11_5="And death will come to every mother's first male child in all the land of Egypt, from the child of Pharaoh on his seat of power, to the child of the servant-girl crushing the grain; and the first births of all the cattle.";
B._Exo11_6="And there will be a great cry through all the land of Egypt, such as never has been or will be again.";
B._Exo11_7="But against the children of Israel, man or beast, not so much as the tongue of a dog will be moved: so that you may see how the Lord makes a division between Israel and the Egyptians.";
B._Exo11_8="And all these your servants will come to me, going down on their faces before me and saying, Go out, and all your people with you: and after that I will go out. And he went away from Pharaoh burning with wrath.";
B._Exo11_9="And the Lord said to Moses, Pharaoh will not give ear to you, so that my wonders may be increased in the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo11_10="All these wonders Moses and Aaron did before Pharaoh: but the Lord made Pharaoh's heart hard, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land.";
B._Exo12_1="And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,";
B._Exo12_2="Let this month be to you the first of months, the first month of the year.";
B._Exo12_3="Say to all the children of Israel when they are come together, In the tenth day of this month every man is to take a lamb, by the number of their fathers' families, a lamb for every family:";
B._Exo12_4="And if the lamb is more than enough for the family, let that family and its nearest neighbour have a lamb between them, taking into account the number of persons and how much food is needed for every man.";
B._Exo12_5="Let your lamb be without a mark, a male in its first year: you may take it from among the sheep or the goats:";
B._Exo12_6="Keep it till the fourteenth day of the same month, when everyone who is of the children of Israel is to put it to death between sundown and dark.";
B._Exo12_7="Then take some of the blood and put it on the two sides of the door and over the door of the house where the meal is to be taken.";
B._Exo12_8="And let your food that night be the flesh of the lamb, cooked with fire in the oven, together with unleavened bread and bitter-tasting plants.";
B._Exo12_9="Do not take it uncooked or cooked with boiling water, but let it be cooked in the oven; its head with its legs and its inside parts.";
B._Exo12_10="Do not keep any of it till the morning; anything which is not used is to be burned with fire.";
B._Exo12_11="And take your meal dressed as if for a journey, with your shoes on your feet and your sticks in your hands: take it quickly: it is the Lord's Passover.";
B._Exo12_12="For on that night I will go through the land of Egypt, sending death on every first male child, of man and of beast, and judging all the gods of Egypt: I am the Lord.";
B._Exo12_13="And the blood will be a sign on the houses where you are: when I see the blood I will go over you, and no evil will come on you for your destruction, when my hand is on the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo12_14="And this day is to be kept in your memories: you are to keep it as a feast to the Lord through all your generations, as an order for ever.";
B._Exo12_15="For seven days let your food be unleavened bread; from the first day no leaven is to be seen in your houses: whoever takes bread with leaven in it, from the first till the seventh day, will be cut off from Israel.";
B._Exo12_16="And on the first day there is to be a holy meeting and on the seventh day a holy meeting; no sort of work may be done on those days but only to make ready what is necessary for everyone's food.";
B._Exo12_17="So keep the feast of unleavened bread; for on this very day I have taken your armies out of the land of Egypt: this day, then, is to be kept through all your generations by an order for ever.";
B._Exo12_18="In the first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day, let your food be unleavened bread till the evening of the twenty-first day of the month.";
B._Exo12_19="For seven days no leaven is to be seen in your houses: for whoever takes bread which is leavened will be cut off from the people of Israel, if he is from another country or if he is an Israelite by birth.";
B._Exo12_20="Take nothing which has leaven in it; wherever you are living let your food be unleavened cakes.";
B._Exo12_21="Then Moses sent for the chiefs of Israel, and said to them, See that lambs are marked out for yourselves and your families, and let the Passover lamb be put to death.";
B._Exo12_22="And take some hyssop and put it in the blood in the basin, touching the two sides and the top of the doorway with the blood from the basin; and let not one of you go out of his house till the morning.";
B._Exo12_23="For the Lord will go through the land, sending death on the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the two sides and the top of the door, the Lord will go over your door and will not let death come in for your destruction.";
B._Exo12_24="And you are to keep this as an order to you and to your sons for ever.";
B._Exo12_25="And when you come into the land which the Lord will make yours, as he gave his word, you are to keep this act of worship.";
B._Exo12_26="And when your children say to you, What is the reason of this act of worship?";
B._Exo12_27="Then you will say, This is the offering of the Lord's Passover; for he went over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he sent death on the Egyptians, and kept our families safe. And the people gave worship with bent heads.";
B._Exo12_28="And the children of Israel went and did so; as the Lord had given orders to Moses and Aaron, so they did.";
B._Exo12_29="And in the middle of the night the Lord sent death on every first male child in the land of Egypt, from the child of Pharaoh on his seat of power to the child of the prisoner in the prison; and the first births of all the cattle.";
B._Exo12_30="Then Pharaoh got up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians; and a great cry went up from Egypt; for there was not a house where someone was not dead.";
B._Exo12_31="And he sent for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Get up and go out from among my people, you and the children of Israel; go and give worship to the Lord as you have said.";
B._Exo12_32="And take your flocks and your herds as you have said, and be gone; and give me your blessing.";
B._Exo12_33="And the Egyptians were forcing the people on, to get them out of the land quickly; for they said, We are all dead men.";
B._Exo12_34="And the people took their bread-paste before it was leavened, putting their basins in their clothing on their backs.";
B._Exo12_35="And the children of Israel had done as Moses had said; and they got from the Egyptians ornaments of silver and of gold, and clothing:";
B._Exo12_36="And the Lord had given the people grace in the eyes of the Egyptians so that they gave them whatever was requested. So they took away all their goods from the Egyptians.";
B._Exo12_37="And the children of Israel made the journey from Rameses to Succoth; there were about six hundred thousand men on foot, as well as children.";
B._Exo12_38="And a mixed band of people went with them; and flocks and herds in great numbers.";
B._Exo12_39="And they made unleavened cakes from the paste which they had taken out of Egypt; it was not leavened, for they had been sent out of Egypt so quickly, that they had no time to make any food ready.";
B._Exo12_40="Now the children of Israel had been living in Egypt for four hundred and thirty years.";
B._Exo12_41="And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, to the very day, all the armies of the Lord went out of the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo12_42="It is a watch-night before the Lord who took them out of the land of Egypt: this same night is a watch-night to the Lord for all the children of Israel, through all their generations.";
B._Exo12_43="And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, This is the law of the Passover: no man who is not an Israelite is to take of it:";
B._Exo12_44="But every man's servant, whom he has got for money, may take of it, when he has had circumcision.";
B._Exo12_45="A man from a strange country living among you, and a servant working for payment, may not take part in it.";
B._Exo12_46="It is to be taken in one house; not a bit of the flesh is to be taken out of the house, and no bone of it may be broken.";
B._Exo12_47="All Israel is to keep the feast.";
B._Exo12_48="And if a man from another country is living with you, and has a desire to keep the Passover to the Lord, let all the males of his family undergo circumcision, and then let him come near and keep it; for he will then be as one of your people; but no one without circumcision may keep it.";
B._Exo12_49="The law is the same for him who is an Israelite by birth and for the man from a strange country who is living with you.";
B._Exo12_50="So the children of Israel did as the Lord gave orders to Moses and Aaron.";
B._Exo12_51="And on that very day the Lord took the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.";
B._Exo13_1="And the Lord said to Moses,";
B._Exo13_2="Let the first male child of every mother among the children of Israel be kept holy for me, even the first male birth among man or beast; for it is mine.";
B._Exo13_3="And Moses said to the people, Let this day, on which you came out of Egypt, out of your prison-house, be kept for ever in memory; for by the strength of his hand the Lord has taken you out from this place; let no leavened bread be used.";
B._Exo13_4="On this day, in the month Abib, you are going out.";
B._Exo13_5="And it will be that, when the Lord takes you into the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, the land which he made an oath to your fathers that he would give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you will do this act of worship in this month.";
B._Exo13_6="For seven days let your food be unleavened cakes; and on the seventh day there is to be a feast to the Lord.";
B._Exo13_7="Unleavened cakes are to be your food through all the seven days; let no leavened bread be seen among you, or any leaven, in any part of your land.";
B._Exo13_8="And you will say to your son in that day, It is because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt.";
B._Exo13_9="And this will be for a sign to you on your hand and for a mark on your brow, so that the law of the Lord may be in your mouth: for with a strong hand the Lord took you out of Egypt.";
B._Exo13_10="So let this order be kept, at the right time, from year to year.";
B._Exo13_11="And when the Lord takes you into the land of Canaan, as he made his oath to you and to your fathers, and gives it to you,";
B._Exo13_12="You are to put on one side for the Lord every mother's first male child, the first-fruit of her body, and the first young one of every beast; every male is holy to the Lord.";
B._Exo13_13="And for the young of an ass you may give a lamb in payment, or if you will not make payment for it, its neck is to be broken; but for all the first sons among your children, let payment be made.";
B._Exo13_14="And when your son says to you in time to come, What is the reason for this? say to him, By the strength of his hand the Lord took us out of Egypt, out of the prison-house:";
B._Exo13_15="And when Pharaoh made his heart hard and would not let us go, the Lord sent death on all the first sons in Egypt, of man and of beast: and so every first male who comes to birth is offered to the Lord; but for all the first of my sons I give a price.";
B._Exo13_16="And this will be for a sign on your hand and for a mark on your brow: for by the strength of his hand the Lord took us out of Egypt.";
B._Exo13_17="Now after Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not take them through the land of the Philistines, though that was near: for God said, If the people see war, they may have a change of heart and go back to Egypt.";
B._Exo13_18="But God took the people round by the waste land near the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up in fighting order out of the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo13_19="And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had made the children of Israel take an oath, saying, God will certainly keep you in mind; and you are to take my bones away with you.";
B._Exo13_20="Then they went on their journey from Succoth, and put up their tents in Etham at the edge of the waste land.";
B._Exo13_21="And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, guiding them on their way; and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light: so that they were able to go on day and night:";
B._Exo13_22="The pillar of cloud went ever before them by day, and the pillar of fire by night.";
B._Exo14_1="And the Lord said to Moses,";
B._Exo14_2="Give orders to the children of Israel to go back and put up their tents before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, in front of Baal-zephon, opposite to which you are to put up your tents by the sea.";
B._Exo14_3="And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are wandering without direction, they are shut in by the waste land.";
B._Exo14_4="And I will make Pharaoh's heart hard, and he will come after them and I will be honoured over Pharaoh and all his army, so that the Egyptians may see that I am the Lord. And they did so.";
B._Exo14_5="And word came to Pharaoh of the flight of the people: and the feeling of Pharaoh and of his servants about the people was changed, and they said, Why have we let Israel go, so that they will do no more work for us?";
B._Exo14_6="So he had his war-carriage made ready and took his people with him:";
B._Exo14_7="And he took six hundred carriages, all the carriages of Egypt, and captains over all of them.";
B._Exo14_8="And the Lord made the heart of Pharaoh hard, and he went after the children of Israel: for the children of Israel had gone out without fear.";
B._Exo14_9="But the Egyptians went after them, all the horses and carriages of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them in their tents by the sea, by Pihahiroth, before Baal-zephon.";
B._Exo14_10="And when Pharaoh came near, the children of Israel, lifting up their eyes, saw the Egyptians coming after them, and were full of fear; and their cry went up to God.";
B._Exo14_11="And they said to Moses, Was there no resting-place for the dead in Egypt, that you have taken us away to come to our death in the waste land? why have you taken us out of Egypt?";
B._Exo14_12="Did we not say to you in Egypt, Let us be as we are, working for the Egyptians? for it is better to be the servants of the Egyptians than to come to our death in the waste land.";
B._Exo14_13="But Moses said, Keep where you are and have no fear; now you will see the salvation of the Lord which he will give you today; for the Egyptians whom you see today you will never see again.";
B._Exo14_14="The Lord will make war for you, you have only to keep quiet.";
B._Exo14_15="And the Lord said to Moses, Why are you crying out to me? give the children of Israel the order to go forward.";
B._Exo14_16="And let your rod be lifted up and your hand stretched out over the sea, and it will be parted in two; and the children of Israel will go through on dry land.";
B._Exo14_17="And I will make the heart of the Egyptians hard, and they will go in after them: and I will be honoured over Pharaoh and over his army, his war-carriages, and his horsemen.";
B._Exo14_18="And the Egyptians will see that I am the Lord, when I get honour over Pharaoh and his war-carriages and his horsemen.";
B._Exo14_19="Then the angel of God, who had been before the tents of Israel, took his place at their back; and the pillar of cloud, moving from before them, came to rest at their back:";
B._Exo14_20="And it came between the army of Egypt and the army of Israel; and there was a dark cloud between them, and they went on through the night; but the one army came no nearer to the other all the night.";
B._Exo14_21="And when Moses' hand was stretched out over the sea, the Lord with a strong east wind made the sea go back all night, and the waters were parted in two and the sea became dry land.";
B._Exo14_22="And the children of Israel went through the sea on dry land: and the waters were a wall on their right side and on their left.";
B._Exo14_23="Then the Egyptians went after them into the middle of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses and his war-carriages and his horsemen.";
B._Exo14_24="And in the morning watch, the Lord, looking out on the armies of the Egyptians from the pillar of fire and cloud, sent trouble on the army of the Egyptians;";
B._Exo14_25="And made the wheels of their war-carriages stiff, so that they had hard work driving them: so the Egyptians said, Let us go in flight from before the face of Israel, for the Lord is fighting for them against the Egyptians.";
B._Exo14_26="And the Lord said to Moses, Let your hand be stretched out over the sea, and the waters will come back again on the Egyptians, and on their war-carriages and on their horsemen.";
B._Exo14_27="And when Moses' hand was stretched out over the sea, at dawn the sea came flowing back, meeting the Egyptians in their flight, and the Lord sent destruction on the Egyptians in the middle of the sea.";
B._Exo14_28="And the waters came back, covering the war-carriages and the horsemen and all the army of Pharaoh which went after them into the middle of the sea; not one of them was to be seen.";
B._Exo14_29="But the children of Israel went through the sea walking on dry land, and the waters were a wall on their right side and on their left.";
B._Exo14_30="So that day the Lord gave Israel salvation from the hands of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the sea's edge.";
B._Exo14_31="And Israel saw the great work which the Lord had done against the Egyptians, and the fear of the Lord came on the people and they had faith in the Lord and in his servant Moses.";
B._Exo15_1="Then Moses and the children of Israel made this song to the Lord, and said, I will make a song to the Lord, for he is lifted up in glory: the horse and the horseman he has sent down into the sea.";

B._Exo15_3="The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name.";
B._Exo15_4="Pharaoh's war-carriages and his army he has sent down into the sea: the best of his captains have gone down into the Red Sea.";
B._Exo15_5="They were covered by the deep waters: like a stone they went down under the waves.";
B._Exo15_6="Full of glory, O Lord, is the power of your right hand; by your right hand those who came against you are broken.";
B._Exo15_7="When you are lifted up in power, all those who come against you are crushed: when you send out your wrath, they are burned up like dry grass.";
B._Exo15_8="By your breath the waves were massed together, the flowing waters were lifted up like a pillar; the deep waters became solid in the heart of the sea.";
B._Exo15_9="Egypt said, I will go after them, I will overtake, I will make division of their goods: my desire will have its way with them; my sword will be uncovered, my hand will send destruction on them.";
B._Exo15_10="You sent your wind and the sea came over them: they went down like lead into the great waters.";
B._Exo15_11="Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods? who is like you, in holy glory, to be praised with fear, doing wonders?";
B._Exo15_12="When your right hand was stretched out, the mouth of the earth was open for them.";
B._Exo15_13="In your mercy you went before the people whom you have made yours; guiding them in your strength to your holy place.";
B._Exo15_14="Hearing of you the peoples were shaking in fear: the people of Philistia were gripped with pain.";
B._Exo15_15="The chiefs of Edom were troubled in heart; the strong men of Moab were in the grip of fear: all the people of Canaan became like water.";
B._Exo15_16="Fear and grief came on them; by the strength of your arm they were turned to stone; till your people went over, O Lord, till the people went over whom you have made yours.";
B._Exo15_17="You will take them in, planting them in the mountain of your heritage, the place, O Lord, where you have made your house, the holy place, O Lord, the building of your hands.";
B._Exo15_18="The Lord is King for ever and ever.";
B._Exo15_19="For the horses of Pharaoh, with his war-carriages and his horsemen, went into the sea, and the Lord sent the waters of the sea back over them; but the children of Israel went through the sea on dry land.";
B._Exo15_20="And Miriam, the woman prophet, the sister of Aaron, took an instrument of music in her hand; and all the women went after her with music and dances.";
B._Exo15_21="And Miriam, answering, said, Make a song to the Lord, for he is lifted up in glory; the horse and the horseman he has sent into the sea.";
B._Exo15_22="Then Moses took Israel forward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the waste land of Shur; and for three days they were in the waste land where there was no water.";
B._Exo15_23="And when they came to Marah, the water was no good for drinking, for the waters of Marah were bitter, which is why it was named Marah.";
B._Exo15_24="And the people, crying out against Moses, said, What are we to have for drink?";
B._Exo15_25="And in answer to his prayer, the Lord made him see a tree, and when he put it into the water, the water was made sweet. There he gave them a law and an order, testing them;";

B._Exo16_1="And they went on their way from Elim, and all the children of Israel came into the waste land of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they went out of the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo16_2="And all the children of Israel were crying out against Moses and Aaron in the waste land:";
B._Exo16_3="And the children of Israel said to them, It would have been better for the Lord to have put us to death in the land of Egypt, where we were seated by the flesh-pots and had bread enough for our needs; for you have taken us out to this waste of sand, to put all this people to death through need of food.";
B._Exo16_4="Then the Lord said to Moses, See, I will send down bread from heaven for you; and the people will go out every day and get enough for the day's needs; so that I may put them to the test to see if they will keep my laws or not.";
