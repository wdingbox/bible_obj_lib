B._Gen24_48="And with bent head I gave worship and praise to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, by whom I had been guided in the right way, to get the daughter of my master's brother for his son.";
B._Gen24_49="And now, say if you will do what is good and right for my master or not, in order that it may be clear to me what I have to do.";
B._Gen24_50="Then Laban and Bethuel said in answer, This is the Lord's doing: it is not for us to say Yes or No to you.";

B._Gen24_52="And at these words, Abraham's servant went down on his face and gave praise to the Lord.";
B._Gen24_53="Then he took jewels of silver and jewels of gold and fair robes and gave them to Rebekah: and he gave things of value to her mother and her brother.";

B._Gen24_56="And he said, Do not keep me; the Lord has given a good outcome to my journey; let me now go back to my master.";
B._Gen24_57="And they said, We will send for the girl, and let her make the decision.";
B._Gen24_58="And they sent for Rebekah and said to her, Are you ready to go with this man? And she said, I am ready.";
B._Gen24_59="So they sent their sister Rebekah and her servant with Abraham's servant and his men.";
B._Gen24_60="And they gave Rebekah their blessing, saying, O sister, may you be the mother of thousands and ten thousands; and may your seed overcome all those who make war against them.";
B._Gen24_61="So Rebekah and her servant-women went with the man, seated on the camels; and so the servant took Rebekah and went on his way.";
B._Gen24_62="Now Isaac had come through the waste land to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the South.";

B._Gen25_23="And the Lord said to her, Two nations are in your body, and two peoples will come to birth from you: the one will be stronger than the other, and the older will be the servant of the younger.";
B._Gen25_24="And when the time came for her to give birth, there were two children in her body.";
B._Gen25_25="And the first came out red from head to foot like a robe of hair, and they gave him the name of Esau.";
B._Gen25_26="And after him, his brother came out, gripping Esau's foot; and he was named Jacob: Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them.";
B._Gen25_27="And the boys came to full growth; and Esau became a man of the open country, an expert bowman; but Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.";
B._Gen25_28="Now Isaac's love was for Esau, because Esau's meat was greatly to his taste: but Rebekah had more love for Jacob.";
B._Gen25_29="And one day Jacob was cooking some soup when Esau came in from the fields in great need of food;";
B._Gen25_30="And Esau said to Jacob, Give me a full meal of that red soup, for I am overcome with need for food: for this reason he was named Edom.";
B._Gen25_31="And Jacob said, First of all give me your birthright.";
B._Gen25_32="And Esau said, Truly, I am at the point of death: what profit is the birthright to me?";
B._Gen25_33="And Jacob said, First of all give me your oath; and he gave him his oath, handing over his birthright to Jacob.";
B._Gen25_34="Then Jacob gave him bread and soup; and he took food and drink and went away, caring little for his birthright.";
B._Gen26_1="Then came a time of great need in the land, like that which had been before in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, at Gerar.";
B._Gen26_2="And the Lord came to him in a vision and said, Do not go down to Egypt; keep in the land of which I will give you knowledge:";

B._Gen26_4="I will make your seed like the stars of heaven in number, and will give them all these lands, and your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth;";
B._Gen26_5="Because Abraham gave ear to my voice and kept my words, my rules, my orders, and my laws.";
B._Gen26_6="So Isaac went on living in Gerar;";
B._Gen26_7="And when he was questioned by the men of the place about his wife, he said, She is my sister; fearing to say, She is my wife; for, he said, the men of the place may put me to death on account of Rebekah; because she is very beautiful.";

B._Gen26_10="Then Abimelech said, What have you done to us? one of the people might well have had connection with your wife, and the sin would have been ours.";
B._Gen26_11="And Abimelech gave orders to his people that anyone touching Isaac or his wife was to be put to death.";
B._Gen26_12="Now Isaac, planting seed in that land, got in the same year fruit a hundred times as much, for the blessing of the Lord was on him.";
B._Gen26_13="And his wealth became very great, increasing more and more;";
B._Gen26_14="For he had great wealth of flocks and herds and great numbers of servants; so that the Philistines were full of envy.";
B._Gen26_15="Now all the water-holes, which his father's servants had made in the days of Abraham, had been stopped up with earth by the Philistines.";
B._Gen26_16="And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go away from us, for you are stronger than we are.";
B._Gen26_17="So Isaac went away from there, and put up his tents in the valley of Gerar, making his living-place there.";
B._Gen26_18="And he made again the water-holes which had been made in the days of Abraham his father, and which had been stopped up by the Philistines; and he gave them the names which his father had given them.";
B._Gen26_19="Now Isaac's servants made holes in the valley, and came to a spring of flowing water.";
B._Gen26_20="But the herdmen of Gerar had a fight with Isaac's herdmen, for they said, The spring is ours: so he gave the spring the name of Esek, because there was a fight about it.";
B._Gen26_21="Then they made another water-hole, and there was a fight about that, so he gave it the name of Sitnah.";
B._Gen26_22="Then he went away from there, and made another water-hole, about which there was no fighting: so he gave it the name of Rehoboth, for he said, Now the Lord has made room for us, and we will have fruit in this land.";
B._Gen26_23="And from there he went on to Beer-sheba.";
B._Gen26_24="That night the Lord came to him in a vision, and said, I am the God of your father Abraham: have no fear for I am with you, blessing you, and your seed will be increased because of my servant Abraham.";
B._Gen26_25="Then he made an altar there, and gave worship to the name of the Lord, and he put up his tents there, and there his servants made a water-hole.";
B._Gen26_26="And Abimelech had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his friend and Phicol, the captain of his army.";
B._Gen26_27="And Isaac said to them, Why have you come to me, seeing that in your hate for me you sent me away from you?";
B._Gen26_28="And they said, We saw clearly that the Lord was with you: so we said, Let there be an oath between us and you, and let us make an agreement with you;";
B._Gen26_29="That you will do us no damage, even as we put no hand on you, and did you nothing but good, and sent you away in peace: and now the blessing of the Lord is on you.";
B._Gen26_30="Then he made a feast for them, and they all had food and drink.";
B._Gen26_31="And early in the morning they took an oath one to the other: then Isaac sent them away and they went on their way in peace.";
B._Gen26_32="And that day Isaac's servants came to him and gave him word of the water-hole which they had made, and said to him, We have come to water.";
B._Gen26_33="And he gave it the name of Shibah: so the name of that town is Beer-sheba to this day.";
B._Gen26_34="And when Esau was forty years old, he took as his wives Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite:";
B._Gen26_35="And Isaac and Rebekah had grief of mind because of them.";

B._Gen27_2="And he said, See now, I am old, and my death may take place at any time:";
B._Gen27_3="So take your arrows and your bow and go out to the field and get meat for me;";
B._Gen27_4="And make me food, good to the taste, such as is pleasing to me, and put it before me, so that I may have a meal and give you my blessing before death comes to me.";
B._Gen27_5="Now Isaac's words to his son were said in Rebekah's hearing. Then Esau went out to get the meat.";

B._Gen27_8="Now, my son, do what I say.";
B._Gen27_9="Go to the flock and get me two fat young goats; and I will make of them a meal to your father's taste:";
B._Gen27_10="And you will take it to him, so that he may have a good meal and give you his blessing before his death.";
B._Gen27_11="And Jacob said to Rebekah, his mother, But Esau my brother is covered with hair, while I am smooth:";
B._Gen27_12="If by chance my father puts his hand on me, it will seem to him that I am tricking him, and he will put a curse on me in place of a blessing.";
B._Gen27_13="And his mother said, Let the curse be on me, my son: only do as I say, and go and get them for me.";
B._Gen27_14="So he went and got them and took them to his mother: and she made a meal to his father's taste.";
B._Gen27_15="And Rebekah took the fair robes of her oldest son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son:";
B._Gen27_16="And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck:";

B._Gen27_19="And Jacob said, I am Esau, your oldest son; I have done as you said: come now, be seated and take of my meat, so that you may give me a blessing.";
B._Gen27_20="And Isaac said, How is it that you have got it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord your God made it come my way.";
B._Gen27_21="And Isaac said, Come near so that I may put my hand on you, my son, and see if you are truly my son Esau or not.";
B._Gen27_22="And Jacob went near his father Isaac: and he put his hands on him; and he said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.";
