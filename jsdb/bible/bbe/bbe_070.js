B._2Ch9_11="And with the sandal-wood the king made steps for the house of the Lord and for the king's house, and instruments of music for the makers of melody; never before had such been seen in the land of Judah.";
B._2Ch9_12="And King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she made request for, in addition to what she had taken to the king. So she went back to her country with her servants.";
B._2Ch9_13="Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents;";
B._2Ch9_14="And in addition to what he got from traders of different sorts, all the kings of Arabia and the rulers of the country gave gold and silver to Solomon.";
B._2Ch9_15="And King Solomon made two hundred body-covers of hammered gold, every one having six hundred shekels of gold in it.";
B._2Ch9_16="And he made three hundred smaller body-covers of hammered gold, using three hundred shekels of gold for every cover, and the king put them in the house of the Woods of Lebanon.";
B._2Ch9_17="Then the king made a great ivory seat, plated with the best gold.";
B._2Ch9_18="There were six steps up to it, and a foot-rest of gold fixed to it, and arms on the two sides of the seat, with two lions at the side of the arms.";
B._2Ch9_19="And twelve lions were placed on one side and on the other side on the six steps: there was nothing like it in any kingdom.";
B._2Ch9_20="All King Solomon's drinking-vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the Woods of Lebanon were of the best gold: no one gave a thought to silver in the days of Solomon.";
B._2Ch9_21="For the king had Tarshish-ships sailing with the servants of Huram: once every three years the Tarshish-ships came back with gold and silver, ivory and monkeys and peacocks.";
B._2Ch9_22="And King Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom.";
B._2Ch9_23="And all the kings of the earth came to see Solomon and to give ear to his wisdom, which God had put into his heart.";
B._2Ch9_24="And everyone took with him an offering, vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and robes, and coats of metal, and spices, and horses and beasts for transport, regularly year by year.";
B._2Ch9_25="Solomon had four thousand buildings for his horses and his war-carriages, and twelve thousand horsemen whom he kept, some in the carriage-towns and some with the king in Jerusalem.";
B._2Ch9_26="And he was ruler over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the limit of Egypt.";
B._2Ch9_27="The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem and cedars like the sycamore-trees of the lowlands in number.";
B._2Ch9_28="They got horses for Solomon from Egypt and from every land.";
B._2Ch9_29="Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not recorded in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the words of Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh, and in the visions of Iddo the seer about Jeroboam, the son of Nebat?";
B._2Ch9_30="Solomon was king over Israel in Jerusalem for forty years.";
B._2Ch9_31="And Solomon went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in the town of David his father; and Rehoboam his son became king in his place.";
B._2Ch10_1="And Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all Israel had come together to make him king.";
B._2Ch10_2="And when Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, had news of it, (for he was in Egypt where he had gone in flight from King Solomon,) he came back from Egypt.";
B._2Ch10_3="And they sent for him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came to Rehoboam and said,";
B._2Ch10_4="Your father put a hard yoke on us: if you will make the conditions under which your father kept us down less cruel, and the weight of the yoke he put on us less hard, then we will be your servants.";
B._2Ch10_5="And he said to them, Come to me again after three days. So the people went away.";
B._2Ch10_6="Then King Rehoboam took the opinion of the old men who had been with Solomon his father when he was living, and said, In your opinion, what answer am I to give to this people?";
B._2Ch10_7="And they said to him, If you are kind to this people, pleasing them and saying good words to them, then they will be your servants for ever.";
B._2Ch10_8="But he gave no attention to the opinion of the old men, but went to the young men of his generation who were waiting before him.";
B._2Ch10_9="And he said to them, What is your opinion? What answer are we to give to this people who have said to me, Make less the weight of the yoke which your father put on us?";
B._2Ch10_10="And the young men of his generation said to him, This is the answer to give to the people who came to you saying, Your father put a hard yoke on us, but will you make it less; say to them, My little finger is thicker than my father's body;";
B._2Ch10_11="If my father put a hard yoke on you, I will make it harder: my father gave you punishment with whips, but I will give you blows with snakes.";
B._2Ch10_12="So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had given orders, saying, Come to me again on the third day.";
B._2Ch10_13="And the king gave them a rough answer. So King Rehoboam gave no attention to the suggestion of the old men,";
B._2Ch10_14="But gave them the answer put forward by the young men, saying, My father made your yoke hard, but I will make it harder; my father gave you punishment with whips, but I will give it with snakes.";
B._2Ch10_15="So the king did not give ear to the people; for this came about by the purpose of God, so that the Lord might give effect to his word which he had said by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.";
B._2Ch10_16="And when all Israel saw that the king would give no attention to them, the people in answer said to the king, What part have we in David? what is our heritage in the son of Jesse? every man to your tents, O Israel; now see to your house, David. So all Israel went to their tents.";
B._2Ch10_17="But Rehoboam was still king over those of the children of Israel who were living in the towns of Judah.";
B._2Ch10_18="Then Rehoboam sent Adoniram, the overseer of the forced work; and he was stoned to death by all Israel. And King Rehoboam went quickly and got into his carriage to go in flight to Jerusalem.";
B._2Ch10_19="So Israel was turned away from the family of David to this day.";
B._2Ch11_1="And Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, and got together the men of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand of his best fighting-men, to make war against Israel and get the kingdom back for Rehoboam.";
B._2Ch11_2="But the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, the man of God, saying,";
B._2Ch11_3="Say to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,";
B._2Ch11_4="The Lord has said, You are not to go to war against your brothers: let every man go back to his house, for this thing is my purpose. So they gave ear to the words of the Lord and were turned back from fighting against Jeroboam.";
B._2Ch11_5="Now Rehoboam kept in Jerusalem, building walled towns in Judah.";
B._2Ch11_6="He was the builder of Beth-lehem and Etam and Tekoa";
B._2Ch11_7="And Beth-zur and Soco and Adullam";
B._2Ch11_8="And Gath and Mareshah and Ziph";
B._2Ch11_9="And Adoraim and Lachish and Azekah";
B._2Ch11_10="And Zorah and Aijalon and Hebron, walled towns in Judah and Benjamin.";
B._2Ch11_11="And he made the walled towns strong, and he put captains in them and stores of food, oil, and wine.";
B._2Ch11_12="And in every town he put stores of body-covers and spears, and made them very strong. And Judah and Benjamin were his.";
B._2Ch11_13="And the priests and Levites who were in all Israel came together to him from every part of their country.";
B._2Ch11_14="For the Levites gave up their living-places and their property, and came to Judah and Jerusalem; for Jeroboam and his sons had sent them away, not letting them be priests to the Lord;";
B._2Ch11_15="And he himself made priests for the high places, and for the images of he-goats and oxen which he had made.";
B._2Ch11_16="And after them, from all the tribes of Israel, all those whose hearts were fixed and true to the Lord, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to make offerings to the Lord, the God of their fathers.";
B._2Ch11_17="So they went on increasing the power of the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, strong for three years; and for three years they went in the ways of David and Solomon.";
B._2Ch11_18="And Rehoboam took as his wife Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth, the son of David and of Abihail, the daughter of Eliab, the son of Jesse;";
B._2Ch11_19="And she had sons by him, Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.";
B._2Ch11_20="And after her he took Maacah, the daughter of Absalom; and she had Abijah and Attai and Ziza and Shelomith by him.";
B._2Ch11_21="Maacah, the daughter of Absalom, was dearer to Rehoboam than all his wives and his servant-wives: (for he had eighteen wives and sixty servant-wives, and was the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.)";
B._2Ch11_22="Rehoboam made Abijah, the son of Maacah, chief and ruler among his brothers, for it was his purpose to make him king.";
B._2Ch11_23="And in his wisdom he had his sons stationed in every walled town through all the lands of Judah and Benjamin; and he gave them a great store of food, and took wives for them.";
B._2Ch12_1="Now when Rehoboam's position as king had been made certain, and he was strong, he gave up the law of the Lord, and all Israel with him.";
B._2Ch12_2="Now in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem, because of their sin against the Lord,";
B._2Ch12_3="With twelve hundred war-carriages and sixty thousand horsemen: and the people who came with him out of Egypt were more than might be numbered: Lubim and Sukkiim and Ethiopians.";
B._2Ch12_4="And he took the walled towns of Judah, and came as far as Jerusalem.";
B._2Ch12_5="Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the chiefs of Judah, who had come together in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, The Lord has said, Because you have given me up, I have given you up into the hands of Shishak.";
B._2Ch12_6="Then the chiefs of Israel and the king made themselves low and said, The Lord is upright.";
B._2Ch12_7="And the Lord, seeing that they had made themselves low, said to Shemaiah, They have made themselves low: I will not send destruction on them, but in a short time I will give them salvation, and will not let loose my wrath on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.";
B._2Ch12_8="But still they will become his servants, so that they may see how different my yoke is from the yoke of the kingdoms of the lands.";
B._2Ch12_9="So Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem and took away all the stored wealth of the house of the Lord and the king's house: he took everything away, and with the rest the gold body-covers which Solomon had made.";
B._2Ch12_10="And in their place King Rehoboam had other body-covers made of brass and gave them into the care of the captains of the armed men who were stationed at the door of the king's house.";
B._2Ch12_11="And whenever the king went into the house of the Lord, the armed men went with him taking the body-covers, and then took them back to their room.";
B._2Ch12_12="And when he made himself low, the wrath of the Lord was turned back from him, and complete destruction did not come on him, for there was still some good in Judah.";
B._2Ch12_13="So King Rehoboam made himself strong in Jerusalem and was ruling there. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he was ruling for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the town which the Lord had made his out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there; and his mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonite woman.";
B._2Ch12_14="And he did evil because his heart was not true to the Lord.";
B._2Ch12_15="Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not recorded in the words of Shemaiah the prophet and Iddo the seer? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.";
B._2Ch12_16="And Rehoboam went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in the town of David; and Abijah his son became king in his place.";
B._2Ch13_1="In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah.";
B._2Ch13_2="He was king in Jerusalem for three years; his mother's name was Maacah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.";
B._2Ch13_3="And Abijah went out to the fight with an army of men of war, four hundred thousand of his best men; and Jeroboam put his forces in line against him, eight hundred thousand of his best men of war.";
B._2Ch13_4="And Abijah took up his position on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Give ear to me, O Jeroboam and all Israel:";
B._2Ch13_5="Is it not clear to you that the Lord, the God of Israel, gave the rule over Israel to David and to his sons for ever, by an agreement made with salt?";
B._2Ch13_6="But Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon, the son of David, took up arms against his lord.";
B._2Ch13_7="And certain foolish and good-for-nothing men were joined with him, and made themselves strong against Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, when he was young and untested and not able to keep them back.";
B._2Ch13_8="And now it is your purpose to put yourselves against the authority which the Lord has put into the hands of the sons of David, and you are a very great number, and you have with you the gold oxen which Jeroboam made to be your gods.";
B._2Ch13_9="And after driving out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron and the Levites, have you not made priests for yourselves as the people of other lands do? so that anyone who comes to make himself priest by offering an ox or seven sheep, may be a priest of those who are no gods.";
B._2Ch13_10="But as for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not been turned away from him; we have priests who do the work of the Lord, even the sons of Aaron and the Levites in their places;";
B._2Ch13_11="By whom burned offerings and perfumes are sent up in smoke before the Lord every morning and every evening; and they put out the holy bread on its table and the gold support for the lights with its lights burning every evening; for we keep the orders given to us by the Lord our God, but you have gone away from him.";
B._2Ch13_12="And now God is with us at our head, and his priests with their loud horns sounding against you. O children of Israel, do not make war on the Lord, the God of your fathers, for it will not go well for you.";
B._2Ch13_13="But Jeroboam had put some of his men to make a surprise attack on them from the back, so some were facing Judah and others were stationed secretly at their back.";
B._2Ch13_14="And Judah, turning their faces, saw that they were being attacked in front and at the back; and they gave a cry for help to the Lord, while the priests were sounding their horns.";
B._2Ch13_15="And the men of Judah gave a loud cry; and at their cry, God put fear into Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.";
B._2Ch13_16="And the children of Israel went in flight before Judah, and God gave them up into their hands.";
B._2Ch13_17="And Abijah and his people put them to death with great destruction: five hundred thousand of the best of Israel were put to the sword.";
B._2Ch13_18="So at that time the children of Israel were overcome, and the children of Judah got the better of them, because they put their faith in the Lord, the God of their fathers.";
B._2Ch13_19="And Abijah went after Jeroboam and took some of his towns, Beth-el with its small towns and Jeshanah with its small towns and Ephron with its small towns.";
B._2Ch13_20="And Jeroboam did not get back his power again in the life-time of Abijah; and the Lord sent death on him.";
B._2Ch13_21="But Abijah became great, and had fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.";
B._2Ch13_22="And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways and his sayings, are recorded in the account of the prophet Iddo.";
B._2Ch14_1="So Abijah went to rest with his fathers, and they put him into the earth in the town of David, and Asa his son became king in his place; in his time the land was quiet for ten years.";
B._2Ch14_2="And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God;";
B._2Ch14_3="For he took away the altars of strange gods and the high places, and had the upright stones broken and the wood pillars cut down;";
B._2Ch14_4="And he made Judah go after the Lord, the God of their fathers, and keep his laws and his orders.";
B._2Ch14_5="And he took away the high places and the sun-images from all the towns of Judah; and the kingdom was quiet under his rule.";
B._2Ch14_6="He made walled towns in Judah, for the land was quiet and there were no wars in those years, because the Lord had given him rest.";
B._2Ch14_7="He said to Judah, Let us make these towns, building walls round them with towers and doors and locks. The land is still ours, because we have been true to the Lord our God; we have been true to him and he has given us rest on every side. So they went on building and all went well for them.";
B._2Ch14_8="And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand men of Judah armed with body-covers and spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand of Benjamin armed with body-covers and bows; all these were men of war.";
B._2Ch14_9="And Zerah the Ethiopian, with an army of a million, and three hundred war-carriages, came out against them to Mareshah.";
B._2Ch14_10="And Asa went out against him, and they put their forces in position in the valley north of Mareshah.";
B._2Ch14_11="And Asa made prayer to the Lord his God and said, Lord, you only are able to give help against the strong to him who has no strength; come to our help, O Lord our God, for our hope is in you, and in your name we have come out against this great army. O Lord, you are our God; let not man's power be greater than yours.";
B._2Ch14_12="So the Lord sent fear on the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah; and the Ethiopians went in flight.";
B._2Ch14_13="And Asa and the people who were with him went after them as far as Gerar; and so great was the destruction among the Ethiopians that they were not able to get their army together again, for they were broken before the Lord and before his army; and they took away a great amount of their goods.";
B._2Ch14_14="And they overcame all the towns round Gerar, because the Lord sent fear on them; and they took away their goods from the towns, for there were stores of wealth in them.";
B._2Ch14_15="And they made an attack on the tents of the owners of the cattle, and took away great numbers of sheep and camels and went back to Jerusalem.";
B._2Ch15_1="And the spirit of God came on Azariah, the son of Oded;";
B._2Ch15_2="And he came face to face with Asa and said to him, Give ear to me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin: the Lord is with you while you are with him; if your heart's desire is for him, he will be near you, but if you give him up, he will give you up.";
B._2Ch15_3="Now for a long time Israel has been without the true God, and without a teaching priest and without the law;";
B._2Ch15_4="But when in their trouble they were turned to the Lord, the God of Israel, searching after him, he let their search be rewarded.";
B._2Ch15_5="In those times there was no peace for him who went out or for him who came in, but great trouble was on all the people of the lands.";
B._2Ch15_6="And they were broken by divisions, nation against nation and town against town, because God sent all sorts of trouble on them.";
B._2Ch15_7="But be you strong and let not your hands be feeble, for your work will be rewarded.";
B._2Ch15_8="And Asa, hearing these words of Azariah, the son of Oded the prophet, took heart and put away all the disgusting things out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the towns which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he made new again the altar of the Lord in front of the covered way of the Lord's house.";
B._2Ch15_9="And he got together all Judah and Benjamin and those of Ephraim and Manasseh and Simeon who were living with them; for numbers of them came to him out of Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him.";
B._2Ch15_10="So they came together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the rule of Asa.";
B._2Ch15_11="And that day they made offerings to the Lord of the things they had taken in war, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.";
B._2Ch15_12="And they made an agreement to be true to the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and all their soul;";
B._2Ch15_13="And that anyone, small or great, man or woman, who was not true to the Lord, the God of Israel, would be put to death.";
B._2Ch15_14="And they made an oath to the Lord, with a loud voice, sounding wind-instruments and horns.";
B._2Ch15_15="And all Judah was glad because of the oath, for they had taken it with all their heart, turning to the Lord with all their desire; and he was with them and gave them rest on every side.";
B._2Ch15_16="And Asa would not let Maacah, his mother, be queen, because she had made a disgusting image for Asherah; and Asa had her image cut down and broken up and burned by the stream Kidron.";
B._2Ch15_17="But the high places were not taken away out of Israel; but still the heart of Asa was true to the Lord all his life.";
B._2Ch15_18="He took into the house of God all the things which his father had made holy and those which he himself had made holy, silver and gold and vessels.";
B._2Ch15_19="And there was no more war till the thirty-fifth year of the rule of Asa.";
B._2Ch16_1="In the thirty-sixth year of the rule of Asa, Baasha, king of Israel, went up against Judah, building Ramah so that no one was able to go out or in to Asa, king of Judah.";
B._2Ch16_2="Then Asa took silver and gold out of the stores of the Lord's house and of the king's store-house, and sent to Ben-hadad, king of Aram, at Damascus, saying,";
B._2Ch16_3="Let there be an agreement between me and you as there was between my father and your father: see, I have sent you silver and gold; go and put an end to your agreement with Baasha, king of Israel, so that he may give up attacking me.";
B._2Ch16_4="And Ben-hadad did as King Asa said, and sent the captains of his armies against the towns of Israel, attacking Ijon and Dan and Abel-maim, and all the store-towns of Naphtali.";
B._2Ch16_5="Then Baasha, hearing of it, put a stop to the building of Ramah, and let his work come to an end.";
B._2Ch16_6="Then King Asa, with all Judah, took away the stones and wood with which Baasha was building Ramah, and he made use of them for building Geba and Mizpah.";
B._2Ch16_7="At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa, king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have put your faith in the king of Aram and not in the Lord your God, the army of the king of Aram has got away out of your hands.";
B._2Ch16_8="Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a very great army, with war-carriages and horsemen more than might be numbered? but because your faith was in the Lord, he gave them up into your hands.";
B._2Ch16_9="For the eyes of the Lord go this way and that, through all the earth, letting it be seen that he is the strong support of those whose hearts are true to him. In this you have done foolishly, for from now you will have wars.";
B._2Ch16_10="Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in prison, burning with wrath against him because of this thing. And at the same time Asa was cruel to some of the people.";
B._2Ch16_11="Now the acts of Asa, first and last, are recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.";
B._2Ch16_12="In the thirty-ninth year of his rule, Asa had a very bad disease of the feet; but he did not go to the Lord for help in his disease, but to medical men.";
B._2Ch16_13="So Asa went to rest with his fathers, and death came to him in the forty-first year of his rule.";
B._2Ch16_14="And they put him into the resting-place which he had made for himself in the town of David, in a bed full of sweet perfumes of all sorts of spices, made by the perfumer's art, and they made a great burning for him.";
B._2Ch17_1="And Jehoshaphat his son became king in his place, and made himself strong against Israel.";
B._2Ch17_2="He put forces in all the walled towns of Judah, and responsible chiefs in the land of Judah and in the towns of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.";
B._2Ch17_3="And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he went in the early ways of his father, not turning to the Baals,";
B._2Ch17_4="But turning to the God of his father and keeping his laws, and not doing as Israel did.";
B._2Ch17_5="So the Lord made his kingdom strong; and all Judah gave offerings to Jehoshaphat, and he had great wealth and honour.";
B._2Ch17_6="His heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord; and he went so far as to take away the high places and the wood pillars out of Judah.";
B._2Ch17_7="In the third year of his rule he sent Benhail and Obadiah and Zechariah and Nethanel and Micaiah, his captains, as teachers into the towns of Judah;";
