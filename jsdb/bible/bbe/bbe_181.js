B._Rev6_12="And I saw when the sixth stamp was undone, and there was a great earth-shock; and the sun became black as haircloth, and all the moon became as blood;";
B._Rev6_13="And the stars of heaven were falling to the earth, like green fruit from a tree before the force of a great wind.";
B._Rev6_14="And the heaven was taken away like the roll of a book when it is rolled up; and all the mountains and islands were moved out of their places.";
B._Rev6_15="And the kings of the earth, and the rulers, and the chief captains, and the men of wealth, and the strong, and every servant and free man, took cover in the holes and the rocks of the mountains;";
B._Rev6_16="And they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Come down on us, covering us from the face of him who is seated on the high seat, and from the wrath of the Lamb:";
B._Rev6_17="For the great day of their wrath is come, and who may keep his place?";
B._Rev7_1="After this I saw four angels in their places at the four points of the earth, keeping back the four winds in their hands, so that there might be no moving of the wind on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.";
B._Rev7_2="And I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the mark of the living God: and he said with a great voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to do damage to the earth and the sea,";
B._Rev7_3="Do no damage to the earth, or the sea, or the trees, till we have put a mark on the servants of our God.";
B._Rev7_4="And there came to my ears the number of those who had the mark on their brows, a hundred and forty-four thousand, who were marked out of every tribe of the people of Israel.";
B._Rev7_5="Of the tribe of Judah were marked twelve thousand: of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand: of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand:";
B._Rev7_6="Of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand: of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand: of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand:";
B._Rev7_7="Of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand: of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand: of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand:";
B._Rev7_8="Of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand: of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand: of the tribe of Benjamin were marked twelve thousand.";
B._Rev7_9="After these things I saw a great army of people more than might be numbered, out of every nation and of all tribes and peoples and languages, taking their places before the high seat and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes, and with branches in their hands,";
B._Rev7_10="Saying with a loud voice, Salvation to our God who is seated on the high seat, and to the Lamb.";
B._Rev7_11="And all the angels were round about the high seat, and about the rulers and the four beasts; and they went down on their faces before the high seat, and gave worship to God, saying,";
B._Rev7_12="So be it. Let blessing and glory and wisdom and praise and honour and power and strength be given to our God for ever and ever. So be it.";
B._Rev7_13="And one of the rulers made answer, saying to me, These who have on white robes, who are they, and where did they come from?";
B._Rev7_14="And I said to him, My lord, you have knowledge. And he said to me, These are they who came through the great testing, and their robes have been washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb.";
B._Rev7_15="This is why they are before the high seat of God; and they are his servants day and night in his house: and he who is seated on the high seat will be a tent over them.";
B._Rev7_16="They will never be in need of food or drink: and they will never again be troubled by the burning heat of the sun:";
B._Rev7_17="For the Lamb who is on the high seat will be their keeper and their guide to fountains of living water: and God will make glad their eyes for ever.";
B._Rev8_1="And when the seventh stamp was undone there was quiet in heaven for about half an hour.";
B._Rev8_2="And I saw the seven angels who had their place before God; and seven horns were given to them.";
B._Rev8_3="And another angel came and took his place at the altar, having a gold vessel for burning perfume; and there was given to him much perfume, so that he might put it with the prayers of all the saints on the gold altar which was before the high seat.";
B._Rev8_4="And the smoke of the perfume, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand.";
B._Rev8_5="And the angel took the vessel; and he made it full of the fire of the altar, and sent it down on the earth: and there came thunders and voices and flames and a shaking of the earth.";
B._Rev8_6="And the seven angels who had the seven horns made ready for sounding them.";
B._Rev8_7="And at the sounding of the first, a rain of ice and fire, mixed with blood, was sent on the earth: and a third part of the earth, and of the trees, and all green grass was burned up.";
B._Rev8_8="And at the sounding of the second angel, it was as if a great mountain burning with fire was sent into the sea: and a third part of the sea became blood,";
B._Rev8_9="And destruction came on a third part of the living things which were in the sea, and on a third part of the ships.";
B._Rev8_10="And at the sounding of the third angel, there went down from heaven a great star, burning like a flame, and it came on a third part of the rivers, and on the fountains of water.";
B._Rev8_11="And the name of the star is Wormwood: and a third part of the waters became bitter; and a number of men came to their end because of the waters, for they were made bitter.";
B._Rev8_12="And at the sounding of the fourth angel, a third part of the sun, and of the moon, and of the stars was made dark, so that there was no light for a third part of the day and of the night.";
B._Rev8_13="And there came to my ears the cry of an eagle in flight in the middle of heaven, saying with a great voice, Trouble, trouble, trouble, to all on the earth, because of the other voices of the horns of the three angels, whose sounding is still to come.";
B._Rev9_1="And at the sounding of the fifth angel I saw a star falling from heaven to the earth: and there was given to him the key of the great deep.";
B._Rev9_2="And he made the great deep open and a smoke went up from it, like the smoke of a great oven; and the sun and the air were made dark because of the smoke.";
B._Rev9_3="And from the smoke locusts came out on the earth; and power was given them, like the power of scorpions.";
B._Rev9_4="And they were ordered to do no damage to the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only to such men as have not the mark of God on their brows.";
B._Rev9_5="And orders were given them not to put them to death, but to give them great pain for five months: and their pain was as the pain from the wound of a scorpion.";
B._Rev9_6="And in those days men will be hoping for death, and it will not come to them; and they will have a great desire for death, and death will go in flight from them.";
B._Rev9_7="And the forms of the locusts were like horses made ready for war; and on their heads they had crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.";
B._Rev9_8="And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.";
B._Rev9_9="And they had breastplates like iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of carriages, like an army of horses rushing to the fight.";
B._Rev9_10="And they have pointed tails like scorpions; and in their tails is their power to give men wounds for five months.";
B._Rev9_11="They have over them as king the angel of the great deep: his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek language Apollyon.";
B._Rev9_12="The first Trouble is past: see, there are still two Troubles to come.";
B._Rev9_13="And at the sounding of the sixth angel a voice came to my ears from the horns of the gold altar which is before God,";
B._Rev9_14="Saying to the sixth angel who had the horn, Make free the four angels who are chained at the great river Euphrates.";
B._Rev9_15="And the four angels were made free, who were ready for the hour and day and month and year, that they might put to death a third part of men.";
B._Rev9_16="And the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand: the number of them came to my ears.";
B._Rev9_17="And so I saw the horses in the vision, and those who were seated on them, having breastplates of fire and glass and of burning stone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and a smell of burning.";
B._Rev9_18="By these evils a third part of men was put to death, by the fire, and the smoke, and the burning smell which came out of their mouths.";
B._Rev9_19="For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails: because their tails are like snakes, and have heads, and with them they give wounds.";
B._Rev9_20="And the rest of the people, who were not put to death by these evils, were not turned from the works of their hands, but went on giving worship to evil spirits, and images of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood which have no power of seeing or hearing or walking:";
B._Rev9_21="And they had no regret for putting men to death, or for their use of secret arts, or for the evil desires of the flesh, or for taking the property of others.";
B._Rev10_1="And I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and an arch of coloured light was round his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire;";
B._Rev10_2="And he had in his hand a little open book: and he put his right foot on the sea, and his left on the earth;";
B._Rev10_3="And he gave a loud cry, like the angry voice of a lion: and at his cry the voices of the seven thunders were sounding.";
B._Rev10_4="And when the seven thunders had given out their voices, I was about to put their words down: and a voice from heaven came to my ears, saying, Keep secret the things which the seven thunders said, and do not put them in writing.";
B._Rev10_5="And the angel which I saw taking his position on the sea and on the earth, put up his right hand to heaven,";
B._Rev10_6="And took his oath by him who is living for ever and ever, who made the heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there would be no more waiting:";
B._Rev10_7="But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when the sound of his horn is about to come, then will the secret of God be complete, of which he gave the good news to his servants the prophets.";
B._Rev10_8="And the voice came to me again from heaven, saying, Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who has his place on the sea and on the earth.";
B._Rev10_9="And I went to the angel, and said to him, Give me the little book. And he said to me: Put it in your mouth; and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.";
B._Rev10_10="And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and did as he said; and it was sweet as honey in my mouth: and when I had taken it, my stomach was made bitter.";
B._Rev10_11="And they said to me, You are to give word again of what is coming in the future to the peoples and nations and languages and kings.";
B._Rev11_1="And there was given to me a measuring rod: and one said, Go up and take the measure of the house of God, and the altar, and the worshippers in it.";
B._Rev11_2="But do not take the measure of the space outside the house; because it has been given to the nations: and the holy town will be under their feet for forty-two months.";
B._Rev11_3="And I will give orders to my two witnesses, and they will be prophets for a thousand, two hundred and sixty days, clothed with haircloth.";
B._Rev11_4="These are the two olive-trees and the two lights, which are before the Lord of the earth.";
B._Rev11_5="And if any man would do them damage, fire comes out of their mouth and puts an end to those who are working against them: and if any man has a desire to do them damage, in this way will he be put to death.";
B._Rev11_6="These have the power to keep the heaven shut, so that there may be no rain in the days when they are prophets: and they have power over the waters to make them into blood, and to send every sort of disease on the earth as their pleasure is.";
B._Rev11_7="And when they have come to the end of their witness, the beast which comes up out of the great deep will make war on them and overcome them and put them to death.";
B._Rev11_8="And their dead bodies will be in the open street of the great town, which in the spirit is named Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was put to death on the cross.";
B._Rev11_9="And the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will be looking on their dead bodies three days and a half, and will not let their dead bodies be put in the earth.";
B._Rev11_10="And those who are on the earth will have pleasure and delight over them; and they will send offerings one to another because these two prophets gave great trouble to all on the earth.";
B._Rev11_11="And after three days and a half the breath of life from God went into them, and they got up on their feet; and great fear came on those who saw them.";
B._Rev11_12="And a great voice from heaven came to their ears, saying to them, Come up here. And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and were seen by those desiring their death.";
B._Rev11_13="And in that hour there was a great earth-shock and a tenth part of the town came to destruction; and in the earth-shock seven thousand persons came to their end: and the rest were in fear, and gave glory to the God of heaven.";
B._Rev11_14="The second Trouble is past: see, the third Trouble comes quickly.";
B._Rev11_15="And at the sounding of the seventh angel there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he will have rule for ever and ever.";
B._Rev11_16="And the four and twenty rulers, who are seated before God on their high seats, went down on their faces and gave worship to God, saying,";
B._Rev11_17="We give you praise, O Lord God, Ruler of all, who is and who was; because you have taken up your great power and are ruling your kingdom.";
B._Rev11_18="And the nations were angry, and your wrath has come, and the time for the dead to be judged, and the time of reward for your servants, the prophets, and for the saints, and for those in whom is the fear of your name, small and great, and the time of destruction for those who made the earth unclean.";
B._Rev11_19="And the house of God which is in heaven was open; and the ark of his agreement was seen in his house, and there were flames and voices and thunders and an earth-shock and a rain of ice.";
B._Rev12_1="And a great sign was seen in heaven: a A woman clothed with the sun, and with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.";
B._Rev12_2="And she was with child; and she gave a cry, in the pains of childbirth.";
B._Rev12_3="And there was seen another sign in heaven; a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns.";
B._Rev12_4="And his tail was pulling a third part of the stars of heaven down to the earth, and the dragon took his place before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when the birth had taken place he might put an end to her child.";
B._Rev12_5="And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who was to have rule over all the nations with a rod of iron: and her child was taken up to God and to his high seat.";
B._Rev12_6="And the woman went in flight to the waste land, where she has a place made ready by God, so that there they may give her food a thousand, two hundred and sixty days.";
B._Rev12_7="And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels going out to the fight with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels made war,";
B._Rev12_8="And they were overcome, and there was no more place for them in heaven.";
B._Rev12_9="And the great dragon was forced down, the old snake, who is named the Evil One and Satan, by whom all the earth is turned from the right way; he was forced down to the earth, and his angels were forced down with him.";
B._Rev12_10="And a great voice in heaven came to my ears, saying, Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: because he who says evil against our brothers before our God day and night is forced down.";
B._Rev12_11="And they overcame him through the blood of the Lamb and the word of their witness; and loving not their lives they freely gave themselves up to death.";
B._Rev12_12="Be glad then, O heavens, and you who are in them. But there is trouble for the earth and the sea: because the Evil One has come down to you, being very angry, having the knowledge that he has but a short time.";
B._Rev12_13="And when the dragon saw that he was forced down to the earth, he made cruel attacks on the woman who gave birth to the male child.";
B._Rev12_14="And there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle, so that she might go in flight into the waste land, to her place, where she is given food for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the snake.";
B._Rev12_15="And the snake sent out of his mouth after the woman a river of water, so that she might be taken away by the stream.";
B._Rev12_16="And the earth gave help to the woman, and with open mouth took up the river which the dragon sent out of his mouth.";
B._Rev12_17="And the dragon was angry with the woman and went away to make war on the rest of her seed, who keep the orders of God, and the witness of Jesus:";
B._Rev13_1="And he took his place on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads unholy names.";
B._Rev13_2="And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority.";
B._Rev13_3="And I saw one of his heads as if it had been given a death-wound; and his death-wound was made well: and all the earth was wondering at the beast.";
B._Rev13_4="And they gave worship to the dragon, because he gave authority to the beast; and worshipping the beast, they said, Who is like the beast? and who is able to go to war with him?";
B._Rev13_5="And there was given to him a mouth to say words of pride against God; and there was given to him authority to go on for forty-two months.";
B._Rev13_6="And his mouth was open to say evil against God, and against his name and his Tent, even against those who are in heaven.";
B._Rev13_7="And it was given to him to make war on the saints and to overcome them: and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and language and nation.";
B._Rev13_8="And all who are on the earth will give him worship, everyone whose name has not been from the first in the book of life of the Lamb who was put to death.";
B._Rev13_9="If any man has ears, let him give ear.";
B._Rev13_10="If any man sends others into prison, into prison he will go: if any man puts to death with the sword, with the sword will he be put to death. Here is the quiet strength and the faith of the saints.";
B._Rev13_11="And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and his voice was like that of a dragon.";
B._Rev13_12="And he makes use of all the authority of the first beast before his eyes. And he makes the earth and those who are in it give worship to the first beast, whose death-wound was made well.";
B._Rev13_13="And he does great signs, even making fire come down from heaven on the earth before the eyes of men.";
B._Rev13_14="And those who are on the earth are turned from the true way by him through the signs which he was given power to do before the beast; giving orders to those who are on the earth to make an image to the beast, who was wounded by the sword, and came to life.";
B._Rev13_15="And he had power to give breath to the image of the beast, so that words might come from the image of the beast, and that he might have all those who did not give worship to the image of the beast put to death.";
B._Rev13_16="And he gives to all, small and great, the poor and those who have wealth, the free and those who are not free, a mark on their right hand or on their brows;";
B._Rev13_17="So that no man might be able to do trade but he who has the mark, even the name of the beast or the number of his name.";
B._Rev13_18="Here is wisdom. He who has knowledge let him get the number of the beast; because it is the number of a man: and his number is Six hundred and sixty-six.";
B._Rev14_1="And I saw the Lamb on the mountain of Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, marked on their brows with his name and the name of his Father.";
B._Rev14_2="And a voice from heaven came to my ears, like the sound of great waters, and the sound of loud thunder: and the voice which came to me was like the sound of players, playing on instruments of music.";
B._Rev14_3="And they made as it seemed a new song before the high seat, and before the four beasts and the rulers: and no man might have knowledge of the song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, even those from the earth whom God has made his for a price.";
B._Rev14_4="These are they who have not made themselves unclean with women; for they are virgins. These are they who go after the Lamb wherever he goes. These were taken from among men to be the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.";
B._Rev14_5="And in their mouth there was no false word, for they are untouched by evil.";
B._Rev14_6="And I saw another angel in flight between heaven and earth, having eternal good news to give to those who are on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and language and people,";
B._Rev14_7="Saying with a loud voice, Have fear of God and give him glory; because the hour of his judging is come; and give worship to him who made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of water.";
B._Rev14_8="And a second angel came after, saying, Destruction has come to Babylon the great, which gave to all the nations the wine of the wrath of her evil ways.";
B._Rev14_9="And a third angel came after them, saying with a loud voice, If any man gives worship to the beast and his image, and has his mark on his brow or on his hand,";
B._Rev14_10="To him will be given of the wine of God's wrath which is ready unmixed in the cup of his wrath and he will have cruel pain, burning with fire before the holy angels and before the Lamb:";
B._Rev14_11="And the smoke of their pain goes up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, who give worship to the beast and his image, and have on them the mark of his name.";
B._Rev14_12="Here is the quiet strength of the saints, who keep the orders of God, and the faith of Jesus.";
B._Rev14_13="And a voice from heaven came to my ears, saying, Put in writing, There is a blessing on the dead who from now on come to their end in the Lord: yes, says the Spirit, that they may have rest from their troubles; for their works go with them.";
B._Rev14_14="And I saw a white cloud, and on the cloud I saw one seated, like a son of man, having on his head a crown of gold, and in his hand a sharp curved blade.";
B._Rev14_15="And another angel came out from the house of God, crying with a loud voice to him who was seated on the cloud, Put in your blade, and let the grain be cut: because the hour for cutting it is come; for the grain of the earth is over-ready.";
B._Rev14_16="And he who was seated on the cloud sent in his blade on the earth; and the grain of the earth was cut.";
B._Rev14_17="And another angel came out from the house of God which is in heaven, having a sharp curved blade.";
B._Rev14_18="And another angel came out from the altar, who has power over fire; and he gave a loud cry to him who had the sharp curved blade, saying, Put in your sharp blade, and let the grapes of the vine of the earth be cut; for her grapes are fully ready.";
B._Rev14_19="And the angel sent his blade into the earth, and the vine of the earth was cut, and he put it into the great wine-crusher of the wrath of God.";
B._Rev14_20="And the grapes were crushed under foot outside the town, and blood came out from them, even to the head-bands of the horses, two hundred miles.";
B._Rev15_1="And I saw another sign in heaven, great and strange; seven angels having the seven last punishments, for in them the wrath of God is complete.";
B._Rev15_2="And I saw a sea which seemed like glass mixed with fire; and those who had overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name, were in their places by the sea of glass, with God's instruments of music in their hands.";
B._Rev15_3="And they give the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and full of wonder are your works, O Lord God, Ruler of all; true and full of righteousness are your ways, eternal King.";
B._Rev15_4="What man is there who will not have fear before you, O Lord, and give glory to your name? because you only are holy; for all the nations will come and give worship before you; for your righteousness has been made clear.";
