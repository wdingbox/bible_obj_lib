B._1Co12_12="For as the body is one, and has a number of parts, and all the parts make one body, so is Christ.";
B._1Co12_13="For through the baptism of the one Spirit we were all formed into one body, Jews or Greeks, servants or free men, and were all made full of the same Spirit.";
B._1Co12_14="For the body is not one part, but a number of parts.";
B._1Co12_15="If the foot says, Because I am not the hand, I am not a part of the body; it is no less a part of the body.";
B._1Co12_16="And if the ear says, Because I am not the eye, I am not a part of the body; it is a part of the body all the same.";
B._1Co12_17="If all the body was an eye, where would be the hearing? if all was hearing, where would be the smelling?";
B._1Co12_18="But now God has put every one of the parts in the body as it was pleasing to him.";
B._1Co12_19="And if they were all one part, where would the body be?";
B._1Co12_20="But now they are all different parts, but one body.";
B._1Co12_21="And the eye may not say to the hand, I have no need of you: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.";
B._1Co12_22="No, those parts which seem to be feeble are the more necessary;";
B._1Co12_23="And to those parts of the body which seem to have less honour we give all the more honour; and to those parts of the body which are a cause of shame to us we give the greater respect;";
B._1Co12_24="But those parts of the body which are beautiful have no need of such care: and so the body has been joined together by God in such a way as to give more honour to those parts which had need of it;";
B._1Co12_25="So that there might be no division in the body; but all the parts might have the same care for one another.";
B._1Co12_26="And if there is pain in one part of the body, all the parts will be feeling it; or if one part is honoured, all the parts will be glad.";
B._1Co12_27="Now you are the body of Christ, and every one of you the separate parts of it.";
B._1Co12_28="And God has put some in the church, first, Apostles; second, prophets; third, teachers; then those with wonder-working powers, then those with the power of taking away disease, helpers, wise guides, users of strange tongues.";
B._1Co12_29="Are all Apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? have all the power of working wonders?";
B._1Co12_30="Are all able to take away disease? have all the power of tongues? are all able to give their sense?";
B._1Co12_31="But let your desires be turned to the more important things given by the Spirit. And now I am pointing out to you an even better way.";
B._1Co13_1="If I make use of the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am like sounding brass, or a loud-tongued bell.";
B._1Co13_2="And if I have a prophet's power, and have knowledge of all secret things; and if I have all faith, by which mountains may be moved from their place, but have not love, I am nothing.";
B._1Co13_3="And if I give all my goods to the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it is of no profit to me.";
B._1Co13_4="Love is never tired of waiting; love is kind; love has no envy; love has no high opinion of itself, love has no pride;";
B._1Co13_5="Love's ways are ever fair, it takes no thought for itself; it is not quickly made angry, it takes no account of evil;";
B._1Co13_6="It takes no pleasure in wrongdoing, but has joy in what is true;";
B._1Co13_7="Love has the power of undergoing all things, having faith in all things, hoping all things.";
B._1Co13_8="Though the prophet's word may come to an end, tongues come to nothing, and knowledge have no more value, love has no end.";
B._1Co13_9="For our knowledge is only in part, and the prophet's word gives only a part of what is true:";
B._1Co13_10="But when that which is complete is come, then that which is in part will be no longer necessary.";
B._1Co13_11="When I was a child, I made use of a child's language, I had a child's feelings and a child's thoughts: now that I am a man, I have put away the things of a child.";
B._1Co13_12="For now we see things in a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now my knowledge is in part; then it will be complete, even as God's knowledge of me.";
B._1Co13_13="But now we still have faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.";
B._1Co14_1="Go after love; still desiring to have the things which the Spirit gives, but most of all that you may have the prophet's power.";
B._1Co14_2="For he who makes use of tongues is not talking to men but to God; because no one has the sense of what he is saying; but in the Spirit he is talking of secret things.";
B._1Co14_3="But the word of the prophet gives men knowledge and comfort and strength.";
B._1Co14_4="He who makes use of tongues may do good to himself; but he who gives the prophet's word does good to the church.";
B._1Co14_5="Now though it is my desire for you all to have the power of tongues, it would give me more pleasure to be hearing the prophet's word from you; for this is a greater thing than using tongues, if the sense is not given at the same time, for the good of the church.";
B._1Co14_6="But, now, my brothers, if I come to you using tongues, what profit will it be to you, if I do not give you a revelation, or knowledge, or the word of the prophet, or teaching?";
B._1Co14_7="Even things without life, having a voice, such as a music-pipe or other instrument, if they do not give out different sounds, who may be certain what is being played?";
B._1Co14_8="For if the war-horn gives out an uncertain note, who will get ready for the fight?";
B._1Co14_9="So if you, in using a strange tongue, say words which have no sense, how will anyone take in what you are saying? for you will be talking to the air.";
B._1Co14_10="There are, it may be, a number of different voices in the world, and no voice is without sense.";
B._1Co14_11="But if the sense of the voice is not clear to me, I am like a man from a strange country to him who is talking, and he will be the same to me.";
B._1Co14_12="So if you are desiring the things which the Spirit gives, let your minds be turned first to the things which are for the good of the church.";
B._1Co14_13="For this reason, let the man who has the power of using tongues make request that he may, at the same time, be able to give the sense.";
B._1Co14_14="For if I make use of tongues in my prayers, my spirit makes the prayer, but not my mind.";
B._1Co14_15="What then? let my prayer be from the spirit, and equally from the mind; let my song be from the spirit, and equally from mind.";
B._1Co14_16="For if you give a blessing with the spirit, how will the man who has no knowledge say, So be it, after your prayer, seeing that he has not taken in what you are saying?";
B._1Co14_17="For your giving of the blessing is certainly well done, but of no profit to the man without knowledge.";
B._1Co14_18="I give praise to God that I am able to make use of tongues more than you all:";
B._1Co14_19="But in the church it would be better for me to make use of five words of which the sense was clear, so that others might have profit, than ten thousand words in a strange tongue.";
B._1Co14_20="My brothers, do not be children in mind: in evil be as little children, but in mind be of full growth.";
B._1Co14_21="In the law it is said, By men of other tongues and by strange lips will my words come to this people; and not even so will they give ear to me, says the Lord.";
B._1Co14_22="For this reason tongues are for a sign, not to those who have faith, but to those who have not: but the prophet's word is for those who have faith, and not for the rest who have not.";
B._1Co14_23="If, then, the church has come together, and all are using tongues, and there come in men without knowledge or faith, will they not say that you are unbalanced?";
B._1Co14_24="But if all are teaching as prophets, and a man without faith or knowledge comes in, he is tested by all, he is judged by all;";
B._1Co14_25="The secrets of his heart are made clear; and he will go down on his face and give worship to God, saying that God is truly among you.";
B._1Co14_26="What is it then, my brothers? when you come together everyone has a holy song, or a revelation, or a tongue, or is giving the sense of it. Let everything be done for the common good.";
B._1Co14_27="If any man makes use of a tongue, let it not be more than two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let someone give the sense:";
B._1Co14_28="But if there is no one to give the sense, let him keep quiet in the church; and let his words be to himself and to God.";
B._1Co14_29="And let the prophets give their words, but not more than two or three, and let the others be judges of what they say.";
B._1Co14_30="But if a revelation is given to another who is seated near, let the first be quiet.";
B._1Co14_31="For you may all be prophets in turn so that all may get knowledge and comfort;";
B._1Co14_32="And the spirits of the prophets are controlled by the prophets;";
B._1Co14_33="For God is not a God whose ways are without order, but a God of peace; as in all the churches of the saints.";
B._1Co14_34="Let women keep quiet in the churches: for it is not right for them to be talking; but let them be under control, as it says in the law.";
B._1Co14_35="And if they have a desire for knowledge about anything, let them put questions to their husbands privately: for talking in the church puts shame on a woman.";
B._1Co14_36="What? was it from you that the word of God went out? or did it only come in to you?";
B._1Co14_37="If any man seems to himself to be a prophet or to have the Spirit, let him take note of the things which I am writing to you, as being the word of the Lord.";
B._1Co14_38="But if any man is without knowledge, let him be so.";
B._1Co14_39="So then, my brothers, let it be your chief desire to be prophets; but let no one be stopped from using tongues.";
B._1Co14_40="Let all things be done in the right and ordered way.";
B._1Co15_1="Now I am going to make clear to you, my brothers, what the good news was which I gave to you, and which you took, and on which your faith is based,";
B._1Co15_2="By which you have salvation; that is to say, the form in which it was given to you, if it is fixed in your minds, and if your faith in it is not without effect.";
B._1Co15_3="For I gave to you first of all what was handed down to me, how Christ underwent death for our sins, as it says in the Writings;";
B._1Co15_4="And he was put in the place of the dead; and on the third day he came back from the dead, as it says in the Writings;";
B._1Co15_5="And he was seen by Cephas; then by the twelve;";
B._1Co15_6="Then by more than five hundred brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, but some are sleeping;";
B._1Co15_7="Then he was seen by James; then by all the Apostles.";
B._1Co15_8="And last of all, as by one whose birth was out of the right time, he was seen by me.";
B._1Co15_9="For I am the least of the Apostles, having no right to be named an Apostle, because of my cruel attacks on the church of God.";
B._1Co15_10="But by the grace of God, I am what I am: and his grace which was given to me has not been for nothing; for I did more work than all of them; though not I, but the grace of God which was with me.";
B._1Co15_11="If then it is I who am the preacher, or they, this is our word, and to this you have given your faith.";
B._1Co15_12="Now if the good news says that Christ came back from the dead, how do some of you say that there is no coming back from the dead?";
B._1Co15_13="But if there is no coming back from the dead, then Christ has not come back from the dead:";
B._1Co15_14="And if Christ did not come again from the dead, then our good news and your faith in it are of no effect.";
B._1Co15_15="Yes, and we are seen to be false witnesses of God; because we gave witness of God that by his power Christ came again from the dead: which is not true if there is no coming back from the dead.";
B._1Co15_16="For if it is not possible for the dead to come to life again, then Christ has not come to life again:";
B._1Co15_17="And if that is so, your faith is of no effect; you are still in your sins.";
B._1Co15_18="And, in addition, the dead in Christ have gone to destruction.";
B._1Co15_19="If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most unhappy.";
B._1Co15_20="But now Christ has truly come back from the dead, the first-fruits of those who are sleeping.";
B._1Co15_21="For as by man came death, so by man there is a coming back from the dead.";
B._1Co15_22="For as in Adam death comes to all, so in Christ will all come back to life.";
B._1Co15_23="But every man in his right order: Christ the first-fruits; then those who are Christ's at his coming.";
B._1Co15_24="Then comes the end, when he will give up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have put an end to all rule and to all authority and power.";
B._1Co15_25="For his rule will go on till he has put all those who are against him under his feet.";
B._1Co15_26="The last power to come to an end is death.";
B._1Co15_27="For, as it says, He has put all things under his feet. But when he says, All things are put under him, it is clear that it is not said about him who put all things under him.";
B._1Co15_28="And when all things have been put under him, then will the Son himself be under him who put all things under him, so that God may be all in all.";
B._1Co15_29="Again, what will they do who are given baptism for the dead? if the dead do not come back at all, why are people given baptism for them?";
B._1Co15_30="And why are we in danger every hour?";
B._1Co15_31="Yes, truly, by your pride in me, my brothers in Christ Jesus our Lord, my life is one long death.";
B._1Co15_32="If, after the way of men, I was fighting with beasts at Ephesus, what profit is it to me? If the dead do not come to life again, let us take our pleasure in feasting, for tomorrow we come to an end.";
B._1Co15_33="Do not be tricked by false words: evil company does damage to good behaviour.";
B._1Co15_34="Be awake to righteousness and keep yourselves from sin; for some have no knowledge of God: I say this to put you to shame.";
B._1Co15_35="But someone will say, How do the dead come back? and with what sort of body do they come?";
B._1Co15_36="Foolish man, it is necessary for the seed which you put into the earth to undergo death in order that it may come to life again:";
B._1Co15_37="And when you put it into the earth, you do not put in the body which it will be, but only the seed, of grain or some other sort of plant;";
B._1Co15_38="But God gives it a body, as it is pleasing to him, and to every seed its special body.";
B._1Co15_39="All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one flesh of men, another of beasts, another of birds, and another of fishes.";
B._1Co15_40="And there are bodies of heaven and bodies of earth, but the glory of the one is different from that of the other.";
B._1Co15_41="There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for the glory of one star is different from that of another.";
B._1Co15_42="So is it with the coming back from the dead. It is planted in death; it comes again in life:";
B._1Co15_43="It is planted in shame; it comes again in glory: feeble when it is planted, it comes again in power:";
B._1Co15_44="It is planted a natural body; it comes again as a body of the spirit. If there is a natural body, there is equally a body of the spirit.";
B._1Co15_45="And so it is said, The first man Adam was a living soul. The last Adam is a life-giving spirit.";
B._1Co15_46="But that which is natural comes before that which is of the spirit.";
B._1Co15_47="The first man is from the earth, and of the earth: the second man is from heaven.";
B._1Co15_48="Those who are of the earth are like the man who was from the earth: and those who are of heaven are like the one from heaven.";
B._1Co15_49="And in the same way as we have taken on us the image of the man from the earth, so we will take on us the image of the one from heaven.";
B._1Co15_50="Now I say this, my brothers, that it is not possible for flesh and blood to have a part in the kingdom of God; and death may not have a part in life.";
B._1Co15_51="See, I am giving you the revelation of a secret: we will not all come to the sleep of death, but we will all be changed.";
B._1Co15_52="In a second, in the shutting of an eye, at the sound of the last horn: for at that sound the dead will come again, free for ever from the power of death, and we will be changed.";
B._1Co15_53="For this body which comes to destruction will be made free from the power of death, and the man who is under the power of death will put on eternal life.";
B._1Co15_54="But when this has taken place, then that which was said in the Writings will come true, Death is overcome by life.";
B._1Co15_55="O death, where is your power? O death, where are your pains?";
B._1Co15_56="The pain of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:";
B._1Co15_57="But praise be to God who gives us strength to overcome through our Lord Jesus Christ.";
B._1Co15_58="For this cause, my dear brothers, be strong in purpose and unmoved, ever giving yourselves to the work of the Lord, because you are certain that your work is not without effect in the Lord.";
B._1Co16_1="Now about the giving of money for the saints, as I gave orders to the churches of Galatia, so do you.";
B._1Co16_2="On the first day of the week, let every one of you put by him in store, in measure as he has done well in business, so that it may not be necessary to get money together when I come.";
B._1Co16_3="And when I come, I will send the men of your selection with letters to take the money you have got together to Jerusalem.";
B._1Co16_4="And if it is possible for me to go there, they will go with me.";
B._1Co16_5="But I will come to you after I have gone through Macedonia, for that is my purpose;";
B._1Co16_6="But I may be with you for a time, or even for the winter, so that you may see me on my way, wherever I go.";
B._1Co16_7="For it is not my desire to see you now, on my way; because it is my hope to be with you for some time, if that is the Lord's pleasure.";
B._1Co16_8="But I will be at Ephesus till Pentecost;";
B._1Co16_9="For a great and important door there is open to me, and there are a number of people against me.";
B._1Co16_10="Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear; because he is doing the Lord's work, even as I am:";
B._1Co16_11="See then that he has the honour which is right. But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me: for I am looking for him with the brothers.";
B._1Co16_12="But as for Apollos, the brother, I had a great desire for him to come to you with the brothers, but it was not his pleasure to come now; but he will come when he has a chance.";
B._1Co16_13="Be on the watch, unmoved in the faith, and be strong like men.";
B._1Co16_14="Let all you do be done in love.";
B._1Co16_15="Now I make my request to you, my brothers, for you have knowledge that the house of Stephanas is the first-fruits of Achaia, and that they have made themselves the servants of the saints,";
B._1Co16_16="That you put yourselves under such, and under everyone who is helping the Lord's work.";
B._1Co16_17="And I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for they have done what was needed to make your work complete.";
B._1Co16_18="For they gave comfort to my spirit and to yours: for which cause give respect to such people.";
B._1Co16_19="The churches of Asia send their love to you. So do Aquila and Prisca, with the church which is in their house.";
B._1Co16_20="All the brothers send their love to you. Give one another a holy kiss.";
B._1Co16_21="I, Paul, send you these words of love in my writing.";
B._1Co16_22="If any man has not love for the Lord, let him be cursed. Maran atha (our Lord comes).";
B._1Co16_23="The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.";
B._1Co16_24="My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. So be it.";
B._2Co1_1="Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose of God, and Timothy the brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:";
B._2Co1_2="Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.";
B._2Co1_3="Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort;";
B._2Co1_4="Who gives us comfort in all our troubles, so that we may be able to give comfort to others who are in trouble, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.";
B._2Co1_5="For as we undergo more of the pain which Christ underwent, so through Christ does our comfort become greater.";
B._2Co1_6="But if we are troubled, it is for your comfort and salvation; or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which takes effect through your quiet undergoing of the same troubles which we undergo:";
B._2Co1_7="And our hope for you is certain; in the knowledge that as you take part in the troubles, so you will take part in the comfort.";
B._2Co1_8="For it is our desire that you may not be without knowledge of our trouble which came on us in Asia, that the weight of it was very great, more than our power, so that it seemed that we had no hope even of life:";
B._2Co1_9="Yes, we ourselves have had the answer of death in ourselves, so that our hope might not be in ourselves, but in God who is able to give life to the dead:";
B._2Co1_10="Who gave us salvation from so great a death: on whom we have put our hope that he will still go on to give us salvation;";
B._2Co1_11="You at the same time helping together by your prayer for us; so that for what has been given to us through a number of persons, praise may go up to God for us from all of them.";
B._2Co1_12="For our glory is in this, in the knowledge which we have that our way of life in the world, and most of all in relation to you, has been holy and true in the eyes of God; not in the wisdom of the flesh, but in the grace of God.";
B._2Co1_13="For in our letters we say no other things to you, but those which you are reading, and to which you give agreement, and, it is my hope, will go on doing so to the end:";
B._2Co1_14="Even as you have been ready, in part, to say that we are your glory, in the same way that you are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.";
B._2Co1_15="And being certain of this, it was my purpose to come to you before, so that you might have a second grace;";
B._2Co1_16="And by way of Corinth to go into Macedonia, and from there to come back again to you, so that you might send me on my way to Judaea.";
B._2Co1_17="If then I had such a purpose, did I seem to be changing suddenly? or am I guided in my purposes by the flesh, saying, Yes, today, and, No, tomorrow?";
B._2Co1_18="As God is true, our word to you is not Yes and No.";
B._2Co1_19="For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we were preaching among you, even I and Silvanus and Timothy, was not Yes and No, but in him is Yes.";
B._2Co1_20="For he is the Yes to all the undertakings of God: and by him all the words of God are made certain and put into effect, to the glory of God through us.";
B._2Co1_21="Now he who makes our faith strong together with you, in Christ, and has given us of his grace, is God;";
B._2Co1_22="And it is he who has put his stamp on us, even the Spirit, as the sign in our hearts of the coming glory.";
B._2Co1_23="But God is my witness that it was in pity for you that I did not come to Corinth at that time.";
B._2Co1_24="Not that we have authority over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy: for it is faith which is your support.";
B._2Co2_1="But it was my decision for myself, not to come again to you with sorrow.";
B._2Co2_2="For if I give you sorrow, who then will make me glad, but he who is made sad by me?";
B._2Co2_3="And I said this very thing in my letter, for fear that when I came I might have sorrow from those from whom it was right for me to have joy; being certain of this, that my joy is the joy of you all.";
B._2Co2_4="For out of much trouble and pain of heart and much weeping I sent my letter to you; not to give you sorrow, but so that you might see how great is the love which I have to you.";
B._2Co2_5="But if anyone has been a cause of sorrow, he has been so, not to me only, but in some measure to all of you (I say this that I may not be over-hard on you).";
B._2Co2_6="Let it be enough for such a man to have undergone the punishment which the church put on him;";
B._2Co2_7="So that now, on the other hand, it is right for him to have forgiveness and comfort from you, for fear that his sorrow may be over-great.";
B._2Co2_8="For which cause my desire is that you will make your love to him clear by your acts.";
B._2Co2_9="And for the same reason I sent you a letter so that I might be certain of your desire to do my orders in all things.";
B._2Co2_10="But if you give forgiveness to anyone, I do the same: for if I have given forgiveness for anything, I have done it because of you, in the person of Christ;";
B._2Co2_11="So that Satan may not get the better of us: for we are not without knowledge of his designs.";
