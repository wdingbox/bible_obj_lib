B._1Sa17_29="And David said, What have I done now? was it not only a word?";
B._1Sa17_30="And turning away from him to one of the other men, he said the same words: and the people gave him the same answer.";
B._1Sa17_31="And, hearing what David said, they gave Saul word of it: and he sent for him.";
B._1Sa17_32="And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart become feeble because of him; I, your servant, will go out and have a fight with this Philistine.";
B._1Sa17_33="And Saul said to David, You are not able to go out against this Philistine and have a fight with him: for you are only a boy, and he has been a man of war from his earliest days.";
B._1Sa17_34="And David said to Saul, Your servant has been keeper of his father's sheep; and if a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock,";
B._1Sa17_35="I went out after him, and overcame him, and took it out of his mouth: and if, turning on me, he came at me, I took him by the hair and overcame him and put him to death.";
B._1Sa17_36="Your servant has overcome lion and bear: and the fate of this Philistine, who is without circumcision, will be like theirs, seeing that he has put shame on the armies of the living God.";
B._1Sa17_37="And David said, The Lord, who kept me safe from the grip of the lion and the bear, will be my saviour from the hands of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go! and may the Lord be with you.";
B._1Sa17_38="Then Saul gave David his clothing of war, and put a head-dress of brass on his head and had him clothed with a coat of metal.";
B._1Sa17_39="And David took Saul's sword and put the band round him over the metal coat, and was unable to go forward; for he was not used to them. Then David said to Saul, It is not possible for me to go out with these, for I am not used to them. So David took them off.";
B._1Sa17_40="Then he took his stick in his hand, and got five smooth stones from the bed of the stream and put them in a bag such as is used by sheep-keepers; and in his hand was a leather band used for sending stones: and so he went in the direction of the Philistine.";
B._1Sa17_41="And the Philistine came nearer to David; and the man who had his body-cover went before him.";
B._1Sa17_42="And when the Philistine, taking note, saw David, he had a poor opinion of him: for he was only a boy, red-haired and good-looking.";
B._1Sa17_43="And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come out to me with sticks? And the Philistine put curses on David by all his gods.";
B._1Sa17_44="And the Philistine said to David, Come here to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field.";
B._1Sa17_45="Then David said to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin: but I come to you in the name of the Lord of armies, the God of the armies of Israel on which you have put shame.";
B._1Sa17_46="This day the Lord will give you up into my hands, and I will overcome you, and take your head off you; and I will give the bodies of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth today, so that all the earth may see that Israel has a God;";
B._1Sa17_47="And all these people who are here today may see that the Lord does not give salvation by sword and spear: for the fight is the Lord's, and he will give you up into our hands.";
B._1Sa17_48="Now when the Philistine made a move and came near to David, David quickly went at a run in the direction of the army, meeting the Philistine face to face.";
B._1Sa17_49="And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and sent it from his leather band straight at the Philistine, and the stone went deep into his brow, and he went down to the earth, falling on his face.";
B._1Sa17_50="So David overcame the Philistine with his leather band and a stone, wounding the Philistine and causing his death: but David had no sword in his hand.";
B._1Sa17_51="So running up to the Philistine and putting his foot on him, David took his sword out of its cover, and put him to death, cutting off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that their fighter was dead, they went in flight.";
B._1Sa17_52="And the men of Israel and of Judah got up, and gave a cry, and went after the Philistines as far as Gath and the town doors of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines were falling down by the road from Shaaraim all the way to Gath and Ekron.";
B._1Sa17_53="Then the children of Israel came back from going after the Philistines, and took their goods from the tents.";
B._1Sa17_54="And David took the head of the Philistine to Jerusalem, but the metal war-dress and the arms he put in his tent.";
B._1Sa17_55="And when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, Abner, whose son is this young man? And Abner said, On your life, O king, I have no idea.";
B._1Sa17_56="And the king said, Make search and see whose son this young man is.";
B._1Sa17_57="And when David was coming back after the destruction of the Philistine, Abner took him to Saul, with the head of the Philistine in his hand.";
B._1Sa17_58="And Saul said to him, Young man, whose son are you? And David in answer said, I am the son of your servant Jesse of Beth-lehem.";
B._1Sa18_1="Now after David's talk with Saul was ended, the soul of Jonathan was joined with the soul of David, and David became as dear to him as his very life.";
B._1Sa18_2="And that day Saul took David and would not let him go back to his father's house.";
B._1Sa18_3="Then Jonathan and David made an agreement together, because of Jonathan's love for David.";
B._1Sa18_4="And Jonathan took off the robe he had on and gave it to David, with all his military dress, even to his sword and his bow and the band round his body.";
B._1Sa18_5="And David went wherever Saul sent him, and did wisely: and Saul put him at the head of his men of war, and this was pleasing to all the people as well as to Saul's servants.";
B._1Sa18_6="Now on their way, when David came back after the destruction of the Philistine, the women came out of all the towns of Israel, with songs and dances, meeting David with melody and joy and instruments of music.";
B._1Sa18_7="And the women, answering one another in their song, said, Saul has put to death his thousands and David his tens of thousands.";
B._1Sa18_8="And Saul was very angry and this saying was unpleasing to him; and he said, They have given David credit for tens of thousands, and to me for only thousands: what more is there for him but the kingdom?";
B._1Sa18_9="And from that day Saul was looking with envy on David.";
B._1Sa18_10="Now on the day after, an evil spirit from God came on Saul with great force and he was acting like a prophet among the men of his house, while David was making music for him, as he did day by day: and Saul had his spear in his hand.";
B._1Sa18_11="And Saul, balancing the spear in his hand, said, I will give David a blow, pinning him to the wall. And David got away from him twice.";
B._1Sa18_12="And Saul went in fear of David, because the Lord was with David and had gone away from Saul.";
B._1Sa18_13="So Saul sent him away, and made him a captain over a thousand; and he went about his business before the people.";
B._1Sa18_14="And in all his undertakings David did wisely; and the Lord was with him.";
B._1Sa18_15="And when Saul saw how wisely he did, he was in fear of him.";
B._1Sa18_16="But David was loved by all Israel and Judah, for he went out and came in before them.";
B._1Sa18_17="And Saul said to David, Here is my oldest daughter Merab, whom I will give you for your wife: only be strong for me, fighting in the Lord's wars. For Saul said, Let it not be through me that his fate comes to him, but through the Philistines.";
B._1Sa18_18="And David said to Saul, Who am I, and what is my father's family in Israel, that I am to be son-in-law to the king?";
B._1Sa18_19="But when the time came to give Merab, Saul's daughter, to David, she was given to Adriel of Meholath.";
B._1Sa18_20="And Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David: and Saul had word of it and was pleased.";
B._1Sa18_21="And Saul said, I will give her to him, so that she may be a cause of danger to him, and so that the hands of the Philistines may be against him. So Saul said to David, Today you are to become my son-in-law for the second time.";
B._1Sa18_22="And Saul gave his servants orders saying, Have talk with David secretly and say to him, See how the king has delight in you, and how you are loved by all his servants: then be the king's son-in-law.";
B._1Sa18_23="And Saul's servants said these things to David. And David said, Does it seem to you a small thing to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, of no great name?";
B._1Sa18_24="And the servants of Saul gave him an account of what David had said.";
B._1Sa18_25="And Saul said, Then say to David, The king has no desire for any bride-price, but only for the private parts of a hundred Philistines so that the king may get the better of his haters. But it was in Saul's mind that David might come to his end by the hands of the Philistines.";
B._1Sa18_26="And when his servants said these words to David, he was well pleased to be the son-in-law of the king. And the days were still not past.";
B._1Sa18_27="So David and his men got up and went, and put to death two hundred of the Philistines; and David took their private parts and gave the full number of them to the king, so that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for his wife.";
B._1Sa18_28="And it was clear to Saul that the Lord was with David; and he was loved by all Israel.";
B._1Sa18_29="And Saul's fear of David became all the greater, and he went on hating him, day by day.";
B._1Sa18_30="Then the rulers of the Philistines went out to war: and whenever they went out, David did more wisely than all the other servants of Saul, so that his name became greatly honoured.";
B._1Sa19_1="And Saul gave orders to his son Jonathan and to all his servants to put David to death. But Saul's son Jonathan had great delight in David.";
B._1Sa19_2="And Jonathan said to David, Saul, my father, is purposing your death: so now, take care in the morning, and keep yourself safe in a secret place:";
B._1Sa19_3="And I will go out and take my place by my father's side in the field near where you are; and I will get into talk with my father about you, and when I see how things are, I will give you word.";
B._1Sa19_4="And Jonathan gave his father Saul a good account of David, and said to him, Let not the king do wrong against his servant, against David; because he has done you no wrong, and all his acts have had a good outcome for you:";
B._1Sa19_5="For he put his life in danger and overcame the Philistine, and the Lord gave all Israel salvation: you saw it and were glad: why then are you sinning against him who has done no wrong, desiring the death of David without cause?";
B._1Sa19_6="And Saul gave ear to the voice of Jonathan, and said with an oath, By the living Lord, he is not to be put to death.";
B._1Sa19_7="Then Jonathan sent for David and gave him word of all these things. And Jonathan took David to Saul, who kept him by his side as in the past.";
B._1Sa19_8="And there was war again: and David went out fighting the Philistines, causing great destruction among them; and they went in flight before him.";
B._1Sa19_9="And an evil spirit from the Lord came on Saul, when he was seated in his house with his spear in his hand; and David made music for him.";
B._1Sa19_10="And Saul would have sent his spear through him, pinning him to the wall, but he got away and the spear went into the wall: and that night David went in flight and got away.";
B._1Sa19_11="Then in that night Saul sent men to David's house to keep watch on him so as to put him to death in the morning: and David's wife Michal said to him, If you do not go away to a safe place tonight you will be put to death in the morning.";
B._1Sa19_12="So Michal let David down through the window, and he went in flight and got away.";
B._1Sa19_13="Then Michal took the image and put it in the bed, with a cushion of goat's hair at its head, and she put clothing over it.";
B._1Sa19_14="And when Saul sent men to take David, she said, He is ill.";
B._1Sa19_15="And Saul sent his men to see David, saying, Do not come back without him, take him in his bed, so that I may put him to death.";
B._1Sa19_16="And when the men came in, there was the image in the bed, with the cushion of goat's hair at its head";
B._1Sa19_17="And Saul said to Michal, why have you been false to me, letting my hater go and get safely away? And in answer Michal said to Saul, He said to me, Let me go, or I will put you to death.";
B._1Sa19_18="So David went in flight and got away and came to Ramah, to Samuel, and gave him an account of all Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and were living in Naioth.";
B._1Sa19_19="And word was given to Saul that David was at Naioth in Ramah.";
B._1Sa19_20="And Saul sent men to take David; and when they saw the band of prophets at work, with Samuel in his place at their head, the spirit of God came on Saul's men, and they became like prophets.";
B._1Sa19_21="And Saul, having news of this, sent other men, who in the same way became like prophets. And a third time Saul sent men, and they like the others became like prophets.";
B._1Sa19_22="Then he himself went to Ramah, and came to the great water-spring in Secu; and questioning the people he said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, They are at Naioth in Ramah.";
B._1Sa19_23="And he went on from there to Naioth in Ramah: and the spirit of God came on him, and he went on, acting like a prophet, till he came to Naioth in Ramah.";
B._1Sa19_24="And he took off his clothing, acting like a prophet before Samuel, and falling down he was stretched out, without his clothing, all that day and all that night. This is the reason for the saying, Is even Saul among the prophets?";
B._1Sa20_1="And David went in flight from Naioth in Ramah and came to Jonathan and said, What have I done? What is my crime and my sin against your father that he is attempting to take my life?";
B._1Sa20_2="And he said to him, Far be the thought: you will not be put to death: see, my father does nothing, great or small, without giving me word of it: would he keep this secret from me? It is not so.";
B._1Sa20_3="But David took his oath again and said, Your father sees that I am dear to you; so he says to himself, Let Jonathan have no idea of this, for it will be a grief to him; but as the Lord is living, and as your soul is living, there is only a step between me and death.";
B._1Sa20_4="Then Jonathan said to David, Whatever your desire is, I will do it for you.";
B._1Sa20_5="And David said to Jonathan, Tomorrow is the new moon, and I will not be seated with the king at his table: but let me go to a safe place in the country till the evening.";
B._1Sa20_6="And if your father takes note of the fact that I am away, say, David made a request to me for himself that he might go to Beth-lehem, to his town: for it is the time when his family make their offering year by year.";
B._1Sa20_7="If he says, It is well, your servant will be at peace: but if he is angry, then it will be clear to you that he has an evil purpose in mind against me.";
B._1Sa20_8="So, then, be kind to your servant; for you have been united with your servant in an agreement made before the Lord: but if there is any wrongdoing in me, put me to death yourself; why take me to your father?";
B._1Sa20_9="And Jonathan said, Do not have such a thought: for if I saw that my father was designing evil against you, would I not give you word of it?";
B._1Sa20_10="Then David said to Jonathan, Who will give me word if your father gives you a rough answer?";
B._1Sa20_11="And Jonathan said to David, Come, let us go out into the country. And the two of them went out together into the open country.";
B._1Sa20_12="And Jonathan said to David, May the Lord, the God of Israel, be witness; when I have had a chance of talking to my father, about this time tomorrow, if his feelings to David are good, will I not send and give you the news?";
B._1Sa20_13="May the Lord's punishment be on Jonathan, if it is my father's pleasure to do you evil and I do not give you word of it and send you away so that you may go in peace: and may the Lord be with you, as he has been with my father.";
B._1Sa20_14="And may you, while I am still living, O may you be kind to me, as the Lord is kind, and keep me from death!";
B._1Sa20_15="And let not your mercy ever be cut off from my family, even when the Lord has sent destruction on all David's haters, cutting them off from the face of the earth.";
B._1Sa20_16="And if it comes about that the name of Jonathan is cut off from the family of David, the Lord will make David responsible.";
B._1Sa20_17="And Jonathan again took an oath to David, because of his love for him: for David was as dear to him as his very soul.";
B._1Sa20_18="Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon: and it will be seen that you are not present, for there will be no one in your seat.";
B._1Sa20_19="And on the third day it will be specially noted, and you will go to the place where you took cover when the other business was in hand, waiting by the hill over there.";
B._1Sa20_20="And on the third day I will send arrows from my bow against its side as if at a mark.";
B._1Sa20_21="And I will send my boy to have a look for the arrow. And if I say to him, See, the arrow is on this side of you; take it up! then you may come; for there is peace for you and no evil, by the living Lord.";
B._1Sa20_22="But if I say to the boy, See, the arrow has gone past you: then go on your way, for the Lord has sent you away.";
B._1Sa20_23="As for what you and I were talking of, the Lord is between you and me for ever.";
B._1Sa20_24="So David went to a secret place in the country: and when the new moon came, the king took his place at the feast.";
B._1Sa20_25="And the king took his seat, as at other times, by the wall: and Jonathan was in front, and Abner was seated by Saul's side, but there was no one in David's seat.";
B._1Sa20_26="But Saul said nothing that day, for his thought was, Something has taken place making him unclean; it is clear that he is not clean.";
B._1Sa20_27="And on the day after the new moon, that is, the second day, there was still no one in David's seat: and Saul said to his son Jonathan, Why has the son of Jesse not come to the feast yesterday or today?";
B._1Sa20_28="And answering Saul, Jonathan said, He made a request to me that he might go to Beth-lehem,";
B._1Sa20_29="Saying, Our family is making an offering in the town, and my brothers have given me orders to be there: so now, if I have grace in your eyes, let me go away and see my brothers. This is why he has not come to the king's table.";
B._1Sa20_30="Then Saul was moved to wrath against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of an evil and uncontrolled woman, have I not seen how you have given your love to the son of Jesse, to your shame and the shame of your mother?";
B._1Sa20_31="For while the son of Jesse is living on the earth, your position is unsafe and your kingdom is in danger. So make him come here to me, for it is certainly right for him to be put to death.";
B._1Sa20_32="And Jonathan, answering his father Saul, said to him, Why is he to be put to death? What has he done?";
B._1Sa20_33="And Saul, pointing his spear at him, made an attempt to give him a wound: from which it was clear to Jonathan that his father's purpose was to put David to death.";
B._1Sa20_34="So Jonathan got up from the table, burning with wrath, and took no part in the feast the second day of the month, being full of grief for David because his father had put shame on him.";
B._1Sa20_35="Now in the morning, Jonathan went out into the fields at the time he had said to David, and he had a little boy with him.";
B._1Sa20_36="And he said to the boy, Go and get the arrow I let loose from my bow. And while the boy was running, he sent an arrow past him.";
B._1Sa20_37="And when the boy came to the place where the arrow was, Jonathan, crying out after the boy, said, Has it not gone past you?";
B._1Sa20_38="And Jonathan went on crying out after the boy, Be quick, do not keep waiting about, go quickly. And Jonathan's boy got the arrow and came back to his master.";
B._1Sa20_39="But the boy had no idea what was going on; only Jonathan and David had knowledge of it.";
B._1Sa20_40="And Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy, and said to him, Take these and go back to the town.";
B._1Sa20_41="And when the boy had gone, David came from his secret place by the hill, and falling to the earth went down on his face three times: and they gave one another a kiss, weeping together, till David's grief was the greater.";
B._1Sa20_42="And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, for we two have taken an oath, in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord will be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed for ever. Then David went away, and Jonathan went into the town.";
B._1Sa21_1="Then David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was full of fear at meeting David, and said to him, Why are you by yourself, having no man with you?";
B._1Sa21_2="And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has given me orders and has said to me, Say nothing to anyone about the business on which I am sending you and the orders I have given you: and a certain place has been fixed to which the young men are to go.";
B._1Sa21_3="So now, if you have here five cakes of bread, give them into my hand, or whatever you have.";
B._1Sa21_4="And the priest, answering David, said, I have no common bread here but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.";
B._1Sa21_5="And David in answer said to the priest, Certainly women have been kept from us; and as has been done before when I have gone out the arms of the young men were made holy, even though it was a common journey; how much more today will their arms be made holy.";
B._1Sa21_6="So the priest gave him the holy bread: there was no other, only the holy bread which had been taken from before the Lord, so that new bread might be put in its place on the day when it was taken away.";
B._1Sa21_7="Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, kept back before the Lord; his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the strongest of Saul's runners.";
B._1Sa21_8="And David said to Ahimelech, Have you no sword or spear with you here? for I have come without my sword and other arms, because the king's business had to be done quickly.";
B._1Sa21_9="And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you put to death in the valley of Elah, is here folded in a cloth at the back of the ephod: take that, if you will, for there is no other sword here. And David said, there is no other sword like that; give it to me.";
B._1Sa21_10="Then David got up and went in flight that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish, the king of Gath.";
B._1Sa21_11="And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David, the king of the land? did they not make songs about him in their dances, saying, Saul has put to death thousands, and David tens of thousands?";
B._1Sa21_12="And David took these words to heart, fearing Achish, the king of Gath.";
B._1Sa21_13="So changing his behaviour before them, he made it seem as if he was off his head, hammering on the doors of the town, and letting the water from his mouth go down his chin.";
B._1Sa21_14="Then Achish said to his servants, Look! the man is clearly off his head; why have you let him come before me?";
B._1Sa21_15="Are there not enough unbalanced men about me, that you have let this person come and do such tricks before me? is such a man to come into my house?";
B._1Sa22_1="So David went away from there and took cover in a strong place at Adullam; and his brothers and all his father's people, hearing of it, went down to him there.";
B._1Sa22_2="And everyone who was in trouble, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was bitter in soul, came together to him, and he became captain over them: about four hundred men were joined to him.";
B._1Sa22_3="And from there David went to Mizpeh in the land of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and mother come and make their living-place with you till it is clear to me what God will do for me.";
B._1Sa22_4="And he took them to the king of Moab and they went on living with him while David was in his safe place.";
B._1Sa22_5="And the prophet Gad said to David, Do not go on living in this place but go into the land of Judah. Then David went away and came to the woodland of Hereth.";
B._1Sa22_6="And news was given to Saul that David had been seen, and the men who were with him: now Saul was in Gibeah, seated under the tree in the high place, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were in their places before him.";
B._1Sa22_7="Then Saul said to his servants who were there about him, Give ear now, you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give to every one of you fields and vine-gardens, will he make you all captains of hundreds and captains of thousands;";
