B._2Ki8_1="Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had given back to life, Go now, with all the people of your house, and get a living-place for yourselves wherever you are able; for by the word of the Lord, there will be great need of food in the land; and this will go on for seven years.";
B._2Ki8_2="So the woman got up and did as the man of God said; and she and the people of her house were living in the land of the Philistines for seven years.";
B._2Ki8_3="And when the seven years were ended, the woman came back from the land of the Philistines and went to the king with a request for her house and her land.";
B._2Ki8_4="Now the king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, Now, give me an account of all the great things Elisha has done.";
B._2Ki8_5="And while he was giving the king the story of how Elisha had given life to the dead, the woman whose son had come back to life came to the king with a request for her house and her land.

B._2Ki8_6="And in answer to the king's questions, the woman gave him all the story. So the king gave orders to one of his unsexed servants, saying, Give her back all her property, and all the produce of her fields from the day when she went away from the land up till now.";
B._2Ki8_7="And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad, king of Aram, was ill; and they said to him, The man of God has come.";
B._2Ki8_8="Then the king said to Hazael, Take an offering with you, and go to see the man of God and get directions from the Lord by him, saying, Am I going to get better from my disease?";
B._2Ki8_9="So Hazael went to see him, taking with him forty camels with offerings on their backs of every sort of good thing from Damascus; and when he came before him, he said, Your son Ben-hadad, king of Aram, has sent me to you, saying, Will I get better from this disease?";
B._2Ki8_10="And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, You will certainly get better; but the Lord has made it clear to me that only death is before him.";
B._2Ki8_11="And he kept his eyes fixed on him till he was shamed, and the man of God was overcome with weeping.";
B._2Ki8_12="And Hazael said, Why is my lord weeping?

B._2Ki8_13="And Hazael said, How is it possible that your servant, who is only a dog, will do this great thing? And Elisha said, The Lord has made it clear to me that you will be king over Aram.";
B._2Ki8_14="Then he went away from Elisha and came in to his master, who said to him, What did Elisha say to you? And his answer was, He said that you would certainly get well.";
B._2Ki8_15="Now on the day after, Hazael took the bed-cover, and making it wet with water, put it over Ben-hadad's face, causing his death: and Hazael became king in his place.";
B._2Ki8_16="In the fifth year of Joram, the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, became king.";
B._2Ki8_17="He was thirty-two years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for eight years.";
B._2Ki8_18="He went in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the family of Ahab did: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the eyes of the Lord.";

B._2Ki8_20="In his time, Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah, and took a king for themselves.";
B._2Ki8_21="Then Joram went over to Zair, with all his war-carriages; ... made an attack by night on the Edomites, whose forces were all round him, ... the captains of the war-carriages; and the people went in flight to their tents.";
B._2Ki8_22="So Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah to this day. And at the same time, Libnah made itself free.";

B._2Ki9_3="Then take the bottle and put the oil on his head, and say, The Lord says, I have put the holy oil on you to make you king over Israel. Then, opening the door, go in flight, without waiting.";
B._2Ki9_4="So the young prophet went to Ramoth-gilead.";
B._2Ki9_5="And when he came, he saw the captains of the army seated together; and he said, I have something to say to you, O captain. And Jehu said, To which of us? And he said, To you, O captain.";
B._2Ki9_6="And he got up and went into the house; then he put the holy oil on his head and said to him, The Lord, the God of Israel, says, I have made you king over the people of the Lord, over Israel.";
