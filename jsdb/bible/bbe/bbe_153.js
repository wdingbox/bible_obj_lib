B._Luk18_7="And will not God do right in the cause of his saints, whose cries come day and night to his ears, though he is long in doing it?";
B._Luk18_8="I say to you that he will quickly do right in their cause. But when the Son of man comes, will there be any faith on earth?";
B._Luk18_9="And he made this story for some people who were certain that they were good, and had a low opinion of others:";
B._Luk18_10="Two men went up to the Temple for prayer; one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-farmer.";
B._Luk18_11="The Pharisee, taking up his position, said to himself these words: God, I give you praise because I am not like other men, who take more than their right, who are evil-doers, who are untrue to their wives, or even like this tax-farmer.";
B._Luk18_12="Twice in the week I go without food; I give a tenth of all I have.";
B._Luk18_13="The tax-farmer, on the other hand, keeping far away, and not lifting up even his eyes to heaven, made signs of grief and said, God, have mercy on me, a sinner.";
B._Luk18_14="I say to you, This man went back to his house with God's approval, and not the other: for everyone who makes himself high will be made low and whoever makes himself low will be made high.";
B._Luk18_15="And they took their children to him, so that he might put his hands on them: but when the disciples saw it, they said sharp words to them";
B._Luk18_16="But Jesus sent for them, saying, Let the children come to me, and do not keep them away, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.";
B._Luk18_17="Truly I say to you, Whoever does not put himself under the kingdom of God like a little child, will not come into it at all.";
B._Luk18_18="And a certain ruler put a question to him, saying, Good Master, what have I to do so that I may have eternal life?";
B._Luk18_19="And Jesus said to him, Why do you say that I am good? No one is good, but only God.";
B._Luk18_20="You have knowledge of what the law says: Do not be untrue to your wife, Do not put anyone to death, Do not take what is not yours, Do not give false witness, Give honour to your father and mother.";
B._Luk18_21="And he said, All these things I have done from the time when I was a boy.";
B._Luk18_22="And Jesus, hearing it, said to him, One thing you still have need of; get money for your goods, and give it away to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; and come after me.";
B._Luk18_23="But at these words he became very sad, for he had great wealth.";
B._Luk18_24="And Jesus, looking at him, said, How hard it is for those who have wealth to get into the kingdom of God!";
B._Luk18_25="It is simpler for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a man who has much money to come into the kingdom of God.";
B._Luk18_26="And those who were present said, Then who may have salvation?";
B._Luk18_27="But he said, Things which are not possible with man are possible with God.";
B._Luk18_28="And Peter said, See, we have given up what is ours to come after you.";
B._Luk18_29="And he said to them, Truly I say to you, There is no man who has given up house or wife or brothers or father or mother or children, because of the kingdom of God,";
B._Luk18_30="Who will not get much more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life.";
B._Luk18_31="And he took with him the twelve and said to them, Now we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things which were said by the prophets will be done to the Son of man.";
B._Luk18_32="For he will be given up to the Gentiles, and will be made sport of and put to shame:";
B._Luk18_33="And he will be given cruel blows and put to death, and on the third day he will come back to life.";
B._Luk18_34="But they did not take in the sense of any of these words, and what he said was not clear to them, and their minds were not able to see it.";
B._Luk18_35="And it came about that when he got near Jericho, a certain blind man was seated by the side of the road, making requests for money from those who went by.";
B._Luk18_36="And hearing the sound of a great number of people going by, he said, What is this?";
B._Luk18_37="And they said to him, Jesus of Nazareth is going by.";
B._Luk18_38="And he said in a loud voice, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.";
B._Luk18_39="And those who were in front made protests and said to him, Be quiet: but he said all the more, O Son of David, have mercy on me.";
B._Luk18_40="And Jesus, stopping, gave orders that he was to come to him, and when he came near, he said to him,";
B._Luk18_41="What would you have me do for you? And he said, Lord, that I may be able to see again.";
B._Luk18_42="And Jesus said, See again: your faith has made you well.";
B._Luk18_43="And straight away he was able to see, and he went after him, giving glory to God; and all the people when they saw it gave praise to God.";
B._Luk19_1="And he went into Jericho, and when he was going through it,";
B._Luk19_2="A man, named Zacchaeus, who was the chief tax-farmer, and a man of wealth,";
B._Luk19_3="Made an attempt to get a view of Jesus, and was not able to do so, because of the people, for he was a small man.";
B._Luk19_4="And he went quickly in front of them and got up into a tree to see him, for he was going that way.";
B._Luk19_5="And when Jesus came to the place, looking up, he said to him, Zacchaeus, be quick and come down, for I am coming to your house today.";
B._Luk19_6="And he came down quickly, and took him into his house with joy.";
B._Luk19_7="And when they saw it, they were all angry, saying, He has gone into the house of a sinner.";
B._Luk19_8="And Zacchaeus, waiting before him, said to the Lord, See, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone wrongly, I give him back four times as much.";
B._Luk19_9="And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house, for even he is a son of Abraham.";
B._Luk19_10="For the Son of man came to make search for those who are wandering from the way, and to be their Saviour.";
B._Luk19_11="And while they were giving ear to these words, he made another story for them, because he was near Jerusalem, and because they were of the opinion that the kingdom of God was coming straight away.";
B._Luk19_12="So he said, A certain man of high birth went into a far-away country to get a kingdom for himself, and to come back.";
B._Luk19_13="And he sent for ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds and said to them, Do business with this till I come.";
B._Luk19_14="But his people had no love for him, and sent representatives after him, saying, We will not have this man for our ruler.";
B._Luk19_15="And when he came back again, having got his kingdom, he gave orders for those servants to whom he had given the money to come to him, so that he might have an account of what business they had done.";
B._Luk19_16="And the first came before him, saying, Lord, your pound has made ten pounds.";
B._Luk19_17="And he said to him, You have done well, O good servant: because you have done well in a small thing you will have authority over ten towns.";
B._Luk19_18="And another came, saying, Your pound has made five pounds.";
B._Luk19_19="And he said, You will be ruler over five towns.";
B._Luk19_20="And another came, saying, Lord, here is your pound, which I put away in a cloth;";
B._Luk19_21="Because I was in fear of you, for you are a hard man: you take up what you have not put down, and get in grain where you have not put seed.";
B._Luk19_22="He said to him, By the words of your mouth you will be judged, you bad servant. You had knowledge that I am a hard man, taking up what I have not put down and getting in grain where I have not put seed;";
B._Luk19_23="Why then did you not put my money in a bank, so that when I came I would get it back with interest?";
B._Luk19_24="And he said to the others who were near, Take the pound away from him, and give it to the man who has ten.";
B._Luk19_25="And they say to him, Lord, he has ten pounds.";
B._Luk19_26="And I say to you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.";
B._Luk19_27="And as for those who were against me, who would not have me for their ruler, let them come here, and be put to death before me.";
B._Luk19_28="And when he had said this, he went on in front of them, going up to Jerusalem.";
B._Luk19_29="And it came about that when he got near Beth-phage and Bethany by the mountain which is named the Mountain of Olives, he sent two of the disciples,";
B._Luk19_30="Saying, Go into the little town in front of you, and on going in you will see a young ass fixed with a cord, on which no man has ever been seated; let him loose and take him.";
B._Luk19_31="And if anyone says to you, Why are you taking him? say, The Lord has need of him.";
B._Luk19_32="And those whom he sent went away, and it was as he said.";
B._Luk19_33="And when they were getting the young ass, the owners of it said to them, Why are you taking the young ass?";
B._Luk19_34="And they said, The Lord has need of him.";
B._Luk19_35="And they took him to Jesus, and they put their clothing on the ass, and Jesus got on to him.";
B._Luk19_36="And while he went on his way they put their clothing down on the road in front of him.";
B._Luk19_37="And when he came near the foot of the Mountain of Olives, all the disciples with loud voices gave praise to God with joy, because of all the great works which they had seen;";
B._Luk19_38="Saying, A blessing on the King who comes in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven and glory in the highest.";
B._Luk19_39="And some of the Pharisees among the people said to him, Master, make your disciples be quiet.";
B._Luk19_40="And he said in answer, I say to you, if these men keep quiet, the very stones will be crying out.";
B._Luk19_41="And when he got near and saw the town, he was overcome with weeping for it,";
B._Luk19_42="Saying, If you, even you, had knowledge today, of the things which give peace! but you are not able to see them.";
B._Luk19_43="For the time will come when your attackers will put a wall round you, and come all round you and keep you in on every side,";
B._Luk19_44="And will make you level with the earth, and your children with you; and there will not be one stone resting on another in you, because you did not see that it was your day of mercy.";
B._Luk19_45="And he went into the Temple and put out those who were trading there,";
B._Luk19_46="Saying to them, It has been said, My house is to be a house of prayer, but you have made it a hole of thieves.";
B._Luk19_47="And every day he was teaching in the Temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people were attempting to put him to death;";
B._Luk19_48="But they were not able to do anything, because the people all kept near him, being greatly interested in his words.";
B._Luk20_1="And it came about on one of those days, when he was teaching the people in the Temple and preaching the good news,";
B._Luk20_2="That the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people came to him and said, Make clear to us by what authority you do these things and who gave you this authority.";
B._Luk20_3="And in answer he said to them, I will put a question to you, and do you give me an answer:";
B._Luk20_4="The baptism of John, was it from heaven or of men?";
B._Luk20_5="And they said among themselves, If we say, From heaven; he will say, Why did you not have faith in him?";
B._Luk20_6="But if we say, Of men; we will be stoned by the people, for they are certain that John was a prophet.";
B._Luk20_7="And they made answer that they had no idea where it came from.";
B._Luk20_8="And Jesus said, And I will not make clear to you by what authority I do these things.";
B._Luk20_9="And he gave the people this story: A man made a vine-garden and gave the use of it to some field-workers and went into another country for a long time.";
B._Luk20_10="And at the right time he sent a servant to the workers to get part of the fruit from the vines; but the workmen gave him blows and sent him away with nothing.";
B._Luk20_11="And he sent another servant, and they gave blows to him in the same way, and put shame on him, and sent him away with nothing.";
B._Luk20_12="And he sent a third, and they gave him wounds and put him out.";
B._Luk20_13="And the lord of the garden said, What am I to do? I will send my dearly loved son; they may give respect to him.";
B._Luk20_14="But when the workmen saw him, they said to one another, This is he who will one day be the owner of the property: let us put him to death and the heritage will be ours.";
B._Luk20_15="And driving him out of the garden they put him to death. Now what will the lord do to these workmen?";
B._Luk20_16="He will come and put them to destruction and give the garden to others. And when he said this, they said, May it not be so.";
B._Luk20_17="But he, looking on them, said, Is it not in the Writings, The stone which the builders put on one side, the same has become the chief stone of the building?";
B._Luk20_18="Everyone falling on that stone will be broken, but the man on whom the stone comes down will be crushed to dust.";
B._Luk20_19="And the chief priests and the scribes made attempts to get their hands on him in that very hour; and they were in fear of the people, for they saw that he had made up this story against them.";
B._Luk20_20="And they kept watch on him, and sent out secret representatives, who were acting the part of good men, in order that they might get something from his words, on account of which they might give him up to the government and into the power of the ruler.";
B._Luk20_21="And they put a question to him, saying, Master, we are certain that your teaching and your words are right, and that you have no respect for a man's position, but you are teaching the true way of God:";
B._Luk20_22="Is it right for us to make payment of taxes to Caesar or not?";
B._Luk20_23="But he saw through their trick and said to them,";
B._Luk20_24="Let me see a penny. Whose image and name are on it? And they said, Caesar's.";
B._Luk20_25="And he said, Then give to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.";
B._Luk20_26="And they were not able to get anything from these words before the people: but they were full of wonder at his answer, and said nothing.";
B._Luk20_27="And some of the Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no coming back from the dead; and they said to him,";
B._Luk20_28="Master, Moses said that if a man's brother comes to his end, having a wife, but no children, his brother is to take the wife, and get a family for his brother.";
B._Luk20_29="Now there were seven brothers, and the first had a wife and came to his end, having no children;";
B._Luk20_30="And the second;";
B._Luk20_31="And the third took her; and in the same way, all the seven, without having any children, came to their end.";
B._Luk20_32="And last of all, the woman came to her end.";
B._Luk20_33="When they come back from the dead, whose wife will she be? for all the seven had her.";
B._Luk20_34="And Jesus said to them, The sons of this world are married and have wives;";
B._Luk20_35="But those to whom is given the reward of the world to come, and to come back from the dead, have no wives, and are not married;";
B._Luk20_36="And death has no more power over them, for they are equal to the angels, and are sons of God, being of those who will come back from the dead.";
B._Luk20_37="But even Moses made it clear that the dead come back to life, saying, in the story of the burning thorn-tree, The Lord, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.";
B._Luk20_38="Now he is not the God of the dead but of the living: for all men are living to him.";
B._Luk20_39="And some of the scribes, in answer to this, said, Master, you have said well.";
B._Luk20_40="And they had fear of putting any more questions to him.";
B._Luk20_41="And he said to them, Why do they say that the Christ is the son of David?";
B._Luk20_42="For David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Take your seat at my right hand,";
B._Luk20_43="Till I put under your feet all those who are against you.";
B._Luk20_44="David then gives him the name of Lord, so how is it possible for him to be his son?";
B._Luk20_45="And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,";
B._Luk20_46="Keep away from the scribes, whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes, and to have words of respect said to them in the market-places, and to take the chief seats in the Synagogues and the first places at feasts;";

B._Luk21_2="And he saw a certain poor widow putting in a farthing.";
B._Luk21_3="And he said, Truly I say to you, This poor widow has given more than all of them:";
B._Luk21_4="For they gave out of their wealth, having more than enough for themselves: but she, even out of her need, has put in all her living.";
B._Luk21_5="And some were talking about the Temple, how it was made fair with beautiful stones and with offerings, but he said,";
B._Luk21_6="As for these things which you see, the days will come when not one stone will be resting on another, but all will be broken down.";
B._Luk21_7="And they said to him, Master, when will these things be? and what sign will there be when these events are to take place?";
B._Luk21_8="And he said, Take care that you are not tricked: for a number of people will come in my name, saying, I am he; and, The time is near: do not go after them.";
B._Luk21_9="And when news of wars and troubled times comes to your ears, have no fear; for these things have to be, but the end will not be now.";
B._Luk21_10="Then he said to them, Nation will be moved against nation and kingdom against kingdom:";
