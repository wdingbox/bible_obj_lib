B._Mat28_11="Now, while they were going, some of the watchmen came into the town and gave news to the chief priests of all the things which had taken place.";
B._Mat28_12="And when they had come together with those in authority, and had made their decision, they gave much money to the watchmen, saying,";
B._Mat28_13="Say, His disciples came by night and took him away secretly while we were sleeping.";
B._Mat28_14="And if this comes to the ruler's ears, we will see that he does not make you responsible.";
B._Mat28_15="So they took the money, and did as they had been ordered: and this account has been current among the Jews till the present time.";
B._Mat28_16="But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had given them orders to go.";
B._Mat28_17="And when they saw him they gave him worship: but some were in doubt.";
B._Mat28_18="And Jesus came to them and said, All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.";
B._Mat28_19="Go then, and make disciples of all the nations, giving them baptism in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit:";
B._Mat28_20="Teaching them to keep all the rules which I have given you: and see, I am ever with you, even to the end of the world.";
B._Mak1_1="The first words of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.";
B._Mak1_2="Even as it is said in the book of Isaiah the prophet, See, I send my servant before your face, who will make ready your way;";
B._Mak1_3="The voice of one crying in the waste land, Make ready the way of the Lord, make his roads straight;";
B._Mak1_4="John came, and gave baptism in the waste land, preaching baptism as a sign of forgiveness of sin for those whose hearts were changed.";
B._Mak1_5="And there went out to him all the people of Judaea, and all those of Jerusalem, and they were given baptism by him in the river Jordan, saying that they were sinners.";
B._Mak1_6="And John was clothed in camel's hair, with a leather band about him; and his food was locusts and honey.";
B._Mak1_7="And he said to them all, There is one coming after me who is greater than I, whose shoes I am not good enough to undo.";
B._Mak1_8="I have given you baptism with water, but he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit.";
B._Mak1_9="And it came about in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was given baptism by John in the Jordan.";
B._Mak1_10="And straight away, coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens broken open and the Spirit coming down on him as a dove:";
B._Mak1_11="And a voice came out of heaven, You are my dearly loved Son, with whom I am well pleased.";
B._Mak1_12="And straight away the Spirit sent him out into the waste land.";
B._Mak1_13="And he was in the waste land for forty days, being tested by Satan; and he was with the beasts; and the angels took care of him.";
B._Mak1_14="Now after John had been put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the good news of God,";
B._Mak1_15="And saying, The time has come, and the kingdom of God is near: let your hearts be turned from sin and have faith in the good news.";
B._Mak1_16="And going by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew, the brother of Simon, putting a net into the sea: for they were fishermen.";
B._Mak1_17="And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.";
B._Mak1_18="And they went straight from their nets, and came after him.";
B._Mak1_19="And going on a little farther, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were in their boat stitching up their nets.";
B._Mak1_20="And he said, Come after me: and they went away from their father Zebedee, who was in the boat with the servants, and came after him.";
B._Mak1_21="And they came to Capernaum; and on the Sabbath he went into the Synagogue and gave teaching.";
B._Mak1_22="And they were full of wonder at his teaching, because he gave it as one having authority, and not like the scribes.";
B._Mak1_23="And there was in their Synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he gave a cry,";
B._Mak1_24="Saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? have you come to put an end to us? I see well who you are, the Holy One of God.";
B._Mak1_25="And Jesus said to him sharply, Be quiet, and come out of him.";
B._Mak1_26="And the unclean spirit, shaking him violently, and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.";
B._Mak1_27="And they were all greatly surprised, so that they put questions to one another, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he gives orders even to the unclean spirits, and they do what he says.";
B._Mak1_28="And news of him went out quickly everywhere into all parts of Galilee round about.";
B._Mak1_29="And when they came out of the Synagogue, they went into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.";
B._Mak1_30="Now Simon's wife's mother was ill, with a burning heat; and they gave him word of her:";
B._Mak1_31="And he came and took her by the hand, lifting her up; and she became well, and took care of their needs.";
B._Mak1_32="And in the evening, at sundown, they took to him all who were diseased, and those who had evil spirits.";
B._Mak1_33="And all the town had come together at the door.";
B._Mak1_34="And a number, who were ill with different diseases, he made well, and sent out evil spirits; but he did not let the evil spirits say anything, because they had knowledge of him.";
B._Mak1_35="And in the morning, a long time before daylight, he got up and went out to a quiet place, and there he gave himself up to prayer.";
B._Mak1_36="And Simon and those who were with him came after him.";
B._Mak1_37="And when they came up with him, they said to him, Everyone is looking for you.";
B._Mak1_38="And he said to them, Let us go to other parts into the nearest towns, so that I may give teaching there, because for this purpose I came.";
B._Mak1_39="And he went into their Synagogues in every part of Galilee, preaching and driving out evil spirits.";
B._Mak1_40="And a leper came to him and, going down on his knees before him, made a request, saying, If it is your pleasure, you have the power to make me clean.";
B._Mak1_41="And being moved with pity, he put out his hand, and touching him said to him, It is my pleasure; be made clean.";
B._Mak1_42="And straight away the disease went from him, and he was made clean.";
B._Mak1_43="And he sent him away, saying to him very sharply,";
B._Mak1_44="See that you say nothing to any man: but go and let the priest see you, and make yourself clean by an offering of the things ordered by Moses, for a witness to them.";
B._Mak1_45="But he went out, and made it public, giving an account of it everywhere, so that Jesus was no longer able to go openly into a town, but was outside in the waste land; and they came to him from every part.";
B._Mak2_1="And when he came into Capernaum again after some days, the news went about that he was in the house.";
B._Mak2_2="And a great number had come together, so that there was no longer room for them, no, not even about the door: and he gave them teaching.";
B._Mak2_3="And four men came to him with one on a bed who had no power of moving.";
B._Mak2_4="And when they were unable to get near him because of all the people, they got the roof uncovered where he was: and when it was broken up, they let down the bed on which the man was.";
B._Mak2_5="And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to him, Son, you have forgiveness for your sins.";
B._Mak2_6="But there were certain of the scribes seated there, and reasoning in their hearts,";
B._Mak2_7="Why does this man say such things? he has no respect for God: from whom does forgiveness come but from God only?";
B._Mak2_8="And Jesus, having knowledge in his spirit of their thoughts, said to them, Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?";
B._Mak2_9="Which is the simpler, to say to a man who is ill, You have forgiveness for your sins, or, Get up, take up your bed, and go?";
B._Mak2_10="But so that you may see that the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins on earth, (he said to the man,)";
B._Mak2_11="I say to you, Get up, take up your bed, and go to your house.";
B._Mak2_12="And he got up, and straight away took up the bed and went out before them all, so that they were all full of wonder, and gave glory to God, saying, We have never seen anything like this.";
B._Mak2_13="And he went out again by the seaside; and all the people came to him, and he gave them teaching.";
B._Mak2_14="And when he went by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, seated at the place where taxes were taken, and he said to him, Come with me. And he got up, and went with him.";
B._Mak2_15="And it came about that he was seated at meat in his house, and a number of tax-farmers and sinners were at table with Jesus and his disciples: for there were a great number of them, and they came after him.";
B._Mak2_16="And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was taking food with the tax-farmers and sinners, said to his disciples, Why does he take food and drink with such men?";
B._Mak2_17="And Jesus, hearing it, said to them, Those who are well have no need of a medical man, but those who are ill: I have come not to get the upright but sinners.";
B._Mak2_18="And John's disciples and the Pharisees were taking no food: and they came and said to him, Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees go without food, but your disciples do not?";
B._Mak2_19="And Jesus said to them, Will the friends of a newly-married man go without food while he is with them? as long as they have him with them they will not go without food.";
B._Mak2_20="But the days will come when the husband will be taken away from them, and then they will go without food.";
B._Mak2_21="No man puts a bit of new cloth on an old coat: or the new, by pulling away from the old, makes a worse hole.";
B._Mak2_22="And no man puts new wine into old wine-skins: or the skins will be burst by the wine, and the wine and the skins will be wasted: but new wine has to be put into new wine-skins.";
B._Mak2_23="And it came about that on the Sabbath day he was going through the grain-fields; and while they were walking, his disciples took the heads of grain.";
B._Mak2_24="And the Pharisees said to him, Why are they doing what it is not right to do on the Sabbath?";
B._Mak2_25="And he said to them, Have you no knowledge of what David did, when he had need and was without food, he, and those who were with him?";
B._Mak2_26="How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and took for food the holy bread, which only the priests may take, and gave it to those who were with him?";
B._Mak2_27="And he said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath;";
B._Mak2_28="So that the Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath.";
B._Mak3_1="And he went again into the Synagogue; and there was a man there whose hand was dead.";
B._Mak3_2="And they were watching him to see if he would make him well on the Sabbath day, so that they might have something against him.";
B._Mak3_3="And he said to the man, Get up and come forward.";
B._Mak3_4="And he said to them, Is it right to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil? to give life or to put to death? But they said nothing.";
B._Mak3_5="And looking round on them he was angry, being sad because of their hard hearts; and he said to the man, Put out your hand. And he put it out, and his hand was made well.";
B._Mak3_6="And the Pharisees went out, and straight away made designs with the Herodians about how they might put him to death.";
B._Mak3_7="And Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, and a great number from Galilee came after him: and from Judaea,";
B._Mak3_8="And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and the other side of Jordan, and the country about Tyre and Sidon, a great number, hearing what great things he did, came to him.";
B._Mak3_9="And he made a request to his disciples to have a little boat ready for him, so that he might not be crushed by the people;";
B._Mak3_10="For he had made such a great number well that all those who were diseased were falling down before him for the purpose of touching him.";
B._Mak3_11="And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, went down before him, crying out, and saying, You are the Son of God.";
B._Mak3_12="And he gave them special orders not to say who he was.";
B._Mak3_13="And he went up into the mountain, and sent for those whom it was his pleasure to have with him: and they went to him.";
B._Mak3_14="And he took twelve to be with him, so that he might send them out as preachers,";
B._Mak3_15="And give them the power of driving out evil spirits:";
B._Mak3_16="To Simon he gave the second name of Peter;";
B._Mak3_17="And to James, the son of Zebedee, and John, the brother of James, he gave the second name of Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:";
B._Mak3_18="And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot;";
B._Mak3_19="And Judas Iscariot, who was false to him.";
B._Mak3_20="And he went into a house. And the people came together again, so that they were not even able to take bread.";
B._Mak3_21="And when his friends had news of it, they went out to get him, saying, He is off his head.";
B._Mak3_22="And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem, said, He has Beelzebub, and, By the ruler of evil spirits he sends evil spirits out of men.";
B._Mak3_23="And turning to them, he said to them in the form of a story, How is it possible for Satan to put out Satan?";
B._Mak3_24="If there is division in a kingdom, that kingdom will come to destruction;";
B._Mak3_25="And if there is division in a house, that house will come to destruction;";
B._Mak3_26="And if Satan is at war with himself, and there is division in him, he will not keep his place but will come to an end.";
B._Mak3_27="But no one is able to go into the house of the strong man and take his goods, without first putting cords round the strong man, and then he will take his goods.";
B._Mak3_28="Truly, I say to you, The sons of men will have forgiveness for all their sins and for all the evil words they say:";
B._Mak3_29="But whoever says evil things against the Holy Spirit will never have forgiveness, but the evil he has done will be with him for ever:";
B._Mak3_30="Because they said, He has an unclean spirit.";
B._Mak3_31="And his mother and brothers came and were outside, and sent for him, requesting to see him.";
B._Mak3_32="And a great number were seated round him; and they said to him, See, your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you.";
B._Mak3_33="And he said in answer, Who are my mother and my brothers?";
B._Mak3_34="And looking round at those who were seated about him, he said, See, my mother and my brothers!";
B._Mak3_35="Whoever does God's pleasure, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.";
B._Mak4_1="And again he was teaching by the seaside. And a very great number of people had come to him, so that he got into a boat on the sea and took his seat; and all the people were on the land by the seaside.";
B._Mak4_2="And he gave them teaching about a number of things in the form of stories, and said to them in his teaching, Give ear:";
B._Mak4_3="A man went out to put seed in the earth:";
B._Mak4_4="And while he was doing it, some was dropped by the wayside, and the birds came and took it for food.";
B._Mak4_5="And some went on the stones, where it had not much earth; and it came up straight away, because the earth was not deep:";
B._Mak4_6="And when the sun was high, it was burned; and because it had no root, it became dry and dead.";
B._Mak4_7="And some went among the thorns, and the thorns came up, and it had no room for growth and gave no fruit.";
B._Mak4_8="And some, falling on good earth, gave fruit, coming up and increasing, and giving thirty, sixty, and a hundred times as much.";
B._Mak4_9="And he said to them, Whoever has ears, let him give ear.";
B._Mak4_10="And when he was by himself, those who were round him with the twelve put questions to him about the purpose of the stories.";
B._Mak4_11="And he said to them, To you is given the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things are given in the form of stories;";
B._Mak4_12="So that seeing they may see, and it will not be clear to them; and hearing it, they will not get the sense; for fear that they may be turned again to me and have forgiveness.";
B._Mak4_13="And he said to them, If you are not clear about this story, how will you be clear about the others?";
B._Mak4_14="The seed is the word.";
B._Mak4_15="And these are they by the wayside, where the word is planted; and when they have given ear, the Evil One comes straight away and takes away the word which has been planted in them.";
B._Mak4_16="And in the same way, these are they who are planted on the stones, who, when the word has come to their ears, straight away take it with joy;";
B._Mak4_17="And they have no root in themselves, but go on for a time; then, when trouble comes or pain, because of the word, they quickly become full of doubts.";
B._Mak4_18="And others are those planted among the thorns; these are they who have given ear to the word,";
B._Mak4_19="And the cares of this life, and the deceits of wealth, and the desire for other things coming in, put a stop to the growth of the word, and it gives no fruit.";
B._Mak4_20="And these are they who were planted on the good earth; such as give ear to the word, and take it into their hearts, and give fruit, thirty and sixty and a hundred times as much.";
B._Mak4_21="And he said to them, When the light comes in, do people put it under a vessel, or under the bed, and not on its table?";
B._Mak4_22="There is nothing covered which will not be seen openly, and nothing has been made secret which will not come to light.";
B._Mak4_23="If any man has ears, let him give ear.";
B._Mak4_24="And he said to them, Take care what you give ear to: in the same measure as you give you will get, and more will be given to you.";
B._Mak4_25="He who has, to him will be given: and he who has not, from him will be taken even that which he has.";
B._Mak4_26="And he said, Such is the kingdom of God, as if a man put seed in the earth,";
B._Mak4_27="And went to sleep and got up, night and day, and the seed came to growth, though he had no idea how.";
B._Mak4_28="The earth gives fruit by herself; first the leaf, then the head, then the full grain.";
B._Mak4_29="But when the grain is ready, he quickly sends men to get it cut, because the time for cutting has come.";
B._Mak4_30="And he said, What picture may we give of the kingdom of God, or with what story may we make it clear?";
B._Mak4_31="It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is put in the earth, is smaller than all the seeds on the earth,";
B._Mak4_32="But when it is planted, it comes up, and becomes taller than all the plants, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of heaven are able to take rest in its shade.";
B._Mak4_33="And with a number of such stories he gave them his teaching, as they were able to take it:";
B._Mak4_34="And without a story he said nothing to them: but privately to his disciples he made all things clear.";
B._Mak4_35="And on that day, when the evening had come, he said to them, Let us go over to the other side.";
B._Mak4_36="And going away from the people, they took him with them, as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.";
B._Mak4_37="And a great storm of wind came up, and the waves came into the boat, so that the boat was now becoming full.";
B._Mak4_38="And he himself was in the back of the boat, sleeping on the cushion: and they, awaking him, said, Master, is it nothing to you that we are in danger of destruction?";
B._Mak4_39="And he came out of his sleep, and gave strong orders to the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be at rest. And the wind went down, and there was a great calm.";
B._Mak4_40="And he said to them, Why are you full of fear? have you still no faith?";
B._Mak4_41="And their fear was great, and they said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea do his orders?";
B._Mak5_1="And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes.";
B._Mak5_2="And when he had got out of the boat, straight away there came to him from the place of the dead a man with an unclean spirit.";
B._Mak5_3="He was living in the place of the dead: and no man was able to keep him down, no, not with a chain;";
B._Mak5_4="Because he had frequently been prisoned in chains and iron bands, and the chains had been parted and the bands broken by him: and no man was strong enough to make him quiet.";
B._Mak5_5="And all the time, by day and by night, in the place of the dead, and in the mountains, he was crying out and cutting himself with stones.";
B._Mak5_6="And when he saw Jesus from far off, he went quickly to him and gave him worship;";
B._Mak5_7="And crying out with a loud voice he said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God's name, do not be cruel to me.";
B._Mak5_8="For Jesus had said to him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit.";
B._Mak5_9="And Jesus said, What is your name? And he made answer, My name is Legion, because there are a great number of us.";
B._Mak5_10="And he made strong prayers to him not to send them away out of the country.";
B._Mak5_11="Now on the mountain side there was a great herd of pigs getting their food.";
B._Mak5_12="And they said to him, Send us into the pigs, so that we may go into them.";
B._Mak5_13="And he let them do it. And the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs; and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea, about two thousand of them; and they came to their death in the sea.";
B._Mak5_14="And their keepers went running and gave an account of it in the town and in the country. And people came to see what had taken place.";
B._Mak5_15="And they came to Jesus, and saw the man in whom had been the evil spirits seated, clothed and with full use of his senses, and they were full of fear.";
B._Mak5_16="And those who had seen it gave them an account of what had been done to him who had the evil spirits, and of the fate of the pigs.";
B._Mak5_17="And they made a request to him to go out of their country.";
B._Mak5_18="And when he was getting into the boat, the man in whom had been the evil spirits had a great desire to come with him.";
B._Mak5_19="And he would not let him, but said to him, Go to your house, to your friends, and give them news of the great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you.";
B._Mak5_20="And he went on his way, and made public in the country of Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him: and all men were full of wonder.";
B._Mak5_21="And when Jesus had gone over again in the boat to the other side, a great number of people came to him: and he was by the sea.";
B._Mak5_22="And one of the rulers of the Synagogue, Jairus by name, came, and seeing him, went down at his feet,";
B._Mak5_23="And made strong prayers to him, saying, My little daughter is near to death: it is my prayer that you will come and put your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and have life.";
B._Mak5_24="And he went with him; and a great number of people went after him, and came round him.";
B._Mak5_25="And a woman, who had had a flow of blood for twelve years,";
B._Mak5_26="And had undergone much at the hands of a number of medical men, and had given all she had, and was no better, but even worse,";
B._Mak5_27="When she had news of the things which Jesus did, went among the people coming after him, and put her hand on his robe.";
B._Mak5_28="For she said, If I may only put my hand on his robe, I will be made well.";
B._Mak5_29="And straight away the fountain of her blood was stopped, and she had a feeling in her body that her disease had gone and she was well.";
B._Mak5_30="And straight away Jesus was conscious that power had gone out of him; and, turning to the people, he said, Who was touching my robe?";
B._Mak5_31="And his disciples said to him, You see the people round you on every side, and you say, Who was touching me?";
B._Mak5_32="And on his looking round to see her who had done this thing,";
B._Mak5_33="The woman, shaking with fear, conscious of what had been done to her, came and, falling on her face before him, gave him a true account of everything.";
B._Mak5_34="And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be free from your disease.";
B._Mak5_35="And while he was still talking, they came from the ruler of the Synagogue's house, saying, Your daughter is dead: why are you still troubling the Master?";
B._Mak5_36="But Jesus, giving no attention to their words, said to the ruler of the Synagogue, Have no fear, only have faith.";
B._Mak5_37="And he did not let anyone come with him, but Peter and James and John, the brother of James.";
B._Mak5_38="And they came to the house of the ruler of the Synagogue; and he saw people running this way and that, and weeping and crying loudly.";
B._Mak5_39="And when he had gone in, he said to them, Why are you making such a noise and weeping? The child is not dead, but sleeping.";
