B._Mat24_51="And will have him cut in two, and will give him a part in the fate of the false ones: there will be weeping and cries of sorrow.";
B._Mat25_1="Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins, the friends of the bride, who took their lights, and went out with the purpose of meeting the husband.";
B._Mat25_2="And five of them were foolish, and five were wise.";
B._Mat25_3="For the foolish, when they took their lights, took no oil with them.";
B._Mat25_4="But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lights.";
B._Mat25_5="Now the husband was a long time in coming, and they all went to sleep.";
B._Mat25_6="But in the middle of the night there is a cry, The husband comes! Go out to him.";
B._Mat25_7="Then all those virgins got up, and made ready their lights.";
B._Mat25_8="And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lights are going out.";
B._Mat25_9="But the wise made answer, saying, There may not be enough for us and you; it would be better for you to go to the traders and get oil for yourselves.";
B._Mat25_10="And while they went to get oil, the master came; and those who were ready went in with him to the feast: and the door was shut.";
B._Mat25_11="After that the other virgins came, saying, Lord, Lord, let us in.";
B._Mat25_12="But he made answer and said, Truly I say to you, I have no knowledge of you.";
B._Mat25_13="Keep watch, then, because you are not certain of the day or of the hour.";
B._Mat25_14="For it is as when a man, about to take a journey, got his servants together, and gave them his property.";
B._Mat25_15="And to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to everyone as he was able; and he went on his journey.";
B._Mat25_16="Straight away he who had been given the five talents went and did trade with them, and made five more.";
B._Mat25_17="In the same way he who had been given the two got two more.";
B._Mat25_18="But he who was given the one went away and put it in a hole in the earth, and kept his lord's money in a secret place.";
B._Mat25_19="Now after a long time the lord of those servants comes, and makes up his account with them.";
B._Mat25_20="And he who had the five talents came with his other five talents, saying, Lord, you gave into my care five talents: see, I have got five more.";
B._Mat25_21="His lord said to him, Well done, good and true servant: you have been true in a small thing, I will give you control over great things: take your part in the joy of your lord.";
B._Mat25_22="And he who had the two talents came and said, Lord, you gave into my care two talents: see, I have got two more.";
B._Mat25_23="His lord said to him, Well done, good and true servant: you have been true in a small thing, I will give you control over great things: take your part in the joy of your lord.";
B._Mat25_24="And he who had had the one talent came and said, Lord, I had knowledge that you are a hard man, getting in grain where you have not put seed, and making profits for which you have done no work:";
B._Mat25_25="And I was in fear, and went away, and put your talent in the earth: here is what is yours.";
B._Mat25_26="But his lord in answer said to him, You are a bad and unready servant; if you had knowledge that I get in grain where I did not put seed, and make profits for which I have done no work,";
B._Mat25_27="Why, then, did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I would have got back what is mine with interest?";
B._Mat25_28="Take away, then, his talent and give it to him who has the ten talents.";
B._Mat25_29="For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have more: but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.";
B._Mat25_30="And put out the servant who is of no profit into the outer dark: there will be weeping and cries of sorrow.";
B._Mat25_31="But when the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then will he be seated in his glory:";
B._Mat25_32="And before him all the nations will come together; and they will be parted one from another, as the sheep are parted from the goats by the keeper.";
B._Mat25_33="And he will put the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left.";
B._Mat25_34="Then will the King say to those on his right, Come, you who have the blessing of my Father, into the kingdom made ready for you before the world was:";
B._Mat25_35="For I was in need of food, and you gave it to me: I was in need of drink, and you gave it to me: I was wandering, and you took me in;";
B._Mat25_36="I had no clothing, and you gave it to me: when I was ill, or in prison, you came to me.";
B._Mat25_37="Then will the upright make answer to him, saying, Lord, when did we see you in need of food, and give it to you? or in need of drink, and give it to you?";
B._Mat25_38="And when did we see you wandering, and take you in? or without clothing, and give it to you?";
B._Mat25_39="And when did we see you ill, or in prison, and come to you?";
B._Mat25_40="And the King will make answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Because you did it to the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.";
B._Mat25_41="Then will he say to those on the left, Go from me, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire which is ready for the Evil One and his angels:";
B._Mat25_42="For I was in need of food, and you gave it not to me; I was in need of drink, and you gave it not to me:";
B._Mat25_43="I was wandering, and you took me not in; without clothing, and you gave me no clothing; ill, and in prison, and you came not to me.";
B._Mat25_44="Then will they make answer, saying, Lord, when did we see you in need of food or drink, or wandering, or without clothing, or ill, or in prison, and did not take care of you?";
B._Mat25_45="Then will he make answer to them, saying, Truly I say to you, Because you did it not to the least of these, you did it not to me.";
B._Mat25_46="And these will go away into eternal punishment; but the upright into eternal life.";
B._Mat26_1="And when Jesus had come to the end of all these words, he said to his disciples,";
B._Mat26_2="After two days is the Passover, and the Son of man will be given up to the death of the cross.";
B._Mat26_3="Then the chief priests and the rulers of the people came together in the house of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas.";
B._Mat26_4="And they made designs together to take Jesus by some trick, and put him to death.";
B._Mat26_5="But they said, Not while the feast is going on, for fear of trouble among the people.";
B._Mat26_6="Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,";
B._Mat26_7="There came to him a woman having a bottle of perfume of great price, and she put the perfume on his head when he was seated at table.";
B._Mat26_8="But when the disciples saw it they were angry, saying, To what purpose is this waste?";
B._Mat26_9="For we might have got much money for this and given it to the poor.";
B._Mat26_10="But Jesus, seeing it, said to them, Why are you troubling the woman? she has done a kind act to me.";
B._Mat26_11="For the poor you have ever with you, but me you have not for ever.";
B._Mat26_12="For in putting this perfume on my body, she did it to make me ready for my last resting-place.";
B._Mat26_13="Truly I say to you, Wherever this good news goes out in all the world, what this woman has done will be talked of in memory of her.";
B._Mat26_14="Then one of the twelve, who was named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said,";
B._Mat26_15="What will you give me, if I give him up to you? And the price was fixed at thirty bits of silver.";
B._Mat26_16="And from that time he was watching for a chance to give him into their hands.";
B._Mat26_17="Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where are we to make ready for you to take the Passover meal?";
B._Mat26_18="And he said to them, Go into the town to such a man, and say to him, The Master says, My time is near: I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.";
B._Mat26_19="And the disciples did as Jesus had said to them; and they made ready the Passover.";
B._Mat26_20="Now when evening was come, he was seated at table with the twelve disciples;";
B._Mat26_21="And while they were taking food, he said, Truly I say to you that one of you will be false to me.";
B._Mat26_22="And they were very said, and said to him, one by one, Is it I, Lord?";
B._Mat26_23="And he made answer and said, He who puts his hand into the plate with me, the same will be false to me.";
B._Mat26_24="The Son of man goes, even as the Writings say of him: but a curse is on that man through whom the Son of man is given up; it would have been well for that man if he had never come into the world.";
B._Mat26_25="And Judas, who was false to him, made answer and said, Is it I, Master? He says to him, Yes.";
B._Mat26_26="And when they were taking food, Jesus took bread and, after blessing it, he gave the broken bread to the disciples and said, Take it; this is my body.";
B._Mat26_27="And he took a cup and, having given praise, he gave it to them, saying,";
B._Mat26_28="Take of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the testament, which is given for men for the forgiveness of sins.";
B._Mat26_29="But I say to you that from now I will not take of this fruit of the vine, till that day when I take it new with you in my Father's kingdom.";
B._Mat26_30="And after a song of praise to God, they went out to the Mountain of Olives.";
B._Mat26_31="Then said Jesus to them, All of you will be turned away from me this night: for it is said in the Writings, I will put to death the keeper of the sheep, and the sheep of the flock will be put to flight.";
B._Mat26_32="But after I am come back from the dead, I will go before you into Galilee.";
B._Mat26_33="But Peter made answer and said to him, Though all may be turned away from you, I will never be turned away.";
B._Mat26_34="Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that this night, before the hour of the cock's cry, you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me.";
B._Mat26_35="Peter says to him, Even if I am put to death with you, I will not be false to you. So said all the disciples.";
B._Mat26_36="Then comes Jesus with them to a place named Gethsemane, and says to his disciples, Be seated here, while I go over there for prayer.";
B._Mat26_37="And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and became sad and very troubled.";
B._Mat26_38="Then says he to them, My soul is very sad, even to death: keep watch with me here.";
B._Mat26_39="And he went forward a little, and falling down on his face in prayer, he said, O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup go from me; but let not my pleasure, but yours be done.";
B._Mat26_40="And he comes to the disciples, and sees that they are sleeping, and says to Peter, What, were you not able to keep watch with me one hour?";
B._Mat26_41="Keep watch with prayer, so that you may not be put to the test: the spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is feeble.";
B._Mat26_42="Again, a second time he went away, and said in prayer, O my Father, if this may not go from me without my taking it, let your pleasure be done.";
B._Mat26_43="And he came again and saw them sleeping, for their eyes were tired.";
B._Mat26_44="And he went away from them again, and a third time said the same prayer.";
B._Mat26_45="Then he comes to the disciples; and says to them, Go on sleeping now, and take your rest: for the hour is come, and the Son of man is given into the hands of evil men.";
B._Mat26_46="Up, let us be going: see, he who gives me up is near.";
B._Mat26_47="And while he was still talking, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a band armed with swords and sticks, from the chief priests and those in authority over the people.";
B._Mat26_48="Now the false one had given them a sign saying, The one to whom I give a kiss, that is he: take him.";
B._Mat26_49="And straight away he came to Jesus and said, Master! and gave him a kiss.";
B._Mat26_50="And Jesus said to him, Friend, do that for which you have come. Then they came and put hands on Jesus, and took him.";
B._Mat26_51="And one of those who were with Jesus put out his hand, and took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow, cutting off his ear.";
B._Mat26_52="Then says Jesus to him, Put up your sword again into its place: for all those who take the sword will come to death by the sword.";
B._Mat26_53="Does it not seem possible to you that if I make request to my Father he will even now send me an army of angels?";
B._Mat26_54="But how then would the Writings come true, which say that so it has to be?";
B._Mat26_55="In that hour Jesus said to the people, Have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me? I was teaching every day in the Temple and you took me not.";
B._Mat26_56="But all this has taken place so that the writings of the prophets might come true. Then all his disciples went from him in flight.";
B._Mat26_57="And those who had made Jesus prisoner took him away to the house of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and those in authority over the people had come together.";
B._Mat26_58="But Peter went after him at a distance, to the house of the high priest, and went in and took his seat with the servants, to see the end.";
B._Mat26_59="Now the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death;";
B._Mat26_60="And they were not able to get it, though a number of false witnesses came.";
B._Mat26_61="But later there came two who said, This man said, I am able to give the Temple of God to destruction, and to put it up again in three days.";
B._Mat26_62="And the high priest got up and said to him, Have you no answer? what is it which these say against you?";
B._Mat26_63="But Jesus said not a word. And the high priest said to him, I put you on oath, by the living God, that you will say to us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.";
B._Mat26_64="Jesus says to him, You say so: but I say to you, From now you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.";
B._Mat26_65="Then the high priest, violently parting his robes, said, He has said evil against God: what more need have we of witnesses? for now his words against God have come to your ears:";
B._Mat26_66="What is your opinion? They made answer and said, It is right for him to be put to death.";
B._Mat26_67="Then they put shame on him, and were cruel to him: and some gave him blows, saying,";
B._Mat26_68="Be a prophet, O Christ, and say who gave you a blow!";
B._Mat26_69="Now Peter was seated in the open square outside the house: and a servant-girl came to him, saying, You were with Jesus the Galilaean.";
B._Mat26_70="But he said before them all that it was false, saying, I have no knowledge of what you say.";
B._Mat26_71="And when he had gone out into the doorway, another saw him and says to those who were there, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.";
B._Mat26_72="And again he said with an oath, I have no knowledge of the man.";
B._Mat26_73="And after a little time those who were near came and said to Peter, Truly you are one of them; because your talk is witness against you.";
B._Mat26_74="Then with curses and oaths he said, I have no knowledge of the man. And straight away there came the cry of a cock.";
B._Mat26_75="And the word of Jesus came back to Peter, when he said, Before the hour of the cock's cry, you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me. And he went out, weeping bitterly.";
B._Mat27_1="Now when it was morning, all the chief priests and those in authority took thought together with the purpose of putting Jesus to death.";
B._Mat27_2="And they put cords on him and took him away, and gave him up to Pilate, the ruler.";
B._Mat27_3="Then Judas, who was false to him, seeing that he was to be put to death, in his regret took back the thirty bits of silver to the chief priests and those in authority,";
B._Mat27_4="Saying, I have done wrong in giving into your hands an upright man. But they said, What is that to us? it is your business.";
B._Mat27_5="And he put down the silver in the Temple and went out, and put himself to death by hanging.";
B._Mat27_6="And the chief priests took the silver and said, It is not right to put it in the Temple store for it is the price of blood.";
B._Mat27_7="And they made a decision to get with the silver the potter's field, as a place for the dead of other countries.";
B._Mat27_8="For this cause that field was named, The field of blood, to this day.";
B._Mat27_9="Then came true that which was said by Jeremiah the prophet, And they took the thirty bits of silver, the price of him who was valued by the children of Israel;";
B._Mat27_10="And they gave them for the potter's field, as I had word from the Lord.";
B._Mat27_11="And Jesus was before the ruler, who put a question to him, Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, You say so.";
B._Mat27_12="But when the chief priests and those in authority made statements against him, he gave no answer.";
B._Mat27_13="Then says Pilate to him, Do you give no attention to what their witnesses say against you?";
B._Mat27_14="And he gave him no answer, not even a word: so that the ruler was greatly surprised.";
B._Mat27_15="Now at the feast it was the way for the ruler to let free to the people one prisoner, at their selection.";
B._Mat27_16="And they had then an important prisoner, whose name was Barabbas.";
B._Mat27_17="So when they came together, Pilate said to them, Whom will you have? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is named Christ?";
B._Mat27_18="For he saw that for envy they had given him up.";
B._Mat27_19="And while he was on the judge's seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that upright man, for I have had much trouble this day in a dream because of him.";
B._Mat27_20="Now the chief priests and those in authority got the people to make request for Barabbas, and for Jesus to be put to death.";
B._Mat27_21="But the ruler made answer and said to them, Which of the two is it your pleasure that I let go free? And they said, Barabbas.";
B._Mat27_22="Pilate says to them, What, then, am I to do with Jesus, who is named Christ? They all say, Let him be put to death on the cross.";
B._Mat27_23="And he said, Why, what evil has he done? But they gave loud cries, saying, To the cross with him!";
B._Mat27_24="So when Pilate saw that he was able to do nothing, but that trouble was working up, he took water and, washing his hands before the people, said, The blood of this upright man is not on my hands: you are responsible.";
B._Mat27_25="And all the people made answer and said, Let his blood be on us, and on our children.";
B._Mat27_26="Then he let Barabbas go free: but after having Jesus whipped, he gave him up to be put to death on the cross.";
B._Mat27_27="Then the ruler's armed men took Jesus into the open square, and got all their band together.";
B._Mat27_28="And they took off his clothing, and put on him a red robe.";
B._Mat27_29="And they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and put a rod in his right hand, and they went down on their knees before him, and made sport of him, saying, Long life to the King of the Jews.";
B._Mat27_30="And they put shame on him, and gave him blows on the head with the rod.";
B._Mat27_31="And when they had made sport of him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothing on him, and took him away to put him on the cross.";
B._Mat27_32="And while they were coming out, they saw a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they made him go with them, so that he might take up his cross.";
B._Mat27_33="And when they came to the place named Golgotha, that is to say, Dead Man's Head,";
B._Mat27_34="They gave him wine mixed with bitter drink: and after tasting it, he took no more.";
B._Mat27_35="And when they had put him on the cross, they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance.";
B._Mat27_36="And they were seated there watching him.";
B._Mat27_37="And they put up over his head the statement of his crime in writing, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.";
B._Mat27_38="Then two thieves were put on crosses with him, one on the right and one on the left.";
B._Mat27_39="And those who went by said bitter words to him, shaking their heads and saying,";
B._Mat27_40="You who would give the Temple to destruction and put it up again in three days, get yourself free: if you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.";
B._Mat27_41="In the same way, the chief priests, making sport of him, with the scribes and those in authority, said,";
B._Mat27_42="A saviour of others, he has no salvation for himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will have faith in him.";
B._Mat27_43="He put his faith in God; let God be his saviour now, if he will have him; for he said, I am the Son of God.";
B._Mat27_44="And the thieves who were on the crosses said evil words to him.";
B._Mat27_45="Now from the sixth hour it was dark over all the land till the ninth hour.";
B._Mat27_46="And about the ninth hour Jesus gave a loud cry, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why are you turned away from me?";
B._Mat27_47="And some of those who were near by, hearing it, said, This man is crying to Elijah.";
B._Mat27_48="And straight away one of them went quickly, and took a sponge, and made it full of bitter wine, and put it on a rod and gave him drink.";
B._Mat27_49="And the rest said, Let him be; let us see if Elijah will come to his help.";
B._Mat27_50="And Jesus gave another loud cry, and gave up his spirit.";
B._Mat27_51="And the curtain of the Temple was parted in two from end to end; and there was an earth-shock; and the rocks were broken;";
B._Mat27_52="And the resting-places of the dead came open; and the bodies of a number of sleeping saints came to life;";
B._Mat27_53="And coming out of their resting-places, after he had come again from the dead, they went into the holy town and were seen by a number of people.";
B._Mat27_54="Now the captain and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earth-shock and the things which were done, were in great fear and said, Truly this was a son of God.";
B._Mat27_55="And a number of women were there, watching from a distance, who had come with Jesus from Galilee, waiting on his needs.";
B._Mat27_56="Among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.";
B._Mat27_57="And in the evening, there came a man of wealth from Arimathaea, Joseph by name, who was a disciple of Jesus:";
B._Mat27_58="This man went in to Pilate, and made a request for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate gave orders for it to be given to him.";
B._Mat27_59="And Joseph took the body, folding it in clean linen,";
B._Mat27_60="And put it in the resting-place which had been cut out of the rock for himself; and after rolling a great stone to the door of it he went away.";
B._Mat27_61="And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, seated by the place of the dead.";
B._Mat27_62="Now on the day after the getting ready of the Passover, the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate,";
B._Mat27_63="Saying, Sir, we have in mind how that false man said, while he was still living, After three days I will come again from the dead.";
B._Mat27_64="Give orders, then, that the place where his body is may be made safe till the third day, for fear that his disciples come and take him away secretly and say to the people, He has come back from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first.";
B._Mat27_65="Pilate said to them, You have watchmen; go and make it as safe as you are able.";
B._Mat27_66="So they went, and made safe the place where his body was, putting a stamp on the stone, and the watchmen were with them.";
B._Mat28_1="Now late on the Sabbath, when the dawn of the first day of the week was near, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the place where his body was.";
B._Mat28_2="And there was a great earth-shock; for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, rolling back the stone, took his seat on it.";
B._Mat28_3="His form was shining like the light, and his clothing was white as snow:";
B._Mat28_4="And for fear of him the watchmen were shaking, and became as dead men.";
B._Mat28_5="And the angel said to the women, Have no fear: for I see that you are searching for Jesus, who was put to death on the cross.";
B._Mat28_6="He is not here, for he has come to life again, even as he said. Come, see the Lord's resting-place.";
B._Mat28_7="And go quickly and give his disciples the news that he has come back from the dead, and is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him, as I have said to you.";
B._Mat28_8="And they went away quickly, with fear and great joy, to give his disciples the news.";
B._Mat28_9="And on the way, Jesus came to them, saying, Be glad. And they came and put their hands on his feet, and gave him worship.";
B._Mat28_10="Then said Jesus to them, Have no fear: go and give word to my brothers to go into Galilee, and there they will see me.";
