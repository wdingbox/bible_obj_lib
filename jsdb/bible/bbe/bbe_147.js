B._Mak10_5="But Jesus said to them, Because of your hard hearts he gave you this law.";
B._Mak10_6="But from the first, male and female made he them.";
B._Mak10_7="For this cause will a man go away from his father and mother, and be joined to his wife;";
B._Mak10_8="And the two will become one flesh; so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.";
B._Mak10_9="Let not that which has been joined together by God be parted by man.";
B._Mak10_10="And in the house the disciples put questions to him again about this thing.";
B._Mak10_11="And he said to them, Whoever puts away his wife and takes another, is false to his wife;";
B._Mak10_12="And if she herself puts away her husband and takes another, she is false to her husband.";
B._Mak10_13="And they took to him little children, so that he might put his hands on them: and the disciples said sharp words to them.";
B._Mak10_14="And when Jesus saw it, he was angry, and said to them, Let the little children come to me, and do not keep them away; for of such is the kingdom of God.";
B._Mak10_15="Truly I say to you, Whoever does not put himself under the kingdom of God like a little child, will not come into it at all.";
B._Mak10_16="And he took them in his arms, and gave them a blessing, putting his hands on them.";
B._Mak10_17="And while he was going out into the way, a man came running to him, and went down on his knees, saying, Good Master, what have I to do so that I may have eternal life?";
B._Mak10_18="And Jesus said to him, Why do you say I am good? no one is good but one, and that is God.";
B._Mak10_19="You have knowledge of what is said in the law, Do not put any one to death, Do not be untrue in married life, Do not take what is not yours, Do not give false witness, Do not get money by deceit, Give honour to your father and mother.";
B._Mak10_20="And he said to him, Master, all these laws I have kept from the time when I was young.";
B._Mak10_21="And Jesus, looking on him and loving him, said, There is one thing needed: go, get money for your goods, and give it to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven: and come with me.";
B._Mak10_22="But his face became sad at the saying, and he went away sorrowing: for he was one who had much property.";
B._Mak10_23="And Jesus, looking round about, said to his disciples, How hard it is for those who have wealth to come into the kingdom of God!";
B._Mak10_24="And the disciples were full of wonder at his words. But Jesus said to them again, Children, how hard it is for those who put faith in wealth to come into the kingdom of God!";
B._Mak10_25="It is simpler for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a man of wealth to come into the kingdom of God.";
B._Mak10_26="And they were greatly surprised, saying to him, Who then may have salvation?";
B._Mak10_27="Jesus, looking on them, said, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.";
B._Mak10_28="Peter said to him, See, we have given up everything, and come after you.";
B._Mak10_29="Jesus said, Truly I say to you, There is no man who has given up house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or land, because of me and the good news,";
B._Mak10_30="Who will not get a hundred times as much now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and land--though with great troubles; and, in the world to come, eternal life.";
B._Mak10_31="But a great number who are first will be last: and those who are last will be first.";
B._Mak10_32="And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were full of wonder; but those who came after him were in fear. And again he took the twelve, and gave them word of the things which were to come on him,";

B._Mak10_35="And there came to him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying to him, Master, will you give us whatever may be our request?";
B._Mak10_36="And he said to them, What would you have me do for you?";
B._Mak10_37="And they said to him, Let us be seated, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.";

B._Mak10_39="And they said to him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, You will take of the cup from which I take; and the baptism which I am about to undergo you will undergo:";
B._Mak10_40="But to be seated at my right hand or at my left is not for me to give: but it is for those for whom it has been made ready.";
B._Mak10_41="And hearing this, the ten became very angry with James and John.";
B._Mak10_42="And Jesus made them come to him, and said to them, You see that those who are made rulers over the Gentiles are lords over them, and their great ones have authority over them.";
B._Mak10_43="But it is not so among you: but whoever has a desire to become great among you, let him be your servant:";
B._Mak10_44="And whoever has a desire to be first among you, let him be servant of all.";
B._Mak10_45="For truly the Son of man did not come to have servants, but to be a servant, and to give his life for the salvation of men.";
B._Mak10_46="And they came to Jericho: and when he was going out of Jericho, with his disciples and a great number of people, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind man, was seated by the wayside, with his hand out for money.";
B._Mak10_47="And when it came to his ears that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he gave a cry, and said, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.";
B._Mak10_48="And some of them, turning in protest, gave him an order to be quiet: but he went on crying out all the more, Son of David, have mercy on me.";
B._Mak10_49="And Jesus came to a stop and said, Let him come. And crying out to the blind man, they said to him, Be comforted: come, he has sent for you.";
B._Mak10_50="And he, putting off his coat, got up quickly, and came to Jesus.";
B._Mak10_51="And Jesus said to him, What would you have me do to you? And the blind man said, Master, make me able to see.";
B._Mak10_52="And Jesus said to him, Go on your way; your faith has made you well. And straight away he was able to see, and went after him in the way.";
B._Mak11_1="And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Beth-phage and Bethany, at the Mountain of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,";
B._Mak11_2="And said to them, Go into the little town opposite: and when you come to it, you will see a young ass with a cord round his neck, on which no man has ever been seated; let him loose, and come back with him.";
B._Mak11_3="And if anyone says to you, Why are you doing this? say, The Lord has need of him and will send him back straight away.";
B._Mak11_4="And they went away and saw a young ass by the door outside in the open street; and they were getting him loose.";
B._Mak11_5="And some of those who were there said to them, What are you doing, taking the ass?";
B._Mak11_6="And they said to them the words which Jesus had said; and they let them go.";
B._Mak11_7="And they took the young ass to Jesus, and put their clothing on him, and he got on his back.";
B._Mak11_8="And a great number put down their clothing in the way; and others put down branches which they had taken from the fields.";
B._Mak11_9="And those who went in front, and those who came after, were crying, Glory: A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord:";
B._Mak11_10="A blessing on the coming kingdom of our father David: Glory in the highest.";
B._Mak11_11="And he went into Jerusalem into the Temple; and after looking round about on all things, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.";
B._Mak11_12="And on the day after, when they had come out from Bethany, he was in need of food.";
B._Mak11_13="And seeing a fig-tree in the distance with leaves, he went to see if by chance it had anything on it: and when he came to it, he saw nothing but leaves, for it was not the time for the fruit.";
B._Mak11_14="And he said to it, Let no man take fruit from you for ever. And his disciples took note of his words.";
B._Mak11_15="And they came to Jerusalem; and he went into the Temple, and sent out those who were trading there, overturning the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who were offering doves for money;";
B._Mak11_16="And he would not let any man take a vessel through the Temple.";
B._Mak11_17="And he gave them teaching, and said to them, Is it not in the Writings, My house is to be named a house of prayer for all the nations? but you have made it a hole of thieves.";
B._Mak11_18="And it came to the ears of the chief priests and scribes, and they took thought how they might put him to death; being in fear of him, because all the people were full of wonder at his teaching.";
B._Mak11_19="And every evening he went out of the town.";
B._Mak11_20="And when they were going by in the morning, they saw the fig-tree dead from the roots.";
B._Mak11_21="And Peter, having a memory of it, said to him, Master, see, the tree which was cursed by you is dead.";

B._Mak11_23="Truly I say to you, Whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and be put into the sea; and has no doubt in his heart, but has faith that what he says will come about, he will have his desire.";
B._Mak11_24="For this reason I say to you, Whatever you make a request for in prayer, have faith that it has been given to you, and you will have it.";

B._Mak11_30="The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men? give me an answer.";
B._Mak11_31="And they gave thought to it among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not have faith in him?";
B._Mak11_32="But if we say, From men--they were in fear of the people, because all took John to be truly a prophet.";
B._Mak11_33="And they said in answer to Jesus, We have no idea. And Jesus said to them, And I will not say to you by what authority I do these things.";
B._Mak12_1="And he gave them teaching in the form of stories. A man had a vine-garden planted, and put a wall about it, and made a place for crushing out the wine, and put up a tower, and let it out to field-workers, and went into another country.";
B._Mak12_2="And when the time came, he sent a servant to get from the workmen some of the fruit of the garden.";
B._Mak12_3="And they took him, and gave him blows, and sent him away with nothing.";
B._Mak12_4="And again he sent to them another servant; and they gave him wounds on the head, and were very cruel to him.";

B._Mak12_8="And they took him and put him to death, pushing his body out of the garden.";
B._Mak12_9="What then will the master of the garden do? He will come and put the workmen to death, and will give the garden into the hands of others.";
B._Mak12_10="Have you not seen this which is in the Writings: The stone which the builders put on one side, the same was made the chief stone of the building:";
B._Mak12_11="This was the Lord's doing, and it is a wonder in our eyes?";
B._Mak12_12="And they made attempts to take him; but they were in fear of the people, because they saw that the story was against them; and they went away from him.";
B._Mak12_13="Then they sent to him certain of the Pharisees and the Herodians, so that they might make use of his words to take him by a trick.";
B._Mak12_14="And when they had come, they said to him, Master, we are certain that you are true, and have no fear of anyone: you have no respect for a man's position, but you are teaching the true way of God: Is it right to give taxes to Caesar or not?";
B._Mak12_15="Are we to give or not to give? But he, conscious of their false hearts, said to them, Why do you put me to the test? give me a penny, so that I may see it.";
B._Mak12_16="And they gave him one. And he said to them, Whose is this image and name on it? And they said to him, Caesar's.";
B._Mak12_17="And Jesus said to them, Give to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's. And they were full of wonder at him.";
B._Mak12_18="And there came to him Sadducees, who say there is no coming back from the dead; and they put a question to him, saying,";

B._Mak12_22="And all the seven had no seed. Last of all the woman herself came to her death.";
B._Mak12_23="In the future life, when they come back from the dead, whose wife will she be? for the seven had her for a wife.";

B._Mak12_25="When they come back from the dead, they do not get married, but are like the angels in heaven.";
B._Mak12_26="But as to the dead coming back to life; have you not seen in the book of Moses, about the burning thorn-tree, how God said to him, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?";
B._Mak12_27="He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: you are greatly in error.";
B._Mak12_28="And one of the scribes came, and hearing their argument together, and seeing that he had given them a good answer, put the question to him, Which law is the first of all?";
B._Mak12_29="Jesus said in answer, The first is, Give ear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord;";
B._Mak12_30="And you are to have love for the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.";
B._Mak12_31="The second is this, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself. There is no other law greater than these.";
B._Mak12_32="And the scribe said to him, Truly, Master, you have well said that he is one, and there is no other but he:";
B._Mak12_33="And to have love for him with all the heart, and with all the mind, and with all the strength, and to have the same love for his neighbour as for himself, is much more than all forms of offerings.";

B._Mak12_42="And there came a poor widow, and she put in two little bits of money, which make a farthing.";
B._Mak12_43="And he made his disciples come to him, and said to them, Truly I say to you, This poor widow has put in more than all those who are putting money into the box:";
B._Mak12_44="Because they all put in something out of what they had no need for; but she out of her need put in all she had, even all her living.";
B._Mak13_1="And when he was going out of the Temple, one of his disciples said to him, Master, see, what stones and what buildings!";

B._Mak13_22="Because there will be false Christs and false prophets, and they will give signs and wonders in the hope of turning even the saints from the true way.";
B._Mak13_23="But take care; see, I have made all things clear to you before the time.";
B._Mak13_24="But in those days, after that time of trouble, the sun will be made dark and the moon will not give her light,";
