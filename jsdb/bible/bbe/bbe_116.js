B._Jer32_31="For this town has been to me a cause of wrath and of burning passion from the day of its building till this day, so that I put it away from before my face:";
B._Jer32_32="Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to make me angry, they and their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem.";
B._Jer32_33="And they have been turning their backs and not their faces to me: and though I was their teacher, getting up early and teaching them, their ears were not open to teaching.";
B._Jer32_34="But they put their disgusting images into the house which is named by my name, making it unclean.";
B._Jer32_35="And they put up the high places of the Baal in the valley of the son of Hinnom, making their sons and their daughters go through the fire to Molech; which I did not give them orders to do, and it never came into my mind that they would do this disgusting thing, causing Judah to be turned out of the way.";
B._Jer32_36="And now the Lord, the God of Israel, has said of this town, about which you say, It is given into the hands of the king of Babylon by the sword and by need of food and by disease:";
B._Jer32_37="See, I will get them together from all the countries where I have sent them in my wrath and in the heat of my passion and in my bitter feeling; and I will let them come back into this place where they may take their rest safely.";
B._Jer32_38="And they will be my people, and I will be their God:";
B._Jer32_39="And I will give them one heart and one way, so that they may go on in the worship of me for ever, for their good and the good of their children after them:";
B._Jer32_40="And I will make an eternal agreement with them, that I will never give them up, but ever do them good; and I will put the fear of me in their hearts, so that they will not go away from me.";
B._Jer32_41="And truly, I will take pleasure in doing them good, and all my heart and soul will be given to planting them in this land in good faith.";
B._Jer32_42="For the Lord has said: As I have made all this great evil come on this people, so I will send on them all the good which I said about them.";
B._Jer32_43="And there will be trading in fields in this land of which you say, It is a waste, without man or beast; it is given into the hands of the Chaldaeans.";
B._Jer32_44="Men will get fields for money, and put the business in writing, stamping the papers and having them witnessed, in the land of Benjamin and in the country round Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah and in the towns of the hill-country and in the towns of the lowland and in the towns of the South: for I will let their fate be changed, says the Lord.";
B._Jer33_1="Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still shut up in the place of the armed watchmen, saying,";

B._Jer33_3="Let your cry come to me, and I will give you an answer, and let you see great things and secret things of which you had no knowledge.";
B._Jer33_4="For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, has said about the houses of this town and the houses of the kings of Judah, which have been broken down to make earthworks and ...;";
B._Jer33_5="... and to make them full of the dead bodies of men whom I have put to death in my wrath and in my passion, and because of whose evil-doing I have kept my face covered from this town.";
B._Jer33_6="See, I will make it healthy and well again, I will even make them well; I will let them see peace and good faith in full measure.";
B._Jer33_7="And I will let the fate of Judah and of Israel be changed, building them up as at first.";
B._Jer33_8="And I will make them clean from all their sin, with which they have been sinning against me; I will have forgiveness for all their sins, with which they have been sinning against me, and with which they have done evil against me.";
B._Jer33_9="And this town will be to me for a name of joy, for a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth, who, hearing of all the good which I am doing for them, will be shaking with fear because of all the good and the peace which I am doing for it.";
B._Jer33_10="This is what the Lord has said: There will again be sounding in this place, of which you say, It is a waste, without man and without beast; even in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem which are waste and unpeopled, without man and without beast,";
B._Jer33_11="Happy sounds, the voice of joy, the voice of the newly-married man and the voice of the bride, the voices of those who say, Give praise to the Lord of armies, for the Lord is good, for his mercy is unchanging for ever: the voices of those who go with praise into the house of the Lord. For I will let the land come back to its first condition, says the Lord.";
B._Jer33_12="This is what the Lord of armies has said: Again there will be in this place, which is a waste, without man and without beast, and in all its towns, a resting-place where the keepers of sheep will make their flocks take rest.";

B._Jer33_15="In those days and at that time, I will let a Branch of righteousness come up for David; and he will be a judge in righteousness in the land.";
B._Jer33_16="In those days, Judah will have salvation and Jerusalem will be safe: and this is the name which will be given to her: The Lord is our righteousness.";
B._Jer33_17="For the Lord has said, David will never be without a man to take his place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel;";
B._Jer33_18="And the priests and the Levites will never be without a man to come before me, offering burned offerings and perfumes and meal offerings and offerings of beasts at all times.";
B._Jer33_19="And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,";
B._Jer33_20="The Lord has said: If it is possible for my agreement of the day and the night to be broken, so that day and night no longer come at their fixed times,";

B._Jer33_22="As it is not possible for the army of heaven to be numbered, or the sand of the sea measured, so will I make the seed of my servant David, and the Levites my servants.";
B._Jer33_23="And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,";
B._Jer33_24="Have you taken note of what these people have said, The two families, which the Lord took for himself, he has given up? This they say, looking down on my people as being, in their eyes, no longer a nation.";
B._Jer33_25="The Lord has said, If I have not made day and night, and if the limits of heaven and earth have not been fixed by me,";
B._Jer33_26="Then I will give up caring for the seed of Jacob and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will let their fate be changed and will have mercy on them.";
B._Jer34_1="The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, when Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth which were under his rule, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem and all its towns, saying,";

B._Jer34_10="And this was done by all the rulers and the people who had taken part in the agreement, and every one let his man-servant and his servant-girl go free, not to be used as servants any longer; they did so, and let them go.";
B._Jer34_11="But later, they took back again the servants and the servant-girls whom they had let go free, and put them again under the yoke as servants and servant-girls.";
B._Jer34_12="For this reason the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,";

B._Jer34_14="At the end of seven years every man is to let go his countryman who is a Hebrew, who has become yours for a price and has been your servant for six years; you are to let him go free: but your fathers gave no attention and did not give ear.";
