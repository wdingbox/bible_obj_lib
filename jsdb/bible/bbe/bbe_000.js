B._Gen3_16="To the woman he said, Great will be your pain in childbirth; in sorrow will your children come to birth; still your desire will be for your husband, but he will be your master.";
B._Gen3_17="And to Adam he said, Because you gave ear to the voice of your wife and took of the fruit of the tree which I said you were not to take, the earth is cursed on your account; in pain you will get your food from it all your life.";
B._Gen3_18="Thorns and waste plants will come up, and the plants of the field will be your food;";
