B._Eze1_9="They went without turning, every one went straight forward.";
B._Eze1_10="As for the form of their faces, they had the face of a man, and the four of them had the face of a lion on the right side, and the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four of them had the face of an eagle.";
B._Eze1_11="And their wings were separate at the top; two of the wings of every one were joined one to another, and two were covering their bodies.";
B._Eze1_12="Every one of them went straight forward; wherever the spirit was to go they went; they went on without turning.";
B._Eze1_13="And between the living beings it was like burning coals of fire, as if flames were going one after the other between the living beings; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went thunder-flames.";
B._Eze1_14="And the living beings went out and came back as quickly as a thunder-flame.";
B._Eze1_15="Now while I was looking at the four living beings, I saw one wheel on the earth, by the side of the living beings, for the four of them.";
B._Eze1_16="The form of the wheels and their work was like a beryl; the four of them had the same form and design, and they were like a wheel inside a wheel.";
B._Eze1_17="The four of them went straight forward without turning to one side.";
B._Eze1_18="And I saw that they had edges, and their edges, even of the four, were full of eyes round about.";
B._Eze1_19="And when the living beings went on, the wheels went by their side; and when the living beings were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.";
B._Eze1_20="Wherever the spirit was to go they went; and the wheels were lifted up by their side: for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.";
B._Eze1_21="When these went on, the others went; and when these came to rest, the others came to rest; and when these were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up by their side: for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.";
B._Eze1_22="And over the heads of the living beings there was the form of an arch, looking like ice, stretched out over their heads on high.";
B._Eze1_23="Under the arch their wings were straight, one stretched out to another: every one had two wings covering their bodies on this side and two covering their bodies on that side.";
B._Eze1_24="And when they went, the sound of their wings was like the sound of great waters to my ears, like the voice of the Ruler of all, a sound like the rushing of an army: when they came to rest they let down their wings.";
B._Eze1_25="And there was a voice from the top of the arch which was over their heads: when they came to rest they let down their wings.";
B._Eze1_26="And on the top of the arch which was over their heads was the form of a king's seat, like a sapphire stone; and on the form of the seat was the form of a man seated on it on high.";
B._Eze1_27="And I saw it coloured like electrum, with the look of fire in it and round it, going up from what seemed to be the middle of his body; and going down from what seemed to be the middle of his body I saw what was like fire, and there was a bright light shining round him.";
B._Eze1_28="Like the bow in the cloud on a day of rain, so was the light shining round him. And this is what the glory of the Lord was like. And when I saw it I went down on my face, and the voice of one talking came to my ears.";
B._Eze2_1="And he said to me, Son of man, get up on your feet, so that I may say words to you.";
B._Eze2_2="And at his words the spirit came into me and put me on my feet; and his voice came to my ears.";
B._Eze2_3="And he said to me, Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to an uncontrolled nation which has gone against me: they and their fathers have been sinners against me even to this very day.";
B._Eze2_4="And the children are hard and stiff-hearted; I am sending you to them: and you are to say to them, These are the words of the Lord.";
B._Eze2_5="And they, if they give ear to you or if they do not give ear (for they are an uncontrolled people), will see that there has been a prophet among them.";
B._Eze2_6="And you, son of man, have no fear of them or of their words, even if sharp thorns are round you and you are living among scorpions: have no fear of their words and do not be overcome by their looks, for they are an uncontrolled people.";
B._Eze2_7="And you are to give them my words, if they give ear to you or if they do not: for they are uncontrolled.";
B._Eze2_8="But you, son of man, give ear to what I say to you, and do not be uncontrolled like that uncontrolled people: let your mouth be open and take what I give you.";
B._Eze2_9="And looking, I saw a hand stretched out to me, and I saw the roll of a book in it;";
B._Eze2_10="And he put it open before me, and it had writing on the front and on the back; words of grief and sorrow and trouble were recorded in it.";
B._Eze3_1="And he said to me, Son of man, take this roll for your food, and go and say my words to the children of Israel.";
B._Eze3_2="And, on my opening my mouth, he made me take the roll as food.";
B._Eze3_3="And he said to me, Son of man, let your stomach make a meal of it and let your inside be full of this roll which I am giving you. Then I took it, and it was sweet as honey in my mouth.";
B._Eze3_4="And he said to me, Son of man, go now to the children of Israel, and say my words to them.";
B._Eze3_5="For you are not sent to a people whose talk is strange and whose language is hard, but to the children of Israel;";
B._Eze3_6="Not to a number of peoples whose talk is strange and whose language is hard and whose words are not clear to you. Truly, if I sent you to them they would give ear to you.";
B._Eze3_7="But the children of Israel will not give ear to you; for they have no mind to give ear to me: for all the children of Israel have a hard brow and a stiff heart.";
B._Eze3_8="See, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your brow hard against their brows.";
B._Eze3_9="Like a diamond harder than rock I have made your brow: have no fear of them and do not be overcome by their looks, for they are an uncontrolled people.";
B._Eze3_10="Then he said to me, Son of man, take into your heart all my words which I am about to say to you, and let your ears be open to them.";
B._Eze3_11="And go now to those who have been taken away as prisoners, to the children of your people, and say to them, This is what the Lord has said; if they give ear or if they do not.";
B._Eze3_12="Then I was lifted up by the wind, and at my back the sound of a great rushing came to my ears when the glory of the Lord was lifted up from his place.";
B._Eze3_13="And there was the sound of the wings of the living beings touching one another, and the sound of the wheels at their side, the sound of a great rushing.";
B._Eze3_14="And the wind, lifting me up, took me away: and I went in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of the Lord was strong on me.";
B._Eze3_15="Then I came to those who had been taken away as prisoners, who were at Telabib by the river Chebar, and I was seated among them full of wonder for seven days.";
B._Eze3_16="And at the end of seven days, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze3_17="Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the children of Israel: so give ear to the word of my mouth, and give them word from me of their danger.";
B._Eze3_18="When I say to the evil-doer, Death will certainly be your fate; and you give him no word of it and say nothing to make clear to the evil-doer the danger of his evil way, so that he may be safe; that same evil man will come to death in his evil-doing; but I will make you responsible for his blood.";
B._Eze3_19="But if you give the evil-doer word of his danger, and he is not turned from his sin or from his evil way, death will overtake him in his evil-doing; but your life will be safe.";
B._Eze3_20="Again, when an upright man, turning away from his righteousness, does evil, and I put a cause of falling in his way, death will overtake him: because you have given him no word of his danger, death will overtake him in his evil-doing, and there will be no memory of the upright acts which he has done; but I will make you responsible for his blood.";
B._Eze3_21="But if you say to the upright man that he is not to do evil, he will certainly keep his life because he took note of your word; and your life will be safe.";
B._Eze3_22="And the hand of the Lord was on me there; and he said, Get up and go out into the valley and there I will have talk with you.";
B._Eze3_23="Then I got up and went out into the valley; and I saw the glory of the Lord resting there as I had seen it by the river Chebar; and I went down on my face.";
B._Eze3_24="Then the spirit came into me and put me on my feet; and he had talk with me and said to me, Go and keep yourself shut up inside your house.";
B._Eze3_25="But see, O son of man, I will put bands on you, prisoning you in them, and you will not go out among them:";
B._Eze3_26="And I will make your tongue fixed to the roof of your mouth, so that you have no voice and may not make protests to them: for they are an uncontrolled people.";
B._Eze3_27="But when I have talk with you I will make your mouth open, and you are to say to them, This is what the Lord has said: Let the hearer give ear; and as for him who will not, let him keep his ears shut: for they are an uncontrolled people.";
B._Eze4_1="And you, son of man, take a back and put it before you and on it make a picture of a town, even Jerusalem.";
B._Eze4_2="And make an attack on it, shutting it in, building strong places against it, and making high an earthwork against it; and put up tents against it, placing engines all round it for smashing down its walls.";
B._Eze4_3="And take a flat iron plate, and put it for a wall of iron between you and the town: and let your face be turned to it, and it will be shut in and you will make an attack on it. This will be a sign to the children of Israel.";
B._Eze4_4="Then, stretching yourself out on your left side, take the sin of the children of Israel on yourself: for as long as you are stretched out, so long will the sin of the children of Israel be on you.";
B._Eze4_5="For I have had the years of their sin measured for you by a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: and you will take on yourself the sin of the children of Israel.";
B._Eze4_6="And when these days are ended, turning on your right side, you are to take on yourself the sin of the children of Judah: forty days, a day for a year, I have had it fixed for you.";
B._Eze4_7="And let your face be turned to where Jerusalem is shut in, with your arm uncovered, and be a prophet against it.";
B._Eze4_8="And see, I will put bands on you; and you will be stretched out without turning from one side to the other till the days of your attack are ended.";
B._Eze4_9="And take for yourself wheat and barley and different sorts of grain, and put them in one vessel and make bread for yourself from them; all the days when you are stretched on your side it will be your food.";
B._Eze4_10="And you are to take your food by weight, twenty shekels a day: you are to take it at regular times.";
B._Eze4_11="And you are to take water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: you are to take it at regular times.";
B._Eze4_12="And let your food be barley cakes, cooking it before their eyes with the waste which comes out of a man.";
B._Eze4_13="And the Lord said, Even so the children of Israel will have unclean bread for their food among the nations where I am driving them.";
B._Eze4_14="Then I said, Ah, Lord! see, my soul has never been unclean, and I have never taken as my food anything which has come to a natural death or has been broken by beasts, from the time when I was young even till now; no disgusting flesh has ever come into my mouth.";
B._Eze4_15="Then he said to me, See, I have given you cow's waste in place of man's waste, and you will make your bread ready on it.";
B._Eze4_16="And he said to me, Son of man, see, I will take away from Jerusalem her necessary bread: they will take their bread by weight and with care, measuring out their drinking-water with fear and wonder:";
B._Eze4_17="So that they may be in need of bread and water and be wondering at one another, wasting away in their sin.";
B._Eze5_1="And you, son of man, take a sharp sword, using it like a haircutter's blade, and making it go over your head and the hair of your chin: and take scales for separating the hair by weight.";
B._Eze5_2="You are to have a third part burned with fire inside the town, when the days of the attack are ended; and a third part you are to take and give blows with the sword round about it; and give a third part for the wind to take away, and let loose a sword after them.";
B._Eze5_3="And take from them a small number of hairs, folding them in your skirts.";
B._Eze5_4="And again take some of these and put them in the fire, burning them up in the fire; and say to all the children of Israel,";
B._Eze5_5="This is what the Lord has said: This is Jerusalem: I have put her among the nations, and countries are round her on every side;";
B._Eze5_6="And she has gone against my orders by doing evil more than the nations, and against my rules more than the countries round her: for they have given up my orders, and as for my rules, they have not gone in the way of them.";
B._Eze5_7="For this cause the Lord has said: Because you have been more uncontrolled than the nations round about you, and have not been guided by my rules or kept my orders, but have kept the orders of the nations round about you;";
B._Eze5_8="For this cause the Lord has said: See, I, even I, am against you; and I will be judging among you before the eyes of the nations.";
B._Eze5_9="And I will do in you what I have not done and will not do again, because of all your disgusting ways.";
B._Eze5_10="For this cause fathers will take their sons for food among you, and sons will make a meal of their fathers; and I will be judge among you, and all the rest of you I will send away to every wind.";
B._Eze5_11="For this cause, by my life, says the Lord, because you have made my holy place unclean with all your hated things and all your disgusting ways, you will become disgusting to me; my eye will have no mercy and I will have no pity.";
B._Eze5_12="A third of you will come to death from disease, wasting away among you through need of food; a third will be put to the sword round about you; and a third I will send away to every wind, letting loose a sword after them.";
B._Eze5_13="So my wrath will be complete and my passion will come to rest on them; and they will be certain that I the Lord have given the word of decision, when my wrath against them is complete.";
B._Eze5_14="And I will make you a waste and a name of shame among the nations round about you, in the eyes of everyone who goes by.";
B._Eze5_15="And you will be a name of shame and a cause of bitter words, an example and a wonder to the nations round about you, when I give effect to my judging among you in wrath and in passion and in burning protests: I the Lord have said it:";
B._Eze5_16="When I send on you the evil arrows of disease, causing destruction, which I will send to put an end to you; and, further, I will take away your necessary food.";
B._Eze5_17="And I will send on you need of food and evil beasts, and they will be a cause of loss to you; and disease and violent death will go through you; and I will send the sword on you: I the Lord have said it.";
B._Eze6_1="And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze6_2="Son of man, let your face be turned to the mountains of Israel, and be a prophet to them, and say,";
B._Eze6_3="You mountains of Israel, give ear to the words of the Lord: this is what the Lord has said to the mountains and the hills, to the waterways and the valleys: See, I, even I, am sending on you a sword for the destruction of your high places.";
B._Eze6_4="And your altars will be made waste, and your sun-images will be broken: and I will have your dead men placed before your images.";
B._Eze6_5="And I will put the dead bodies of the children of Israel in front of their images, sending your bones in all directions about your altars.";
B._Eze6_6="In all your living-places the towns will become broken walls, and the high places made waste; so that your altars may be broken down and made waste, and your images broken and ended, and so that your sun-images may be cut down and your works rubbed out.";
B._Eze6_7="And the dead will be falling down among you, and you will be certain that I am the Lord.";
B._Eze6_8="But still, I will keep a small band safe from the sword among the nations, when you are sent wandering among the countries.";
B._Eze6_9="And those of you who are kept safe will have me in mind among the nations where they have been taken away as prisoners, how I sent punishment on their hearts which were untrue to me, and on their eyes which were turned to their false gods: and they will be full of hate for themselves because of the evil things which they have done in all their disgusting ways.";
B._Eze6_10="And they will be certain that I am the Lord: not for nothing did I say that I would do this evil to them.";
B._Eze6_11="This is what the Lord has said: Give blows with your hand, stamping with your foot, and say, O sorrow! because of all the evil and disgusting ways of the children of Israel: for death will overtake them by the sword and through need of food and by disease.";
B._Eze6_12="He who is far away will come to his death by disease; he who is near will be put to the sword; he who is shut up will come to his death through need of food; and I will give full effect to my passion against them.";
B._Eze6_13="And you will be certain that I am the Lord, when their dead men are stretched among their images round about their altars on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every branching tree, and under every thick oak-tree, the places where they made sweet smells to all their images.";
B._Eze6_14="And my hand will be stretched out against them, making the land waste and unpeopled, from the waste land to Riblah, through all their living-places: and they will be certain that I am the Lord.";
B._Eze7_1="And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze7_2="And you, son of man, say, This is what the Lord has said to the land of Israel: An end has come, the end has come on the four quarters of the land.";
B._Eze7_3="Now the end has come on you, and I will send my wrath on you, judging you for your ways, I will send punishment on you for all your disgusting acts.";
B._Eze7_4="My eye will not have mercy on you, and I will have no pity: but I will send the punishment of your ways on you, and your disgusting works will be among you: and you will be certain that I am the Lord.";
B._Eze7_5="This is what the Lord has said: An evil, even one evil; see, it is coming.";
B._Eze7_6="An end has come, the end has come; see, it is coming on you.";
B._Eze7_7="The crowning time has come on you, O people of the land: the time has come, the day is near; the day will not be slow in coming, it will not keep back.";
B._Eze7_8="Now, in a little time, I will let loose my passion on you, and give full effect to my wrath against you, judging you for your ways, and sending punishment on you for all your disgusting works.";
B._Eze7_9="My eye will not have mercy, and I will have no pity: I will send on you the punishment of your ways, and your disgusting works will be among you; and you will see that I am the Lord who gives punishment.";
B._Eze7_10="See, the day; see, it is coming: the crowning time has gone out; the twisted way is flowering, pride has put out buds.";
B._Eze7_11="Violent behaviour has been lifted up into a rod of evil; it will not be slow in coming, it will not keep back.";
B._Eze7_12="The time has come, the day is near: let not him who gives a price for goods be glad, or him who gets the price have sorrow:";
B._Eze7_13="For the trader will not go back to the things for which he had his price, even while he is still living:";
B._Eze7_14="And he who has given a price for goods will not get them, for my wrath is on all of them.";
B._Eze7_15="Outside is the sword, and inside disease and need of food: he who is in the open country will be put to the sword; he who is in the town will come to his end through need of food and disease.";
B._Eze7_16="And those of them who get away safely will go and be in the secret places like the doves of the valleys, all of them will come to death, every one in his sin.";
B._Eze7_17="All hands will be feeble and all knees without strength, like water.";
B._Eze7_18="And they will put haircloth round them, and deep fear will be covering them; and shame will be on all faces, and the hair gone from all their heads.";
B._Eze7_19="They will put out their silver into the streets, and their gold will be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold will not be able to keep them safe in the day of the wrath of the Lord; they will not get their desire or have food for their need: because it has been the cause of their falling into sin.";
B._Eze7_20="As for their beautiful ornament, they had put it on high, and had made the images of their disgusting and hated things in it: for this cause I have made it an unclean thing to them.";
B._Eze7_21="And I will give it into the hands of men from strange lands who will take it by force, and to the evil-doers of the earth to have for themselves; and they will make it unholy.";
B._Eze7_22="And my face will be turned away from them, and they will make my secret place unholy: violent men will go into it and make it unholy.";
B._Eze7_23="Make the chain: for the land is full of crimes of blood, and the town is full of violent acts.";
B._Eze7_24="For this reason I will send the worst of the nations and they will take their houses for themselves: I will make the pride of their strength come to an end; and their holy places will be made unclean.";
B._Eze7_25="Shaking fear is coming; and they will be looking for peace, and there will be no peace.";
B._Eze7_26="Destruction will come on destruction, and one story after another; and the vision of the prophet will be shamed, and knowledge of the law will come to an end among the priests, and wisdom among the old.";
B._Eze7_27="The king will give himself up to sorrow, and the ruler will be clothed with wonder, and the hands of the people of the land will be troubled: I will give them punishment for their ways, judging them as it is right for them to be judged; and they will be certain that I am the Lord.";
B._Eze8_1="Now in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, when I was in my house and the responsible men of Judah were seated before me, the hand of the Lord came on me there.";
B._Eze8_2="And looking, I saw a form like fire; from the middle of his body and down there was fire: and up from the middle of his body a sort of shining, like electrum.";
B._Eze8_3="And he put out the form of a hand and took me by the hair of my head; and the wind, lifting me up between the earth and the heaven, took me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the way into the inner door facing to the north; where was the seat of the image of envy.";
B._Eze8_4="And I saw the glory of the Lord there, as in the vision which I saw in the valley.";
B._Eze8_5="Then he said to me, Son of man, now let your eyes be lifted up in the direction of the north; and on looking in the direction of the north, to the north of the doorway of the altar, I saw this image of envy by the way in.";
B._Eze8_6="And he said to me, Son of man, do you see what they are doing? even the very disgusting things which the children of Israel are doing here, causing me to go far away from my holy place? but you will see other most disgusting things.";
B._Eze8_7="And he took me to the door of the open place; and looking, I saw a hole in the wall.";
B._Eze8_8="And he said to me, Son of man, make a hole in the wall: and after making a hole in the wall I saw a door.";
B._Eze8_9="And he said to me, Go in and see the evil and disgusting things which they are doing here.";
B._Eze8_10="So I went in and saw; and there every sort of living thing which goes flat on the earth, and unclean beasts, and all the images of the children of Israel, were pictured round about on the wall.";
B._Eze8_11="And before them seventy of the responsible men of the children of Israel had taken their places, every man with a vessel for burning perfumes in his hand, and in the middle of them was Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan; and a cloud of smoke went up from the burning perfume.";
B._Eze8_12="And he said to me, Son of man, have you seen what the responsible men of the children of Israel do in the dark, every man in his room of pictured images? for they say, The Lord does not see us; the Lord has gone away from the land.";
B._Eze8_13="Then he said to me, You will see even more disgusting things which they do.";
B._Eze8_14="Then he took me to the door of the way into the Lord's house looking to the north; and there women were seated weeping for Tammuz.";
