B._Luk6_20="And turning his eyes to his disciples he said, Happy are you who are poor: for the kingdom of God is yours.";
B._Luk6_21="Happy are you who are in need of food now: for you will be made full. Happy are you who are weeping now; for you will be glad.";
B._Luk6_22="Happy are you, when men have hate for you, and put you away from among them and say angry words to you, turning away in disgust at your name, because of the Son of man.";
B._Luk6_23="Be glad in that day, and be lifted up for joy, for your reward in heaven will be great: for their fathers did these same things to the prophets.";
B._Luk6_24="But unhappy are you who have wealth: for you have been comforted now.";
B._Luk6_25="Unhappy are you who are full of food now: for you will be in need. Unhappy are you who are laughing now: for you will be crying in sorrow.";
B._Luk6_26="Unhappy are you when all men give you their approval: for so their fathers did to the false prophets.";
B._Luk6_27="But I say to you who give ear to me, Have love for those who are against you, do good to those who have hate for you,";
B._Luk6_28="Give blessing to those who give you curses, say prayers for those who are cruel to you.";
B._Luk6_29="If a man gives you a blow on one side of your face, then let the other side be turned to him; from him who takes away your coat, do not keep back your robe.";
B._Luk6_30="Give to everyone who comes with a request, and if a man takes away your property, make no attempt to get it back again.";
B._Luk6_31="Do to others as you would have them do to you.";
B._Luk6_32="If you have love for those who have love for you, what credit is it to you? for even sinners have love for those who have love for them.";
B._Luk6_33="And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is it to you? for even sinners do the same.";
B._Luk6_34="And if you let those have the use of your money, from whom you are hoping to get it back, what credit is it to you? even sinners do so to sinners, hoping to get back as much as they gave.";
B._Luk6_35="But be loving to those who are against you and do them good, and give them your money, not giving up hope, and your reward will be great and you will be the sons of the Most High: for he is kind to evil men, and to those who have hard hearts.";
B._Luk6_36="Be full of pity, even as your Father is full of pity.";
B._Luk6_37="Be not judges of others, and you will not be judged: do not give punishment to others, and you will not get punishment yourselves: make others free, and you will be made free:";
B._Luk6_38="Give, and it will be given to you; good measure, crushed down, full and running over, they will give to you. For in the same measure as you give, it will be given to you again.";
B._Luk6_39="And he gave them teaching in the form of a story, saying, Is it possible for one blind man to be guide to another? will they not go falling together into a hole?";
B._Luk6_40="The disciple is not greater than his master, but everyone whose learning is complete will be like his master.";
B._Luk6_41="And why do you take note of the grain of dust in your brother's eye, but take no note of the bit of wood which is in your eye?";
B._Luk6_42="How will you say to your brother, Brother, let me take the grain of dust out of your eye, when you yourself do not see the bit of wood in your eye? O false one! first take the wood out of your eye and then you will see clearly to take the dust out of your brother's eye.";
B._Luk6_43="For no good tree gives bad fruit, and no bad tree gives good fruit.";
B._Luk6_44="For every tree is judged by its fruit. Men do not get figs from thorns, or grapes from blackberry plants.";
B._Luk6_45="The good man, out of the good store of his heart, gives good things; and the evil man, out of his evil store, gives evil: for out of the full store of the heart come the words of the mouth.";
B._Luk6_46="Why do you say to me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?";
B._Luk6_47="Everyone who comes to me and gives ear to my words and does them, I will make clear to you what he is like:";
B._Luk6_48="He is like a man building a house, who went deep and put the base of it on a rock; and when the water came up and the river was driving against that house, it was not moved, because the building was good.";
B._Luk6_49="But he who gives hearing, without doing, is like a man building a house on the earth without a base for it; and when the force of the river came against it, straight away it came down; and the destruction of that house was great.";
B._Luk7_1="After he had come to the end of all his words in the hearing of the people, he went into Capernaum.";
B._Luk7_2="And a certain captain had a servant who was very dear to him; this servant was ill and near to death.";
B._Luk7_3="And when news of Jesus came to his ears, he sent to him rulers of the Jews, requesting that he would come and make his servant well.";
B._Luk7_4="And they, when they came to Jesus, made their request warmly, saying,";
B._Luk7_5="It is right for you to do this for him, because he is a friend to our nation, and himself has put up a Synagogue for us.";
B._Luk7_6="And Jesus went with them. And when he was not far from the house, the man sent friends to him, saying, Lord, do not give yourself trouble: for I am not important enough for you to come into my house:";
B._Luk7_7="And I had the feeling that I was not even good enough to come to you: but say the word only, and my servant will be well.";
B._Luk7_8="For I, myself, am a man under authority, having men under me; and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.";
B._Luk7_9="And when these things were said to Jesus, he was surprised, and, turning to the mass of people coming after him, said, I have not seen such great faith, no, not in Israel.";
B._Luk7_10="And when those who were sent came back to the house they saw that the servant was well.";
B._Luk7_11="And it came about, after a little time, that he went to a town named Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great number of people.";
B._Luk7_12="Now when he came near the door of the town, a dead man was being taken out, the only son of his mother, who was a widow: and a great number of people from the town were with her.";
B._Luk7_13="And when the Lord saw her, he had pity on her and said to her, Be not sad.";
B._Luk7_14="And he came near, and put his hand on the stretcher where the dead man was: and those who were moving it came to a stop. And he said, Young man, I say to you, Get up.";
B._Luk7_15="And the dead man got up, and words came from his lips. And he gave him to his mother.";
B._Luk7_16="And fear came on all, and they gave praise to God, saying, A great prophet is among us: and, God has given thought to his people.";
B._Luk7_17="And this story about him went through all Judaea and the places round about.";
B._Luk7_18="And the disciples of John gave him an account of all these things.";
B._Luk7_19="Then John sent two of his disciples to the Lord, saying, Are you he who is to come, or are we waiting for another?";
B._Luk7_20="And when the men came to him they said, John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, Are you he who is to come, or are we waiting for another?";
B._Luk7_21="At that time, he made a number of people free from their diseases and their pains, and from evil spirits; and to others who were blind he gave back the use of their eyes.";
B._Luk7_22="And answering them he said, Go back and give news to John of what you have seen, and the things which have come to your ears; the blind now see, those who had no power in their legs are walking, lepers are made clean, those who had no hearing now have their ears open, dead men come to life again, and the poor have the good news given to them.";
B._Luk7_23="And a blessing will be on him who has no doubts about me.";
B._Luk7_24="And when the men who were sent by John had gone away, he said to the people, about John, What did you go out into the waste land to see? a tall stem moving in the wind?";
B._Luk7_25="But what did you go out to see? a man in soft clothing? See now, those who have beautiful clothing and delicate food are in kings' houses.";
B._Luk7_26="But what did you go out to see? a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.";
B._Luk7_27="This is he of whom it has been said, See, I send my servant before your face, who will make ready your way before you.";
B._Luk7_28="I say to you, Among all the sons of women, not one is greater than John: but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.";
B._Luk7_29="(And all the people, and the tax-farmers, to whom John had given baptism, when they had knowledge of these things, gave glory to God.";
B._Luk7_30="But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were against the purpose of God for themselves, not having had his baptism.)";
B._Luk7_31="What comparison am I to make of the men of this generation? what are they like?";
B._Luk7_32="They are like children who are seated in the market-place, crying out to one another, and saying, We made music for you, but you did not take part in the dance; we gave cries of sorrow, but you were not sad.";
B._Luk7_33="For John the Baptist came, taking no food or drink, and you say, He has an evil spirit.";
B._Luk7_34="The Son of man came feasting, and you say, Here is a lover of food and wine, a friend of tax-farmers and sinners.";
B._Luk7_35="But wisdom is judged to be right by all her children.";
B._Luk7_36="And one of the Pharisees made a request that he would take a meal with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house and took his seat at the table.";
B._Luk7_37="And there was a woman in the town who was a sinner; and when she had news that he was a guest in the Pharisee's house, she took a bottle of perfume,";
B._Luk7_38="And went in and took her place at the back of him, near his feet, weeping, so that his feet were washed with the drops from her eyes, and with her hair she made them dry, and kissing his feet she put the perfume on them.";
B._Luk7_39="Now when the Pharisee in whose house he was saw it, he said to himself, This man, if he was a prophet, would be conscious what sort of woman this is who has put her hands on him, that she is a sinner.";
B._Luk7_40="And Jesus, answering, said, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Master, say on.";
B._Luk7_41="And he said, Two men were in debt to a certain man of business: one had a debt of five hundred pence, and the other of fifty.";
B._Luk7_42="When they were unable to make payment, he made the two of them free of their debts. Which of them, now, will have the greater love for him?";
B._Luk7_43="Simon, in answer, said, It seems he whose debt was greater. And he said, Your decision is right.";
B._Luk7_44="And turning to the woman he said to Simon, You see this woman? I came into your house; you did not give me water for my feet: but she has been washing my feet with the drops from her eyes, and drying them with her hair.";
B._Luk7_45="You did not give me a kiss: but she, from the time when I came in, has gone on kissing my feet.";
B._Luk7_46="You put no oil on my head: but she has put perfume on my feet.";
B._Luk7_47="And so I say to you, She will have forgiveness for her sins which are great in number, because of her great love: but he who has small need of forgiveness gives little love.";
B._Luk7_48="And he said to her, You have forgiveness for your sins.";
B._Luk7_49="And those who were seated at table with him said to themselves, Who is this who even gives forgiveness of sins?";
B._Luk7_50="And he said to the woman, By your faith you have salvation; go in peace.";
B._Luk8_1="And it came about, after a short time, that he went through town and country giving the good news of the kingdom of God, and with him were the twelve,";
B._Luk8_2="And certain women who had been made free from evil spirits and diseases, Mary named Magdalene, from whom seven evil spirits had gone out,";
B._Luk8_3="And Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's chief house-servant, and Susanna and a number of others, who gave him of their wealth for his needs.";
B._Luk8_4="And when a great number of people came together, and men from every town went out to him, he gave them teaching in the form of a story:";
B._Luk8_5="A man went out to put in seed, and while he was doing it, some was dropped by the wayside and it was crushed under foot, and was taken by the birds of heaven.";
B._Luk8_6="And some went on the rock, and when it came up it became dry and dead because it had no water.";
B._Luk8_7="And some went among thorns, and the thorns came up with it and it had no room for growth.";
B._Luk8_8="And some falling on good earth, came up and gave fruit a hundred times as much. And with these words he said in a loud voice, He who has ears, let him give ear.";
B._Luk8_9="And his disciples put questions to him about the point of the story.";
B._Luk8_10="And he said, To you is given knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to the others, they are given in stories, so that seeing, they may not see, and though they give hearing, the sense will not be clear to them.";
B._Luk8_11="Now this is the point of the story: The seed is the word of God.";
B._Luk8_12="Those by the side of the road are those who have given hearing; then the Evil One comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not have faith and get salvation.";
B._Luk8_13="And those on the rock are those who with joy give hearing to the word; but having no root, they have faith for a time, and when the test comes they give up.";
B._Luk8_14="And those which went among thorns are those who have given hearing, and go on their way, but they are overcome by cares and wealth and the pleasures of life, and they give no fruit.";
B._Luk8_15="And those in the good earth are those who, having given ear to the word, keep it with a good and true heart, and in quiet strength give fruit.";
B._Luk8_16="No man, when the light is lighted, puts a cover over it, or puts it under a bed, but he puts it on its table, so that those who come in may see the light.";
B._Luk8_17="For nothing is put out of view which will not be made clear, and nothing is secret of which the knowledge will not come to light.";
B._Luk8_18="So take care how you give hearing, for to him who has will be given, and from him who has not will be taken even what he seems to have.";
B._Luk8_19="And his mother and his brothers came to him, and they were not able to get near him because of the great number of people.";
B._Luk8_20="And someone said to him, Your mother and your brothers are outside desiring to see you.";
B._Luk8_21="But he said to them in answer, My mother and my brothers are those who have knowledge of the word of God and do it.";
B._Luk8_22="Now it came about on one of those days that he got into a boat with his disciples; and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the water: and they put out the boat.";
B._Luk8_23="But while they were sailing he went to sleep: and a storm of wind came down on the sea, and the boat became full of water and they were in danger.";
B._Luk8_24="Then they came to him and, awaking him out of his sleep, said, Master, Master, destruction is near. And he, when he was awake, gave orders to the wind and the rolling waves, and the storm came to an end, and all was calm.";
B._Luk8_25="And he said to them, Where is your faith? And fear and wonder overcame them, and they said to one another, Who then is this, who gives orders even to the winds and the water and they do what he says?";
B._Luk8_26="And they came to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.";
B._Luk8_27="And when he had come to the land, there came to him a certain man from the town who had evil spirits; and for a long time he had had no clothing on, and was not living in a house but in the place of the dead.";
B._Luk8_28="And when he saw Jesus, he gave a loud cry and went down on the earth before him and in a loud voice said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Do not be cruel to me.";
B._Luk8_29="For he gave an order to the evil spirit to come out of the man. For frequently it would take a grip of him: and he was kept under control, and prisoned with chains; but parting the chains in two, he would be sent by the driving of the evil spirit into waste places.";
B._Luk8_30="And Jesus said to him, What is your name? And he said, Legion; for a number of spirits had gone into him.";
B._Luk8_31="And they made a request to him that he would not give them an order to go away into the deep.";
B._Luk8_32="Now there was a great herd of pigs in that place, getting food on the mountain: and the evil spirits made a request to him that he would let them go into the pigs, and he let them.";
B._Luk8_33="And the evil spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs: and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the water and came to destruction.";
B._Luk8_34="And when the men who took care of them saw what had come about, they went quickly and gave news of it in the town and the country.";
B._Luk8_35="And they went out to see what had taken place, and they came to Jesus and saw the man out of whom the evil spirits had gone, seated, clothed and with full use of his senses, at the feet of Jesus; and fear came on them.";
B._Luk8_36="And those who had seen it gave them an account of how the man who had the evil spirits was made well.";
B._Luk8_37="And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes made a request to him to go away from them; for they were in great fear: and he got into a boat and went back.";
B._Luk8_38="But the man from whom the evil spirits had gone out had a great desire to be with him, but he sent him away, saying,";
B._Luk8_39="Go back to your house and let them have news of all the great things which God has done for you. And he went away, giving word through all the town of the great things which Jesus had done for him.";
B._Luk8_40="And when Jesus went back, the people were glad to see him, for they were all waiting for him.";
B._Luk8_41="Then there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler in the Synagogue: and he went down at the feet of Jesus, desiring him to come to his house;";
B._Luk8_42="For he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was near to death. But while he was on his way, the people were pushing to be near him.";
B._Luk8_43="And a woman, who had had a flow of blood for twelve years, and had given all her money to medical men, and not one of them was able to make her well,";
B._Luk8_44="Came after him and put her hand on the edge of his robe, and straight away the flowing of her blood was stopped.";
B._Luk8_45="And Jesus said, Who was touching me? And when they all said, It is not I, Peter and those who were with him said, Master, the people are pushing round you on every side.";
B._Luk8_46="But Jesus said, Someone was touching me, for I had the feeling that power had gone out from me.";
B._Luk8_47="And when the woman saw that she was not able to keep it secret, she came, shaking with fear, and falling down before him she made clear before all the people the reason for her touching him, and how she was made well straight away.";
B._Luk8_48="And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.";
B._Luk8_49="While he was still talking, someone came from the house of the ruler of the Synagogue, saying, Your daughter is dead; do not go on troubling the Master.";
B._Luk8_50="But Jesus at these words said to him, Have no fear, only have faith, and she will be made well.";
B._Luk8_51="And when he came to the house he did not let any man go in with him, but only Peter and John and James, and the father of the girl and her mother.";
B._Luk8_52="And all the people were weeping and crying for her; but he said, Do not be sad, for she is not dead, but sleeping.";
B._Luk8_53="And they were laughing at him, being certain that she was dead.";
B._Luk8_54="But he, taking her hand, said to her, My child, get up.";
B._Luk8_55="And her spirit came back to her and she got up straight away: and he gave orders that food was to be given to her.";
B._Luk8_56="And her father and mother were full of wonder, but he gave orders to them to say nothing about it to anyone.";
B._Luk9_1="And getting the twelve together, he gave them power and authority over all evil spirits and over diseases, to make them well.";
B._Luk9_2="And he sent them out to be preachers of the kingdom of God, and to make well those who were ill.";
B._Luk9_3="And he said to them, Take nothing for your journey, no stick or bag or bread or money, and do not take two coats.";
B._Luk9_4="And if you go into a house, let that house be your resting-place till you go away.";
B._Luk9_5="And if any people will not take you in, when you go away from that town, put off its dust from your feet for a witness against them.";
B._Luk9_6="And they went away, journeying through all the towns, preaching the good news and making people free from diseases in all places.";
B._Luk9_7="Now Herod the king had news of all these things: and he was in doubt, because it was said by some people that John had come back from the dead;";
B._Luk9_8="And by some, that Elijah had come; and by others, that one of the old prophets had come back to life.";
B._Luk9_9="And Herod said, I put John to death: but who is this, of whom such stories are given to me? And he had a desire to see him.";
B._Luk9_10="And the twelve, when they came back, gave him an account of what they had done. And he took them with him and went away from the people to a town named Beth-saida.";
B._Luk9_11="But the people, getting news of it, went after him: and he was pleased to see them, and gave them teaching about the kingdom of God, and made those well who were in need of it.";
B._Luk9_12="And the day went on; and the twelve came to him and said, Send these people away so that they may go into the towns and the country round about and get resting-places and food for themselves, for we are in a waste place.";
B._Luk9_13="But he said, Give them food yourselves. And they said, We have only five cakes of bread and two fishes, if we do not go and get food for all these people.";
B._Luk9_14="For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them be seated in groups, about fifty to a group.";
B._Luk9_15="And they did so, and made them all be seated.";
B._Luk9_16="And he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and, looking up to heaven, he said words of blessing over them, and when they had been broken, he gave them to the disciples to give to the people.";
B._Luk9_17="And they all took the food and had enough; and they took up of the broken bits which were over, twelve baskets full.";
B._Luk9_18="And it came about that when he was in prayer, by himself, and the disciples were with him, he put a question to them, saying, Who do the people say I am?";
B._Luk9_19="And they, answering, said, John the Baptist; but others say Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets has come back.";
B._Luk9_20="And he said, But who do you say that I am? And Peter, answering, said, The Christ of God.";
B._Luk9_21="But he gave them special orders, not to say this to any man;";
B._Luk9_22="Saying, The Son of man will undergo much and be put on one side by the rulers and the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and be put to death, and on the third day he will come back to life.";
B._Luk9_23="And he said to them all, If any man has a desire to come after me, let him give up all, and take up his cross every day, and come after me.";
B._Luk9_24="For whoever has a desire to keep his life will have it taken from him, but whoever gives up his life because of me, will keep it.";
B._Luk9_25="For what profit will a man have if he gets all the world, but undergoes loss or destruction himself?";
B._Luk9_26="For if any man has a feeling of shame because of me or of my words, the Son of man will have shame because of him when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.";
B._Luk9_27="But truly I say to you, Some of those who are here now will have no taste of death till they see the kingdom of God.";
B._Luk9_28="And about eight days after he had said these things, he took Peter and John and James with him and went up into the mountain for prayer.";
B._Luk9_29="And while he was in prayer, his face was changed and his clothing became white and shining.";
B._Luk9_30="And two men, Moses and Elijah, were talking with him;";
B._Luk9_31="Who were seen in glory and were talking of his death which was about to take place in Jerusalem.";
B._Luk9_32="Now Peter and those who were with him were overcome with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who were with him.";
B._Luk9_33="And when they were about to go away from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah: having no knowledge of what he was saying.";
B._Luk9_34="And while he said these things, the shade of a cloud came over them, and they were full of fear when they went into the cloud.";
