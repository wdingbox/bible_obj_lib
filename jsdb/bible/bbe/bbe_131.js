B._Dan5_24="Then the part of the hand was sent out from before him, and this writing was recorded.";
B._Dan5_25="And this is the writing which was recorded, Mene, tekel, peres.";
B._Dan5_26="This is the sense of the words: Mene; your kingdom has been numbered by God and ended.";
B._Dan5_27="Tekel; you have been put in the scales and seen to be under weight.";
B._Dan5_28="Peres; your kingdom has been cut up and given to the Medes and Persians.";
B._Dan5_29="Then, by the order of Belshazzar, they put a purple robe on Daniel, and a gold chain round his neck, and a public statement was made that he was to be a ruler of high authority in the kingdom.";
B._Dan5_30="That very night Belshazzar, the king of the Chaldaeans, was put to death.";
B._Dan5_31="And Darius the Mede took the kingdom, being then about sixty-two years old.";
B._Dan6_1="Darius was pleased to put over the kingdom a hundred and twenty captains, who were to be all through the kingdom;";
B._Dan6_2="And over them were three chief rulers, of whom Daniel was one; and the captains were to be responsible to the chief rulers, so that the king might undergo no loss.";
B._Dan6_3="Then this Daniel did his work better than the chief rulers and the captains, because there was a special spirit in him; and it was the king's purpose to put him over all the kingdom.";
B._Dan6_4="Then the chief rulers and the captains were looking for some cause for putting Daniel in the wrong in connection with the kingdom, but they were unable to put forward any wrongdoing or error against him; because he was true, and no error or wrong was to be seen in him.";
B._Dan6_5="Then these men said, We will only get a reason for attacking Daniel in connection with the law of his God.";
B._Dan6_6="Then these chief rulers and the captains came to the king and said to him, O King Darius, have life for ever.";
B._Dan6_7="All the chief rulers of the kingdom, the chiefs and the captains, the wise men and the rulers, have made a common decision to put in force a law having the king's authority, and to give a strong order, that whoever makes any request to any god or man but you, O King, for thirty days, is to be put into the lions' hole.";
B._Dan6_8="Now, O King, put the order in force, signing the writing so that it may not be changed, like the law of the Medes and Persians which may not come to an end.";
B._Dan6_9="For this reason King Darius put his name on the writing and the order.";
B._Dan6_10="And Daniel, on hearing that the writing had been signed, went into his house; (now he had windows in his room on the roof opening in the direction of Jerusalem;) and three times a day he went down on his knees in prayer and praise before his God, as he had done before.";
B._Dan6_11="Then these men were watching and saw Daniel making prayers and requesting grace before his God.";
B._Dan6_12="Then they came near before the king and said, O King, have you not put your name to an order that any man who makes a request to any god or man but you, O King, for thirty days, is to be put into the lions' hole? The king made answer and said, The thing is fixed by the law of the Medes and Persians which may not come to an end.";
B._Dan6_13="Then they made answer and said before the king, Daniel, one of the prisoners of Judah, has no respect for you, O King, or for the order signed by you, but three times a day he makes his prayer to God.";
B._Dan6_14="When this thing came to the king's ears, it was very evil to him, and his heart was fixed on keeping Daniel safe, and till the going down of the sun he was doing everything in his power to get him free.";
B._Dan6_15="Then these men said to the king, Be certain, O King, that by the law of the Medes and Persians no order or law which the king has put into force may be changed.";
B._Dan6_16="Then the king gave the order, and they took Daniel and put him into the lions' hole. The king made answer and said to Daniel, Your God, whose servant you are at all times, will keep you safe.";
B._Dan6_17="Then they got a stone and put it over the mouth of the hole, and it was stamped with the king's stamp and with the stamp of the lords, so that the decision about Daniel might not be changed.";
B._Dan6_18="Then the king went to his great house, and took no food that night, and no ... were placed before him, and his sleep went from him.";
B._Dan6_19="Then very early in the morning the king got up and went quickly to the lions' hole.";
B._Dan6_20="And when he came near the hole where Daniel was, he gave a loud cry of grief; the king made answer and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whose servant you are at all times, able to keep you safe from the lions?";
B._Dan6_21="Then Daniel said to the king, O King, have life for ever.";
B._Dan6_22="My God has sent his angel to keep the lions' mouths shut, and they have done me no damage: because I was seen to be without sin before him; and further, before you, O King, I have done no wrong.";
B._Dan6_23="Then the king was very glad, and gave orders for them to take Daniel up out of the hole. So Daniel was taken up out of the hole and he was seen to be untouched, because he had faith in his God.";
B._Dan6_24="And at the king's order, they took those men who had said evil against Daniel, and put them in the lions' hole, with their wives and their children; and they had not got to the floor of the hole before the lions overcame them and all their bones were broken.";
B._Dan6_25="Then King Darius sent a letter to all the peoples, nations, and languages, living in all the earth: May your peace be increased.";
B._Dan6_26="It is my order that in all the kingdom of which I am ruler, men are to be shaking with fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, unchanging for ever, and his kingdom is one which will never come to destruction, his rule will go on to the end.";
B._Dan6_27="He gives salvation and makes men free from danger, and does signs and wonders in heaven and earth, who has kept Daniel safe from the power of the lions.";
B._Dan6_28="So this Daniel did well in the kingdom of Darius and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian.";
B._Dan7_1="In the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream, and visions came into his head on his bed: then he put the dream in writing.";
B._Dan7_2="I had a vision by night, and saw the four winds of heaven violently moving the great sea.";
B._Dan7_3="And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another.";
B._Dan7_4="The first was like a lion and had eagle's wings; while I was watching its wings were pulled off, and it was lifted up from the earth and placed on two feet like a man, and a man's heart was given to it.";
B._Dan7_5="And I saw another beast, like a bear, and it was lifted up on one side, and three side-bones were in its mouth, between its teeth: and they said to it, Up! take much flesh.";
B._Dan7_6="After this I saw another beast, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings like those of a bird; and the beast had four heads, and the power of a ruler was given to it.";
B._Dan7_7="After this, in my vision of the night, I saw a fourth beast, a thing causing fear and very troubling, full of power and very strong; and it had great iron teeth: it took its food, crushing some of it to bits and stamping down the rest with its feet: it was different from all the beasts before it; and it had ten horns.";
B._Dan7_8="I was watching the horns with care, and I saw another coming up among them, a little one, before which three of the first horns were pulled up by the roots: and there were eyes like a man's eyes in this horn, and a mouth saying great things.";
B._Dan7_9="I went on looking till the seats of kings were placed, and one like a very old man took his seat: his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head was like clean wool; his seat was flames of fire and its wheels burning fire.";
B._Dan7_10="A stream of fire was flowing and coming out from before him: a thousand thousands were his servants, and ten thousand times ten thousand were in their places before him: the judge was seated and the books were open.";
B._Dan7_11="Then I saw--because of the voice of the great words which the horn said--I saw till the beast was put to death, and its body was given to destruction, and the beast was given to the burning of fire.";
B._Dan7_12="As for the rest of the beasts, their authority was taken away: but they let them go on living for a measure of time.";
B._Dan7_13="I saw in visions of the night, and there was coming with the clouds of heaven one like a man, and he came to the one who was very old, and they took him near before him.";
B._Dan7_14="And to him was given authority and glory and a kingdom; and all peoples, nations, and languages were his servants: his authority is an eternal authority which will not come to an end, and his kingdom is one which will not come to destruction.";
B._Dan7_15="As for me, Daniel, my spirit was pained because of this, and the visions of my head were troubling me.";
B._Dan7_16="I came near to one of those who were waiting there, questioning him about what all this was. And he said to me that he would make clear to me the sense of these things.";
B._Dan7_17="These great beasts are four kings who will be cut off from the earth.";
B._Dan7_18="But the saints of the Most High will take the kingdom, and it will be theirs for ever, even for ever and ever.";
B._Dan7_19="Then it was my desire to have certain knowledge about the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, a cause of great fear, whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass; who took his food, crushing some of it to bits and stamping on the rest with his feet;";
B._Dan7_20="And about the ten horns on his head and the other which came up, causing the fall of three; that horn which had eyes, and a mouth saying great things, which seemed to be greater than the other horns.";
B._Dan7_21="And I saw how that horn made war on the saints and overcame them,";
B._Dan7_22="Till he came, who was very old, and the decision was made and the authority was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came when the saints took the kingdom.";
B._Dan7_23="This is what he said: The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom which will come on earth, different from all the kingdoms, and it will overcome all the earth, crushing it down and smashing it.";
B._Dan7_24="And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will come to power; and after them another will come up: he will be different from the first ones and will put down three kings.";
B._Dan7_25="And he will say words against the Most High, attempting to put an end to the saints of the Most High; and he will have the idea of changing times and law; and the saints will be given into his hands for a time and times and half a time.";
B._Dan7_26="But the judge will be seated, and they will put an end to his authority, to overcome it and send complete destruction on it.";
B._Dan7_27="And the kingdom and the authority and the power of the kingdoms under all the heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and all powers will be his servants and do his pleasure.";
B._Dan7_28="Here is the end of the account. As for me, Daniel, I was greatly troubled by my thoughts, and the colour went from my face: but I kept the thing in my heart.";
B._Dan8_1="In the third year of the rule of Belshazzar the king, a vision was seen by me, Daniel, after the one I saw at first.";
B._Dan8_2="And I saw in the vision; and when I saw it, I was in the strong town Shushan, which is in the country of Elam; and in the vision I was by the water-door of the Ulai.";
B._Dan8_3="And lifting up my eyes, I saw, there before the stream, a male sheep with two horns: and the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, the higher one coming up last.";
B._Dan8_4="I saw the sheep pushing to the west and to the north and to the south; and no beasts were able to keep their place before him, and no one was able to get people out of his power; but he did whatever his pleasure was and made himself great.";
B._Dan8_5="And while I was giving thought to this, I saw a he-goat coming from the west over the face of all the earth without touching the earth: and the he-goat had a great horn between his eyes.";
B._Dan8_6="And he came to the two-horned sheep which I saw before the stream, rushing at him in the heat of his power.";
B._Dan8_7="And I saw him come right up to the sheep, and he was moved with wrath against him, attacking the sheep so that his two horns were broken; and the sheep had not strength to keep his place before him, but was pushed down on the earth and crushed under his feet: and there was no one to get the sheep out of his power.";
B._Dan8_8="And the he-goat became very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and in its place came up four other horns turned to the four winds of heaven.";
B._Dan8_9="And out of one of them came another horn, a little one, which became very great, stretching to the south and to the east and to the beautiful land.";
B._Dan8_10="And it became great, even as high as the army of heaven, pulling down some of the army, even of the stars, to the earth and crushing them under its feet.";
B._Dan8_11="It made itself great, even as great as the lord of the army; and by it the regular burned offering was taken away, and the place overturned and the holy place made waste.";
B._Dan8_12="... against the regular burned offering; and ... crushed down to the earth, and it did its pleasure and things went well for it.";
B._Dan8_13="Then there came to my ears the voice of a holy one talking; and another holy one said to that certain one who was talking, How long will the vision be while the regular burned offering is taken away, and the unclean thing causing fear is put up, and the holy place crushed under foot?";
B._Dan8_14="And he said to him, For two thousand, three hundred evenings and mornings; then the holy place will be made clean.";
B._Dan8_15="And it came about that when I, Daniel, had seen this vision, I had a desire for the sense of it to be unfolded; and I saw one before me in the form of a man.";
B._Dan8_16="And the voice of a man came to my ears between the sides of the Ulai, crying out and saying, Gabriel, make the vision clear to this man.";
B._Dan8_17="So he came and took his place near where I was; and when he came, I was full of fear and went down on my face: but he said to me, Let it be clear to you, O son of man; for the vision has to do with the time of the end.";
B._Dan8_18="Now while he was talking to me, I went into a deep sleep with my face to the earth: but touching me, he put me on my feet where I had been.";
B._Dan8_19="And he said, See, I will make clear to you what is to come in the later time of the wrath: for it has to do with the fixed time of the end.";
B._Dan8_20="The sheep which you saw with two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.";
B._Dan8_21="And the he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn between his eyes is the first king.";
B._Dan8_22="And as for that which was broken, in place of which four came up, four kingdoms will come up from his nation, but not with his power.";
B._Dan8_23="And in the later years of their kingdom, when their evil doings have become complete, there will come up a king full of pride and expert in dark sayings.";
B._Dan8_24="And his power will be great, and he will be purposing strange things. And all will go well for him and he will do his pleasure; and he will send destruction on the strong ones.";
B._Dan8_25="And his designs will be turned against the holy people, causing deceit to do well in his hand; in his heart he will make himself great, and send destruction on numbers who are living unconscious of their danger; and he will put himself up against the prince of princes; but he will be broken, though not by men's hands.";
B._Dan8_26="And the vision of evenings and mornings which has been talked of is true: and keep the vision secret; for it has to do with the far-off future.";
B._Dan8_27="And I, Daniel, was ill for some days; then I got up and did the king's business: and I was full of wonder at the vision, but no one was able to give the sense of it.";
B._Dan9_1="In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldaeans;";
B._Dan9_2="In the first year of his rule, I, Daniel, saw clearly from the books the number of years given by the word of the Lord to the prophet Jeremiah, in which the making waste of Jerusalem was to be complete, that is, seventy years.";
B._Dan9_3="And turning my face to the Lord God, I gave myself up to prayer, requesting his grace, going without food, in haircloth and dust.";
B._Dan9_4="And I made prayer to the Lord my God, putting our sins before him, and said, O Lord, the great God, greatly to be feared. keeping your agreement and mercy with those who have love for you and do your orders;";
B._Dan9_5="We are sinners, acting wrongly and doing evil; we have gone against you, turning away from your orders and from your laws:";
B._Dan9_6="We have not given ear to your servants the prophets, who said words in your name to our kings and our rulers and our fathers and all the people of the land.";
B._Dan9_7="O Lord, righteousness is yours, but shame is on us, even to this day; and on the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem, and on all Israel, those who are near and those who are far off, in all the countries where you have sent them because of the sin which they have done against you.";
B._Dan9_8="O Lord, shame is on us, on our kings and our rulers and our fathers, because of our sin against you.";
B._Dan9_9="With the Lord our God are mercies and forgiveness, for we have gone against him;";
B._Dan9_10="And have not given ear to the voice of the Lord our God to go in the way of his laws which he put before us by the mouth of his servants the prophets.";
B._Dan9_11="And all Israel have been sinners against your law, turning away so as not to give ear to your voice: and the curse has been let loose on us, and the oath recorded in the law of Moses, the servant of God, for we have done evil against him.";
B._Dan9_12="And he has given effect to his words which he said against us and against those who were our judges, by sending a great evil on us: for under all heaven there has not been done what has been done to Jerusalem.";
B._Dan9_13="As it was recorded in the law of Moses, all this evil has come on us: but we have made no prayer for grace from the Lord our God that we might be turned from our evil doings and come to true wisdom.";
B._Dan9_14="So the Lord has been watching over this evil and has made it come on us: for the Lord our God is upright in all his acts which he has done, and we have not given ear to his voice.";
B._Dan9_15="And now, O Lord our God, who took your people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand and made a great name for yourself even to this day; we are sinners, we have done evil.";
B._Dan9_16="O Lord, because of your righteousness, let your wrath and your passion be turned away from your town Jerusalem, your holy mountain: because, through our sins and the evil-doing of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a cause of shame to all who are round about us.";
B._Dan9_17="And now, give ear, O our God, to the prayer of your servant and to his request for grace, and let your face be shining on your holy place which is made waste, because of your servants, O Lord.";
B._Dan9_18="O my God, let your ear be turned and give hearing; let your eyes be open and see how we have been made waste and the town which is named by your name: for we are not offering our prayers before you because of our righteousness, but because of your great mercies.";
B._Dan9_19="O Lord, give ear; O Lord, have forgiveness; O Lord, take note and do; let there be no more waiting; for the honour of your name, O my God, because your town and your people are named by your name.";
B._Dan9_20="And while I was still saying these words in prayer, and putting my sins and the sins of my people Israel before the Lord, and requesting grace from the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God;";
B._Dan9_21="Even while I was still in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at first when my weariness was great, put his hand on me about the time of the evening offering.";
B._Dan9_22="And teaching me and talking to me he said, O Daniel, I have come now to give you wisdom.";
B._Dan9_23="At the first word of your prayer a word went out, and I have come to give you knowledge; for you are a man dearly loved: so give thought to the word and let the vision be clear to you.";
B._Dan9_24="Seventy weeks have been fixed for your people and your holy town, to let wrongdoing be complete and sin come to its full limit, and for the clearing away of evil-doing and the coming in of eternal righteousness: so that the vision and the word of the prophet may be stamped as true, and to put the holy oil on a most holy place.";
B._Dan9_25="Have then the certain knowledge that from the going out of the word for the building again of Jerusalem till the coming of a prince, on whom the holy oil has been put, will be seven weeks: in sixty-two weeks its building will be complete, with square and earthwork.";
B._Dan9_26="And at the end of the times, even after the sixty-two weeks, one on whom the holy oil has been put will be cut off and have no ...; and the town and the holy place will be made waste together with a prince; and the end will come with an overflowing of waters, and even to the end there will be war; the making waste which has been fixed.";
B._Dan9_27="And a strong order will be sent out against the great number for one week; and so for half of the week the offering and the meal offering will come to an end; and in its place will be an unclean thing causing fear; till the destruction which has been fixed is let loose on him who has made waste.";
B._Dan10_1="In the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia, a secret was unfolded to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a hard work: and he had knowledge of it, and the vision was clear to him.";
B._Dan10_2="In those days I, Daniel, gave myself up to grief for three full weeks.";
B._Dan10_3="I had no pleasing food, no meat or wine came into my mouth, and I put no oil on my body till three full weeks were ended.";
B._Dan10_4="And on the twenty-fourth day of the first month I was by the side of the great river;";
B._Dan10_5="And lifting up my eyes I saw the form of a man clothed in a linen robe, and round him there was a band of gold, of the best gold:";
B._Dan10_6="And his body was like the beryl, and his face had the look of a thunder-flame, and his eyes were like burning lights, and his arms and feet like the colour of polished brass, and the sound of his voice was like the sound of an army.";
B._Dan10_7="And I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see it; but a great shaking came on them and they went in flight to take cover.";
B._Dan10_8="So I was by myself, and I saw this great vision, and all my strength went from me; and the colour went from my face.";
B._Dan10_9="But the sound of his words came to my ears, and on hearing his voice I went into a deep sleep with my face to the earth.";
B._Dan10_10="Then a hand gave me a touch, awaking me, and putting me on my knees and my hands.";
B._Dan10_11="And he said to me, O Daniel, you man dearly loved, take in the sense of the words I say to you and get up on to your feet: for to you I am now sent; and when he had said this to me I got on to my feet, shaking with fear.";
B._Dan10_12="Then he said to me, Have no fear, Daniel; for from the first day when you gave your heart to getting wisdom and making yourself poor in spirit before your God, your words have come to his ears: and I have come because of your words.";
B._Dan10_13="But the angel of the kingdom of Persia put himself against me for twenty-one days; but Michael, one of the chief angels, came to my help; and when I came he was still there with the angel of the kings of Persia.";
B._Dan10_14="Now I have come to give you knowledge of the fate of your people in the later days; for there is still a vision for the days.";
B._Dan10_15="And after he had said these words to me, I kept my face turned to the earth and was unable to say anything.";
B._Dan10_16="Then one whose form was like the sons of men put his finger on my lips; and opening my mouth, I said to him who was before me, O my lord, because of the vision my pains have come on me, and I have no more strength.";
B._Dan10_17="For how may this servant of my lord have talk with my lord? for, as for me, straight away my strength went from me and there was no breath in my body.";
B._Dan10_18="Then again one having the form of a man put his hand on me and gave me strength.";
B._Dan10_19="And he said to me, O man greatly loved, have no fear: peace be with you, be strong and let your heart be lifted up. And at his words I became strong, and said, Let my lord say on, for you have given me strength.";
