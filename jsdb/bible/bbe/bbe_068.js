B._1Ch29_29="Now all the acts of David, first and last, are recorded in the words of Samuel the seer, and the words of Nathan the prophet, and the words of Gad the seer;";
B._1Ch29_30="Together with all his rule and his power, and the events which took place in his time, in Israel and in all the kingdoms of other lands.";
B._2Ch1_1="And Solomon, the son of David, made himself strong in his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and made him very great.";
B._2Ch1_2="And Solomon sent word to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every chief in all Israel, heads of their families.";
B._2Ch1_3="Then Solomon, and all the men of Israel with him, went to the high place at Gibeon, because the Tent of meeting of God, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, had made in the waste land, was there.";
B._2Ch1_4="But the ark of God had been moved by David from Kiriath-jearim to the place which he had made ready for it, for he had put up a tent for it at Jerusalem.";
B._2Ch1_5="And the altar of brass which Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the Tent of the Lord; and Solomon and all the people went to give worship there.";
B._2Ch1_6="And Solomon went up there to the brass altar before the Lord at the Tent of meeting, offering on it a thousand burned offerings.";
B._2Ch1_7="In that night God came to Solomon in a vision, and said to him, Say what I am to give you.";
B._2Ch1_8="And Solomon said to God, Great was your mercy to David my father, and you have made me king in his place.";
B._2Ch1_9="Now, O Lord God, let your word to David my father come true; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in number.";
B._2Ch1_10="Give me now wisdom and knowledge, so that I may go out and come in before this people: for who is able to be the judge of this great people of yours?";
B._2Ch1_11="And God said to Solomon, Because this was in your heart, and you did not make request for money, property, or honour, or for the destruction of your haters, or for long life; but you have made request for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, so that you may be the judge of my people over whom I have made you king:";
B._2Ch1_12="Wisdom and knowledge are given to you; and I will give you wealth and honour, such as no king has had before you or ever will have after you.";
B._2Ch1_13="So Solomon went back from the high place at Gibeon, from before the Tent of meeting, to Jerusalem; and he was king over Israel.";
B._2Ch1_14="And Solomon got together war-carriages and horsemen; he had one thousand, four hundred carriages and twelve thousand horsemen, which he kept, some in the carriage-towns and some with the king at Jerusalem.";
B._2Ch1_15="And the king made silver and gold as common as stones in Jerusalem, and cedar like the sycamore-trees of the lowland in number.";
B._2Ch1_16="And Solomon's horses came out of Egypt; the king's traders got them from Kue at a price.";
B._2Ch1_17="A war-carriage might be got from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: they got them at the same rate for all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.";
B._2Ch2_1="Now it was Solomon's purpose to put up a house for the name of the Lord and a house for himself as king.";
B._2Ch2_2="And Solomon had seventy thousand men numbered for transport, and eighty thousand for cutting stone in the mountains, and three thousand, six hundred as overseers.";
B._2Ch2_3="And Solomon sent to Huram, king of Tyre, saying, As you did for my father David, sending him cedar-trees for the building of his house,";
B._2Ch2_4="See!

This is a law for ever to Israel.";
B._2Ch2_5="And the house which I am building is to be great, for our God is greater than all gods.";
B._2Ch2_6="But who may have strength enough to make a house for him, seeing that the heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be his resting-place? who am I then to make a house for him? But I am building it only for the burning of perfume before him.";
B._2Ch2_7="So now send me an expert worker in gold and silver and brass and iron? in purple and red and blue, and in the cutting of all sorts of ornament, to be with the expert workmen who are here in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom my father David got together.";
B._2Ch2_8="And send me cedar-trees, cypress-trees and sandal-wood from Lebanon, for, to my knowledge, your servants are expert wood-cutters in Lebanon; and my servants will be with yours,";
B._2Ch2_9="To get trees for me in great numbers, for the house which I am building is to be great and a wonder.";
B._2Ch2_10="And I will give as food to your servants, the wood-cutters, twenty thousand measures of grain, and twenty thousand measures of barley and twenty thousand measures of wine and twenty thousand measures of oil.";
B._2Ch2_11="Then Huram, king of Tyre, sent Solomon an answer in writing, saying, Because of his love for his people the Lord has made you king over them.";

B._2Ch2_14="The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, whose father was a man of Tyre, an expert worker in gold and silver and brass and iron, in stone and wood, in purple and blue and fair linen and red, trained in the cutting of every sort of ornament and the invention of every sort of design; let him be given a place among your expert workmen and those of my lord, your father David.";
B._2Ch2_15="So now let my lord send to his servants the grain and the oil and the wine as my lord has said;";
B._2Ch2_16="And we will have wood cut from Lebanon, as much as you have need of, and will send it to you on flat boats by sea to Joppa, and from there you may take it up to Jerusalem.";
B._2Ch2_17="Then Solomon took the number of all the men from strange lands who were living in Israel, as his father David had done; there were a hundred and fifty-three thousand, six hundred.";
B._2Ch2_18="Seventy thousand he put to the work of transport, eighty thousand to cutting stone in the mountains, and three thousand, six hundred as overseers to put the people to work.";
B._2Ch3_1="Then Solomon made a start at building the house of the Lord on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem, where the Lord had been seen by his father David, in the place which David had made ready in the grain-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.";
B._2Ch3_2="The building was started in the second month in the fourth year of his rule.";
B._2Ch3_3="And Solomon put the base of the house of God in position; by the older measure it was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide.";
B._2Ch3_4="And the covered way in front of the house was twenty cubits long, as wide as the house, and a hundred and twenty cubits high, all plated inside with the best gold.";
B._2Ch3_5="And the greater house was roofed with cypress-wood, plated with the best gold and ornamented with designs of palm-trees and chains.";
