B._Mak14_22="And while they were taking food, he took bread, and after blessing it, he gave the broken bread to them, and said, Take it: this is my body.";
B._Mak14_23="And he took a cup, and when he had given praise, he gave it to them: and they all had a drink from it.";
B._Mak14_24="And he said to them, This is my blood of the testament, which is given for men.";
B._Mak14_25="Truly I say to you, I will take no more of the fruit of the vine till the day when I take it new in the kingdom of God.";
B._Mak14_26="And after a song of praise to God they went out to the Mountain of Olives.";
B._Mak14_27="And Jesus said to them, You will all be turned away from me: for it is in the Writings, I will put the keeper of the sheep to death, and the sheep will be put to flight.";
B._Mak14_28="But after I have come back from the dead, I will go before you into Galilee.";
B._Mak14_29="But Peter said to him, Though the others may be turned away from you, I will not.";
B._Mak14_30="And Jesus said to him, Truly, I say to you that you, today, even this night, before the cock's second cry, will say three times that you have no knowledge of me.";
B._Mak14_31="But he said with passion, If I have to be put to death with you, I will not be false to you. And they all said the same.";
B._Mak14_32="And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he said to his disciples, Be seated here while I say a prayer.";
B._Mak14_33="And he took with him Peter and James and John, and grief and great trouble came on him.";
B._Mak14_34="And he said to them, My soul is very sad, even to death: be here a little time, and keep watch.";
B._Mak14_35="And he went forward a little, and falling down on the earth, made request that, if possible, the hour might go from him.";
B._Mak14_36="And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; take away this cup from me: but even so let not my pleasure, but yours be done.";
B._Mak14_37="And he came, and saw them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? were you not able to keep watch one hour?";
B._Mak14_38="Keep watch with prayer, so that you may not be put to the test; the spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is feeble.";
B._Mak14_39="And again he went away, and said a prayer, using the same words.";
B._Mak14_40="And again he came and saw them sleeping, because their eyes were very tired; and they had nothing to say in answer.";
B._Mak14_41="And he came the third time, and said to them, Go on sleeping now and take your rest: it is enough; the hour has come; see, the Son of man is given up into the hands of evil men.";
B._Mak14_42="Get up, let us be going; see, he who gives me up is near.";
B._Mak14_43="And straight away, while he was still talking, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great band with swords and sticks, from the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority.";
B._Mak14_44="Now he who had been false to him had given them a sign, saying, The one to whom I give a kiss, that is he; take him, and get him away safely.";
B._Mak14_45="And when he had come, he went straight to him and said, Master; and gave him a kiss.";
B._Mak14_46="And they put their hands on him, and took him.";
B._Mak14_47="But a certain one of those who were near took out his sword, and gave the servant of the high priest a blow, cutting off his ear.";
B._Mak14_48="And Jesus said to them, Have you come out as against a thief, with swords and sticks to take me?";
B._Mak14_49="I was with you every day in the Temple teaching, and you did not take me; but this is done so that the Writings may come true.";
B._Mak14_50="And they all went away from him in fear.";
B._Mak14_51="And a certain young man went after him, with only a linen cloth about his body; and they put their hands on him;";
B._Mak14_52="But he got away unclothed, without the linen cloth.";
B._Mak14_53="And they took Jesus away to the high priest; and there came together with him all the chief priests and those in authority and the scribes.";
B._Mak14_54="And Peter had come after him at a distance, even into the house of the high priest; and he was seated with the captains, warming himself in the light of the fire.";
B._Mak14_55="Now the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for witness against Jesus so that they might put him to death; and they were unable to get any.";
B._Mak14_56="For a number gave false witness against him and their witness was not in agreement.";
B._Mak14_57="Then some got up and gave false witness against him, saying,";
B._Mak14_58="He said in our hearing, I will put an end to this Temple which is made with hands, and in three days I will make another without hands.";
B._Mak14_59="And even so their witness was not in agreement.";
B._Mak14_60="And the high priest got up in the middle of them, and said to Jesus, Do you say nothing in answer? what is it which these say against you?";
B._Mak14_61="But he kept quiet and said nothing. Again the high priest questioning him said, Are you the Christ, the son of the Holy One?";
B._Mak14_62="And Jesus said, I am: and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.";
B._Mak14_63="And the high priest, violently parting his robes, said, What more need have we of witnesses?";
B._Mak14_64="His words against God have come to your ears: what is your opinion? And they all said it was right for him to be put to death.";
B._Mak14_65="And some put shame on him and, covering his face, gave him blows and said to him, Now say what is to come: and the captains took him and gave him blows with their hands.";
B._Mak14_66="And while Peter was down in the open square of the building, one of the servant-girls of the high priest came;";
B._Mak14_67="And seeing Peter warming himself by the fire, she gave him a look, and said, You were with this Nazarene, even Jesus.";
B._Mak14_68="But he said, I have no knowledge of him, or of what you are saying: and he went out into the doorway; and there came the cry of a cock.";
B._Mak14_69="And the girl saw him, and said again to those who were near, This is one of them.";
B._Mak14_70="But again he said it was not so. And after a little time, again those who were near said to Peter, Truly you are one of them; for you are a Galilaean.";
B._Mak14_71="But, with curses and oaths, he said, I have no knowledge of the man about whom you are talking.";
B._Mak14_72="And in the same minute, the cock gave a second cry. And it came to Peter's mind how Jesus had said to him, Before the cock's second cry, you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me. And at this thought he was overcome with weeping.";
B._Mak15_1="And the first thing in the morning the chief priests, with those in authority and the scribes and all the Sanhedrin, had a meeting, and put cords round Jesus, and took him away, and gave him up to Pilate.";
B._Mak15_2="And Pilate put a question to him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he, answering, said to him, You say so.";
B._Mak15_3="And the chief priests said a number of things against him.";
B._Mak15_4="And Pilate again put a question, Do you say nothing in answer? see how much evil they say you have done.";
B._Mak15_5="But Jesus gave no more answers, so that Pilate was full of wonder.";
B._Mak15_6="Now at the feast every year he let one prisoner go free at their request.";
B._Mak15_7="And there was one named Barabbas, in prison with those who had gone against the government and in the fight had taken life.";
B._Mak15_8="And the people went up, requesting him to do as he had done for them in other years.";
B._Mak15_9="And Pilate said in answer to them, Is it your desire that I let the King of the Jews go free?";
B._Mak15_10="For he saw that the chief priests had given him up through envy.";
B._Mak15_11="But the people were moved by the chief priests to make him let Barabbas go free.";
B._Mak15_12="And Pilate again said in answer to them, What then am I to do to him to whom you give the name of the King of the Jews?";
B._Mak15_13="And they said again loudly, To the cross with him!";
B._Mak15_14="And Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? But their cry was the louder, To the cross!";
B._Mak15_15="And Pilate, desiring to do what was pleasing to the people, let Barabbas go free, and gave up Jesus, when he had been whipped, to be put to death on the cross.";
B._Mak15_16="And the men of the army took him away into the square in front of the building which is the Praetorium, and they got together all the band.";
B._Mak15_17="And they put a purple robe on him, and twisting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;";
B._Mak15_18="And, as if honouring him, they said, Long life to the King of the Jews!";
B._Mak15_19="And they gave him blows on the head with a stick and put shame on him and, going down on their knees, gave him worship.";
B._Mak15_20="And when they had made sport of him, they took the purple robe off him and put his clothing on him. And they took him out to put him to death on the cross.";
B._Mak15_21="And they made one, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, who was going by, coming from the country, go with them, so that he might take his cross.";
B._Mak15_22="And they took him to the place named Golgotha, which is, Dead Man's Head.";
B._Mak15_23="And they gave him wine mixed with myrrh; but he did not take it.";
B._Mak15_24="And he was nailed to the cross; and they made a division of his clothing among them, putting to the decision of chance what everyone was to take.";
B._Mak15_25="And it was the third hour when they put him on the cross.";
B._Mak15_26="And the statement of his crime was put in writing on the cross, THE KING OF THE JEWS.";
B._Mak15_27="And they put two thieves on crosses with him, one on his right side, and one on his left.";
B._Mak15_28="[]";
B._Mak15_29="And those who went by made sport of him, shaking their heads, and saying, Ha! you who give the Temple to destruction, and put it up again in three days,";
B._Mak15_30="Keep yourself from death, and come down from the cross.";
B._Mak15_31="In the same way the chief priests, laughing at him among themselves with the scribes, said, A saviour of others, he has no salvation for himself.";
B._Mak15_32="Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and have belief. And those who were put on crosses with him said evil things against him.";
B._Mak15_33="And when the sixth hour had come, it was dark over all the land till the ninth hour.";
B._Mak15_34="And at the ninth hour, Jesus said in a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, My God, my God, why are you turned away from me?";
B._Mak15_35="And some of those who were near, hearing it, said, See, he is crying to Elijah.";
B._Mak15_36="And one of them went quickly and, getting a sponge full of bitter wine, put it on a rod, and gave it to him for drink, saying, Let be; let us see if Elijah will come to take him down.";
B._Mak15_37="And Jesus gave a loud cry, and gave up his spirit.";
B._Mak15_38="And the curtain of the Temple was parted in two from end to end.";
B._Mak15_39="And when the captain, who was near, saw how he gave up his spirit, he said, Truly this man was a son of God.";
B._Mak15_40="And there were women watching from a distance: among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome,";
B._Mak15_41="Who went with him when he was in Galilee and took care of him; and a number of other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.";
B._Mak15_42="And when it was evening, because it was the time of getting ready, that is, the day before the Sabbath,";
B._Mak15_43="There came Joseph of Arimathaea, a responsible man in high honour, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God; and he went in to Pilate without fear, and made a request for the body of Jesus.";
B._Mak15_44="And Pilate was surprised that he was dead; and, sending for the captain, he put a question to see if he had been dead for long.";
B._Mak15_45="And when he had news of it from the captain, he let Joseph have the body.";
B._Mak15_46="And he got a linen cloth and, taking him down, put the linen cloth round him, and put him in a place for the dead which had been cut out of a rock; and a stone was rolled against the door.";
B._Mak15_47="And Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was put.";
B._Mak16_1="And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of James, and Salome, got spices, so that they might come and put them on him.";
B._Mak16_2="And very early after dawn on the first day of the week, they came at the time of the coming up of the sun to the place where the body had been put.";
B._Mak16_3="And they were saying among themselves, Who will get the stone rolled away from the door for us?";
B._Mak16_4="And looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back; and it was of great size.";
B._Mak16_5="And when they went in, they saw a young man seated on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were full of wonder.";
B._Mak16_6="And he said to them, Do not be troubled: you are looking for Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been put to death on the cross; he has come back from the dead; he is not here: see, the place where they put him!";
B._Mak16_7="But go, say to his disciples and to Peter, He goes before you into Galilee: there you will see him, as he said to you.";
B._Mak16_8="And they went out quickly from the place, because fear and great wonder had come on them: and they said nothing to anyone, because they were full of fear that ...";
B._Mak16_9="Now when he came back from the dead early on the first day of the week, he went first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had sent out seven evil spirits.";
B._Mak16_10="She went and gave news of it to those who had been with him, while they were sorrowing and weeping.";
B._Mak16_11="And they, when it came to their ears that he was living, and had been seen by her, had no belief in it.";
B._Mak16_12="And after these things he was seen in another form by two of them, while they were walking on their way into the country.";
B._Mak16_13="And they went away and gave news of it to the rest; and they had no belief in what was said.";
B._Mak16_14="And later he was seen by the eleven themselves while they were taking food; and he said sharp words to them because they had no faith and their hearts were hard, and because they had no belief in those who had seen him after he had come back from the dead.";
B._Mak16_15="And he said to them, Go into all the world, and give the good news to everyone.";
B._Mak16_16="He who has faith and is given baptism will get salvation; but he who has not faith will be judged.";
B._Mak16_17="And these signs will be with those who have faith: in my name they will send out evil spirits; and they will make use of new languages;";
B._Mak16_18="They will take up snakes, and if there is poison in their drink, it will do them no evil; they will put their hands on those who are ill, and they will get well.";
B._Mak16_19="So then the Lord Jesus, after he had said these words to them, was taken up into heaven and took his seat at the right hand of God.";
B._Mak16_20="And they went out, preaching everywhere, the Lord working with them, and giving witness to the word by the signs which came after. So be it.";
B._Luk1_1="As a number of attempts have been made to put together in order an account of those events which took place among us,";
B._Luk1_2="As they were handed down to us by those who saw them from the first and were preachers of the word,";
B._Luk1_3="It seemed good to me, having made observation, with great care, of the direction of events in their order, to put the facts in writing for you, most noble Theophilus;";
B._Luk1_4="So that you might have certain knowledge of those things about which you were given teaching.";
B._Luk1_5="In the days of Herod, king of Judaea, there was a certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the order of Abijah; and he had a wife of the family of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.";
B._Luk1_6="They were upright in the eyes of God, keeping all the rules and orders of God, and doing no wrong.";
B._Luk1_7="And they were without children, because Elisabeth had never given birth, and they were at that time very old.";
B._Luk1_8="Now it came about that in his turn he was acting as priest before God,";
B._Luk1_9="And as was the way of the priests, he had to go into the Temple to see to the burning of perfumes.";
B._Luk1_10="And all the people were offering prayers outside, at the time of the burning of perfumes.";
B._Luk1_11="And he saw an angel of the Lord in his place on the right side of the altar.";
B._Luk1_12="And Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear came on him.";
B._Luk1_13="But the angel said, Have no fear, Zacharias, for your prayer has come to the ears of God, and your wife Elisabeth will have a son, and his name will be John.";
B._Luk1_14="And you will be glad and have great delight; and numbers of people will have joy at his birth.";
B._Luk1_15="For he will be great in the eyes of the Lord; he will not take wine or strong drink; and he will be full of the Spirit of God from his birth.";
B._Luk1_16="And through him great numbers of the children of Israel will be turned to the Lord their God.";
B._Luk1_17="And he will go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, turning the hearts of fathers to their children, and wrongdoers to the way of righteousness; to make ready a people whose hearts have been turned to the Lord.";
B._Luk1_18="And Zacharias said to the angel, How may I be certain of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is far on in years.";
B._Luk1_19="And the angel, answering, said, I am Gabriel, whose place is before God; I have been sent to say these words to you and to give you this good news.";
B._Luk1_20="Now, see, you will be without voice or language till the day when these things come about, because you had not faith in my words, which will have effect at the right time.";
B._Luk1_21="And the people were waiting for Zacharias and were surprised because he was in the Temple for such a long time.";
B._Luk1_22="And when he came out he was not able to say anything, and they saw that he had seen a vision in the Temple; and he was making signs to them without words.";
B._Luk1_23="And when the days of his work in the Temple were ended, he went back to his house.";
B._Luk1_24="After that time, Elisabeth, being certain that she was to become a mother, kept herself from men's eyes for five months, saying,";
B._Luk1_25="The Lord has done this to me, for his eyes were on me, to take away my shame in the eyes of men.";
B._Luk1_26="Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee, named Nazareth,";
B._Luk1_27="To a virgin who was to be married to a man named Joseph, of the family of David; and the name of the virgin was Mary.";
B._Luk1_28="And the angel came in to her and said, Peace be with you, to whom special grace has been given; the Lord is with you.";
B._Luk1_29="But she was greatly troubled at his words, and said to herself, What may be the purpose of these words?";
B._Luk1_30="And the angel said to her, Have no fear, Mary, for you have God's approval.";
B._Luk1_31="And see, you will give birth to a son, and his name will be Jesus.";
B._Luk1_32="He will be great, and will be named the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God will give him the kingdom of David, his father:";
B._Luk1_33="He will have rule over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.";
B._Luk1_34="And Mary said to the angel, How may this be, because I have had no knowledge of a man?";
B._Luk1_35="And the angel in answer said to her, The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will come to rest on you, and so that which will come to birth will be named holy, Son of God.";
B._Luk1_36="Even now Elisabeth, who is of your family, is to be a mother, though she is old: and this is the sixth month with her who was without children.";
B._Luk1_37="For there is nothing which God is not able to do.";
B._Luk1_38="And Mary said: I am the servant of the Lord; may it be to me as you say. And the angel went away.";
B._Luk1_39="Then Mary got up and went quickly into the high lands, to a town of Judah;";
B._Luk1_40="And went into the house of Zacharias and took Elisabeth in her arms.";
B._Luk1_41="And when the voice of Mary came to the ears of Elisabeth, the baby made a sudden move inside her; then Elisabeth was full of the Holy Spirit,";
B._Luk1_42="And she said with a loud voice: May blessing be on you among women, and a blessing on the child of your body.";
B._Luk1_43="How is it that the mother of my Lord comes to me?";
B._Luk1_44="For, truly, when the sound of your voice came to my ears, the baby in my body made a sudden move for joy.";
B._Luk1_45="Happy will she be who had faith that the things which the Lord has said to her will be done.";
B._Luk1_46="And Mary said: My soul gives glory to God;";
B._Luk1_47="My spirit is glad in God my Saviour.";
B._Luk1_48="For he has had pity on his servant, though she is poor and lowly placed: and from this hour will all generations give witness to the blessing which has come to me.";
B._Luk1_49="For he who is strong has done great things for me; and holy is his name.";
B._Luk1_50="His mercy is for all generations in whom is the fear of him.";
B._Luk1_51="With his arm he has done acts of power; he has put to flight those who have pride in their hearts.";
B._Luk1_52="He has put down kings from their seats, lifting up on high the men of low degree.";
B._Luk1_53="Those who had no food he made full of good things; the men of wealth he sent away with nothing in their hands;";
B._Luk1_54="His help he has given to Israel, his servant, so that he might keep in mind his mercy to Abraham and his seed for ever,";
B._Luk1_55="As he gave his word to our fathers.";
B._Luk1_56="And Mary was with her for about three months and then went back to her house.";
B._Luk1_57="Now it was time for Elisabeth to give birth, and she had a son.";
B._Luk1_58="And it came to the ears of her neighbours and relations that the Lord had been very good to her, and they took part in her joy.";
B._Luk1_59="And on the eighth day they came to see to the circumcision of the child, and they would have given him the name of Zacharias, his father's name;";
B._Luk1_60="But his mother made answer and said, No, his name is John.";
B._Luk1_61="And they said, Not one of your relations has that name.";
B._Luk1_62="And they made signs to his father, to say what name was to be given to him.";
B._Luk1_63="And he sent for writing materials and put down: His name is John; and they were all surprised.";
B._Luk1_64="And straight away his mouth was open and his tongue was free and he gave praise to God.";
B._Luk1_65="And fear came on all those who were living round about them: and there was much talk about all these things in all the hill-country of Judaea.";
B._Luk1_66="And all who had word of them kept them in their minds and said, What will this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.";
B._Luk1_67="And his father, Zacharias, was full of the Holy Spirit, and with the voice of a prophet said these words:";
B._Luk1_68="Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, for he has come to his people and made them free,";
B._Luk1_69="Lifting up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,";
B._Luk1_70="(As he said, by the mouth of his holy prophets, from the earliest times,)";
B._Luk1_71="Salvation from those who are against us, and from the hands of those who have hate for us;";
B._Luk1_72="To do acts of mercy to our fathers and to keep in mind his holy word,";
B._Luk1_73="The oath which he made to Abraham, our father,";
B._Luk1_74="That we, being made free from the fear of those who are against us, might give him worship,";
B._Luk1_75="In righteousness and holy living before him all our days.";
B._Luk1_76="And you, child, will be named the prophet of the Most High: you will go before the face of the Lord, to make ready his ways;";
B._Luk1_77="To give knowledge of salvation to his people, through the forgiveness of sins,";
B._Luk1_78="Because of the loving mercies of our God, by which the dawn from heaven has come to us,";
B._Luk1_79="To give light to those in dark places, and in the shade of death, so that our feet may be guided into the way of peace.";
B._Luk1_80="And the child became tall, and strong in spirit; and he was living in the waste land till the day when he came before the eyes of Israel.";
B._Luk2_1="Now it came about in those days that an order went out from Caesar Augustus that there was to be a numbering of all the world.";
B._Luk2_2="This was the first numbering, which was made when Quirinius was ruler of Syria.";
B._Luk2_3="And all men went to be numbered, everyone to his town.";
B._Luk2_4="And Joseph went up from Galilee, out of the town of Nazareth, into Judaea, to Beth-lehem, the town of David, because he was of the house and family of David,";
B._Luk2_5="To be put on the list with Mary, his future wife, who was about to become a mother.";
B._Luk2_6="And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth.";
