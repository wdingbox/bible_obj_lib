B._2Sa3_10="And if I do not take away the kingdom from the family of Saul and make David ruler over Israel and Judah from Dan as far as Beer-sheba!";
B._2Sa3_11="And so great was Ish-bosheth's fear of Abner that he was not able to say a word in answer.";
B._2Sa3_12="And Abner sent men to David at Hebron, saying, Make an agreement with me, and I will give you my support in getting all Israel on your side.";
B._2Sa3_13="And he said, It is well; I will make an agreement with you, but on one condition, which is, that when you come before me, Saul's daughter Michal is to come with you; till she comes you will not see my face.";
B._2Sa3_14="And David sent men to Saul's son Ish-bosheth, saying, Give me back Michal, my wife, whom I made mine for the price of the private parts of a hundred Philistines.";
B._2Sa3_15="So Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel, the son of Laish.";
B._2Sa3_16="And her husband went with her as far as Bahurim, weeping while he went. Then Abner said to him, Go back. And he went back.";
B._2Sa3_17="Then Abner had a talk with the chief men of Israel, saying, In the past it was your desire to make David your king: so now, do it:";
B._2Sa3_18="For the Lord has said of David, By the hand of my servant David I will make my people Israel safe from the Philistines, and from all who are against them.";
B._2Sa3_19="And Abner said the same things to Benjamin: and he went to David in Hebron to make clear to him what seemed good to Israel and to all the people of Benjamin.";
B._2Sa3_20="So Abner, with twenty men, came to Hebron, to David. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.";
B._2Sa3_21="And Abner said to David, Now I will go, and make all Israel come to my lord the king, so that they may make an agreement with you, and your kingdom may be as wide as your heart's desire. Then David sent Abner away and he went in peace.";
B._2Sa3_22="Now the servants of David and Joab had been out attacking a band of armed men, and they came back with a great store of goods taken in the fight: but Abner was no longer in Hebron with David, for he had sent him away and he had gone in peace.";
B._2Sa3_23="When Joab and his men came, news was given them that Abner, the son of Ner, had come to the king, who had let him go away again in peace.";
B._2Sa3_24="Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? when Abner came to you why did you send him away and let him go?";
B._2Sa3_25="Is it not clear to you that Abner, the son of Ner, came with deceit to get knowledge of your going out and your coming in and of all you are doing?";
B._2Sa3_26="And when Joab had come out from David, he sent men after Abner, and they overtook him at the water-spring of Sirah, and made him come back with them: but David had no knowledge of it.";
B._2Sa3_27="And when Abner was back in Hebron, Joab took him on one side by the doorway of the town to have a word with him quietly, and there he gave him a wound in the stomach, causing his death in payment for the death of his brother Asahel.";
B._2Sa3_28="And when David had word of it he said, May I and my kingdom be clear for ever in the eyes of the Lord from the blood of Abner, the son of Ner:";
B._2Sa3_29="May it come on the head of Joab and all his father's family: among the men of Joab's family may there ever be some who are diseased or lepers, or who do the work of women, or are put to the sword, or are wasted from need of food!";
B._2Sa3_30="So Joab and Abishai his brother put Abner to death, because he had put to death their brother Asahel in the fight at Gibeon.";
B._2Sa3_31="And David said to Joab and all the people who were with him, Go in grief and put haircloth about you, in sorrow for Abner. And King David went after the dead body.";
B._2Sa3_32="And they put Abner's body to rest in Hebron; and the king and all the people were weeping loudly by the resting-place of Abner's body.";
B._2Sa3_33="And the king made a song of grief for Abner and said, Was the death of Abner to be like the death of a foolish man?";
B._2Sa3_34="Your hands were free, your feet were not chained: like the downfall of a man before evil men, so was your fall. And the weeping of the people over him went on again.";
B._2Sa3_35="And the people came to make David take food, while it was still day, but David with an oath said, May God's punishment be on me if I take a taste of bread or any other thing till the sun has gone down!";
B._2Sa3_36="And all the people took note of it and were pleased: like everything the king did, it was pleasing to the people.";
B._2Sa3_37="So it was clear to Israel and to all the people on that day that the king was not responsible for the death of Abner, the son of Ner.";
B._2Sa3_38="And the king said to his servants, Do you not see that a chief and a great man has come to his end today in Israel?";
B._2Sa3_39="While I, though I am crowned king, have little strength, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are out of my control: may the Lord give to the evil-doer the reward of his evil-doing!";
B._2Sa4_1="And when Saul's son Ish-bosheth had news that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.";
B._2Sa4_2="And Saul's son had two men, captains of bands, one named Baanah and the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the tribe of Benjamin; (for Beeroth was at one time taken to be part of Benjamin:";
B._2Sa4_3="But the people of Beeroth had gone in flight to Gittaim, where they have been living to this day.)";
B._2Sa4_4="Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son whose feet were damaged. He was five years old when news of the death of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and the woman who took care of him took him up and went in flight: and while she was getting him away as quickly as she was able, he had a fall and his feet were damaged. His name was Mephibosheth.";
B._2Sa4_5="And Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, went out and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day, when he was resting in the middle of the day. Now the woman who kept the door was cleaning grain, and sleep overcame her.";
B._2Sa4_6="And Rechab and his brother Baanah got in without being seen.";
B._2Sa4_7="And when they came into the house, Ish-bosheth was stretched on his bed in his bedroom; and they made an attack on him and put him to death, and, cutting off his head, they took it with them and went by the road through the Arabah all night.";
B._2Sa4_8="And they took the head of Ish-bosheth to David in Hebron, and said to the king, Here is the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul your hater, who would have taken your life; the Lord has taken payment for the wrongs of my lord the king from Saul and his seed today.";
B._2Sa4_9="And David made answer to Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, By the living Lord, who has kept me safe from all my trouble,";
B._2Sa4_10="When one came to me with the news of Saul's death, in the belief that it would be good news, I took him and put him to death in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news:";
B._2Sa4_11="How much more, when evil men have put an upright person to death, in his house, sleeping on his bed, will I take payment from you for his blood, and have you cut off from the earth?";
B._2Sa4_12="And David gave orders to his young men and they put them to death, cutting off their hands and their feet and hanging them up by the side of the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and put it in its last resting-place with Abner's body in Hebron.";
B._2Sa5_1="Then all the tribes of Israel came to David in Hebron and said, Truly, we are your bone and your flesh.";
B._2Sa5_2="In the past when Saul was king over us, it was you who went at the head of Israel when they went out or came in: and the Lord said to you, You are to be the keeper of my people Israel and their ruler.";
B._2Sa5_3="So all the responsible men of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David made an agreement with them in Hebron before the Lord: and they put the holy oil on David and made him king over Israel.";
B._2Sa5_4="David was thirty years old when he became king, and he was king for forty years,";
B._2Sa5_5="Ruling over Judah in Hebron for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem, over all Israel and Judah, for thirty-three years.";
B._2Sa5_6="And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the people of the land: and they said to David, You will not come in here, but the blind and the feeble-footed will keep you out; for they said, David will not be able to come in here.";
B._2Sa5_7="But David took the strong place of Zion, which is the town of David.";
B._2Sa5_8="And that day David said, Whoever makes an attack on the Jebusites, let him go up by the water-pipe, and put to death all the blind and feeble-footed who are hated by David. And this is why they say, The blind and feeble-footed may not come into the house.";
B._2Sa5_9="So David took the strong tower for his living-place, naming it the town of David. And David took in hand the building of the town all round, starting from the Millo.";
B._2Sa5_10="And David became greater and greater; for the Lord, the God of armies, was with him.";
B._2Sa5_11="And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent men to David, with cedar-trees and woodworkers and stoneworkers: and they made David a house.";
B._2Sa5_12="And David saw that the Lord had made his position safe as king over Israel, and that he had made his kingdom great because of his people Israel.";
B._2Sa5_13="And David took more women and wives in Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron: and he had more sons and daughters.";
B._2Sa5_14="These are the names of those whose birth took place in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon";
B._2Sa5_15="And Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and Japhia";
B._2Sa5_16="And Elishama and Eliada and Eliphelet.";
B._2Sa5_17="And when the Philistines had news that David had been made king over Israel, they all went up in search of David; and David, hearing of it, went down to the strong place.";
B._2Sa5_18="And when the Philistines came, they went in every direction in the valley of Rephaim.";
B._2Sa5_19="And David, desiring directions from the Lord, said, Am I to go up against the Philistines? will you give them up into my hands? And the Lord said, Go up, for I will certainly give up the Philistines into your hands.";
B._2Sa5_20="And David went to Baal-perazim, and overcame them there; and he said, The Lord has let the forces fighting against me be broken before me as a wall is broken by rushing waters. So that place was named Baal-perazim.";
B._2Sa5_21="And the Philistines, when they went in flight, did not take their images with them, and David and his men took them away.";
B._2Sa5_22="And the Philistines came up again, and went in every direction in the valley of Rephaim.";
B._2Sa5_23="And when David went for directions to the Lord, he said, You are not to go up against them in front; but make a circle round them from the back and come on them opposite the spice-trees.";
B._2Sa5_24="Then at the sound of footsteps in the tops of the trees, go forward quickly, for the Lord has gone out before you to overcome the army of the Philistines.";
B._2Sa5_25="And David did as the Lord had said; and he overcame the Philistines, attacking them from Gibeon to near Gezer.";
B._2Sa6_1="And David got together all the fighting-men of Israel to the number of thirty thousand;";
B._2Sa6_2="And David, and all the people who were with him, went to Baal of Judah to get the ark of God, over which the holy name is named, the name of the Lord of armies, whose place is between the winged ones.";
B._2Sa6_3="And they put the ark of God on a new cart and took it out of the house of Abinadab which was on the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were the drivers of the cart.";
B._2Sa6_4="And Uzzah went by the side of the ark, while Ahio went before it.";
B._2Sa6_5="And David and all the men of Israel made melody before the Lord with all their power, with songs and with corded instruments and instruments of brass.";
B._2Sa6_6="And when they came to Nacon's grain-floor, Uzzah put his hand on the ark of God to keep it safe in its place, for the oxen were out of control.";
B._2Sa6_7="And the wrath of the Lord, burning against Uzzah, sent destruction on him because he had put his hand on the ark, and death came to him there by the ark of God.";
B._2Sa6_8="And David was angry because of the Lord's outburst of wrath against Uzzah: and he gave that place the name Perez-uzzah, which is its name to this day.";
B._2Sa6_9="And such was David's fear of the Lord that day, that he said, How may I let the ark of God come to me?";
B._2Sa6_10="So David did not let the ark of the Lord come back to him to the town of David: but had it turned away and put into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.";
B._2Sa6_11="And the ark of the Lord was in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months: and the Lord sent a blessing on Obed-edom and all his family.";
B._2Sa6_12="And they said to King David, The blessing of the Lord is on the family of Obed-edom and on all he has, because of the ark of God. And David went and took the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the town of David with joy.";
B._2Sa6_13="And when those who were lifting the ark of the Lord had gone six steps, he made an offering of an ox and a fat young beast.";
B._2Sa6_14="And David, clothed in a linen ephod, was dancing before the Lord with all his strength.";
B._2Sa6_15="So David and all the men of Israel took up the ark of the Lord with cries of joy and sounding of horns.";
B._2Sa6_16="And when the ark of the Lord came into the town of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looking out of the window, saw King David dancing and jumping before the Lord; and to her mind he seemed foolish.";
B._2Sa6_17="And they took in the ark of the Lord, and put it in its place inside the tent which David had put up for it: and David made burned offerings and peace-offerings to the Lord.";
B._2Sa6_18="And after David had made the burned offerings and the peace-offerings, he gave the people a blessing in the name of the Lord of armies.";
B._2Sa6_19="And he gave to every man and woman among all the people, among all the masses of Israel, a cake of bread and a measure of wine and a cake of dry grapes. Then all the people went away, every man to his house.";
B._2Sa6_20="Then David came back to give a blessing to his family. And Michal, Saul's daughter, came out to him and said, How full of glory was the king of Israel today, who let himself be seen uncovered by his servant-girls like a foolish person uncovering himself without shame!";
B._2Sa6_21="And David said to Michal, I was dancing before the Lord, who put me over your father and all his sons, to make me a ruler over the people of the Lord, over his people Israel: and I will go on playing before the Lord;";
B._2Sa6_22="And I will do even worse than this, and make myself even lower in your eyes: but the servant-girls of whom you were talking will give me honour.";
B._2Sa6_23="And Michal, Saul's daughter, had no child till the day of her death.";
B._2Sa7_1="Now when the king was living in his house, and the Lord had given him rest from war on every side;";
B._2Sa7_2="The king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God is housed inside the curtains of a tent.";
B._2Sa7_3="And Nathan said to the king, Go and do whatever is in your heart; for the Lord is with you.";
B._2Sa7_4="Now that night the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying,";
B._2Sa7_5="Go and say to my servant David, The Lord says, Are you to be the builder of a house, a living-place for me?";
B._2Sa7_6="For from the day when I took the children of Israel up out of Egypt till this day, I have had no house, but have gone from place to place in a tent.";
B._2Sa7_7="In all the places where I went with all the children of Israel, did I ever say to any of the judges of Israel, to whom I gave the care of my people Israel, Why have you not made me a house of cedar?";
B._2Sa7_8="Then say these words to my servant David, The Lord of armies says, I took you from the fields, from keeping the sheep, so that you might be a ruler over my people, over my people Israel:";
B._2Sa7_9="And I have been with you wherever you went, cutting off before you all those who were against you; and I will make your name great, like the name of the greatest ones of the earth.";
B._2Sa7_10="And I will make a resting-place for my people Israel, planting them there, so that they may be living in the place which is theirs, and never again be moved; and never again will they be troubled by evil men as they were at the first,";
B._2Sa7_11="From the time when I put judges over my people Israel; and I will give you peace from all who are against you. And the Lord says to you that he will make you the head of a line of kings.";
B._2Sa7_12="And when the time comes for you to go to rest with your fathers, I will put in your place your seed after you, the offspring of your body, and I will make his kingdom strong.";
B._2Sa7_13="He will be the builder of a house for my name, and I will make the seat of his authority certain for ever.";
B._2Sa7_14="I will be to him a father and he will be to me a son: if he does wrong, I will give him punishment with the rod of men and with the blows of the children of men;";
B._2Sa7_15="But my mercy will not be taken away from him, as I took it from him who was before you.";
B._2Sa7_16="And your family and your kingdom will keep their place before me for ever: the seat of your authority will never be overturned.";
B._2Sa7_17="So Nathan gave David an account of all these words and this vision.";
B._2Sa7_18="Then David the king went in and took his seat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my family, that you have been my guide till now?";
B._2Sa7_19="And this was only a small thing to you, O Lord God; but your words have even been about the far-off future of your servant's family, O Lord God!";
B._2Sa7_20="What more may David say to you? for you have knowledge of your servant, O Lord God.";
B._2Sa7_21="Because of your word and from your heart, you have done all this great work, and let your servant see it.";
B._2Sa7_22="Truly you are great, O Lord God: there is no one like you and no other God but you, as is clear from everything which has come to our ears.";
B._2Sa7_23="And what other nation in the earth, like your people Israel, did a god go out to take for himself, to be his people, and to make a name for himself, and to do great and strange things for them, driving out a nation and its gods from before his people?";
B._2Sa7_24="But you took and made strong for yourself your people Israel, to be your people for ever; and you, Lord, became their God.";
B._2Sa7_25="And now, O Lord God, may the word which you have said about your servant and about his family, be made certain for ever, and may you do as you have said!";
B._2Sa7_26="And let your name be made great for ever, and let men say, The Lord of armies is God over Israel: and let the family of David your servant be made strong before you!";
B._2Sa7_27="For you, O Lord of armies, the God of Israel, have clearly said to your servant, I will make you the head of a family of kings: and so it has come into your servant's heart to make this prayer to you.";
B._2Sa7_28="And now, O Lord God, you are God and your words are true and you have said you will give your servant this good thing;";
B._2Sa7_29="So may it be your pleasure to give your blessing to the family of your servant, so that it may go on for ever before you: (for you, O Lord God, have said it,) and may your blessing be on your servant's family line for ever!";
B._2Sa8_1="And it came about after this that David made an attack on the Philistines and overcame them; and David took the authority of the mother-town from the hands of the Philistines.";
B._2Sa8_2="And he overcame the Moabites, and he had them measured with a line when they were stretched out on the earth; marking out two lines for death and one full line for life. So the Moabites became servants to David and gave him offerings.";
B._2Sa8_3="And David overcame Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, when he went to make his power seen by the River.";
B._2Sa8_4="And David took from him one thousand, seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen: and David had the leg-muscles of the horses cut, only keeping enough of them for a hundred war-carriages.";
B._2Sa8_5="And when the Aramaeans of Damascus came to the help of Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David put to the sword twenty-two thousand of the Aramaeans.";
B._2Sa8_6="And David put armed forces in Aram of Damascus: and the Aramaeans became servants to David and gave him offerings. And the Lord made David overcome wherever he went.";
B._2Sa8_7="And David took their gold body-covers from the servants of Hadadezer and took them to Jerusalem.";
B._2Sa8_8="And from Tebah and Berothai, towns of Hadadezer, King David took a great store of brass.";
B._2Sa8_9="And when Tou, king of Hamath, had news that David had overcome all the army of Hadadezer,";
B._2Sa8_10="He sent his son Hadoram to David, with words of peace and blessing, because he had overcome Hadadezer in the fight, for Hadadezer had wars with Tou; and Hadoram took with him vessels of silver and gold and brass:";
B._2Sa8_11="These King David made holy to the Lord, together with the silver and gold which he had taken from the nations he had overcome--";
B._2Sa8_12="The nations of Edom and Moab, and the children of Ammon and the Philistines and the Amalekites and the goods he had taken from Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah.";
B._2Sa8_13="And David got great honour for himself, when he came back, by the destruction of Edom in the valley of Salt, to the number of eighteen thousand men.";
B._2Sa8_14="And he put armed forces in Edom; all through Edom he had armed forces stationed, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the Lord made David overcome wherever he went.";
B._2Sa8_15="And David was king over all Israel, judging and giving right decisions for all his people.";
B._2Sa8_16="And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the army; and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was keeper of the records;";
B._2Sa8_17="And Zadok and Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, were priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;";
B._2Sa8_18="And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were priests.";
B._2Sa9_1="And David said, Is there still anyone of Saul's family living, so that I may be a friend to him, because of Jonathan?";
B._2Sa9_2="Now there was of Saul's people a servant named Ziba, and they sent him to David; and the king said to him, Are you Ziba? And he said, I am.";
B._2Sa9_3="And the king said, Is there anyone of Saul's family still living, to whom I may be a friend in God's name? And Ziba said, There is a son of Jonathan, whose feet are damaged.";
B._2Sa9_4="And the king said to him, Where is he? And Ziba said to the king, He is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.";
B._2Sa9_5="Then King David sent, and had him taken from Lo-debar, from the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel.";
B._2Sa9_6="And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, came to David, and falling down on his face, gave him honour. And David said, Mephibosheth. And answering he said, Your servant is here.";
B._2Sa9_7="And David said to him, Have no fear: for truly I will be good to you, because of your father Jonathan, and I will give back to you all the land which was Saul's; and you will have a place at my table at all times.";
B._2Sa9_8="And he went down on his face before the king, and said, What is your servant, for you to take note of a dead dog such as I am?";
B._2Sa9_9="Then the king sent for Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, All the property of Saul and of his family I have given to your master's son.";
B._2Sa9_10="And you and your sons and your servants are to take care of the land for him, and get in the fruit of it, so that your master's son may have food: but Mephibosheth, your master's son, will have a place at my table at all times. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.";
B._2Sa9_11="Then Ziba said to the king, Every order which you have given to your servant will be done. As for Mephibosheth, he had a place at David's table, like one of the king's sons.";
B._2Sa9_12="And Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica. And all the people living in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.";
B._2Sa9_13="So Mephibosheth went on living in Jerusalem; for he took all his meals at the king's table; and he had not the use of his feet.";
B._2Sa10_1="Now after this, death came to the king of the children of Ammon, and Hanun, his son, became king in his place.";
B._2Sa10_2="And David said, I will be a friend to Hanun, the son of Nahash, as his father was a friend to me. So David sent his servants, to give him words of comfort on account of his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.";
