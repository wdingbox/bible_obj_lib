B._Num16_34="And all Israel round about them went in flight at their cry, For fear, said they, that we go down into the heart of the earth.";
B._Num16_35="Then fire came out from the Lord, burning up the two hundred and fifty men who were offering the perfume.";
B._Num16_36="And the Lord said to Moses,";
B._Num16_37="Say to Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, that he is to take out of the flames the vessels with the perfumes in them, turning the fire out of them, for they are holy;";
B._Num16_38="And let the vessels of those men, who with their lives have made payment for their sin, be hammered out into plates as a cover for the altar; for they have been offered before the Lord and are holy; so that they may be a sign to the children of Israel.";
B._Num16_39="So Eleazar the priest took the brass vessels which had been offered by those who were burned up, and they were hammered out to make a cover for the altar:";
B._Num16_40="To be a sign, kept in memory for ever by the children of Israel, that no man who is not of the seed of Aaron has the right of burning spices before the Lord, so that he may not be like Korah and his band: as the Lord said to him by the mouth of Moses.";
B._Num16_41="But on the day after, all the children of Israel made an outcry against Moses and against Aaron, saying, You have put to death the Lord's people.";
B._Num16_42="Now when the people had come together against Moses and Aaron, looking in the direction of the Tent of meeting, they saw the cloud covering it, and the glory of the Lord came before their eyes.";

B._Num16_45="Come out from among this people, so that I may send sudden destruction on them. And they went down on their faces.";
B._Num16_46="And Moses said to Aaron, Take your vessel and put in it fire from the altar, and sweet spices, and take it quickly into the meeting of the people, and make them free from sin: for wrath has gone out from the Lord, and the disease is starting.";
B._Num16_47="And at the words of Moses, Aaron took his vessel, and went running among the people; and even then the disease had made a start among them; and he put spices in his vessel to take away the sin of the people.";

B._Num16_49="Now fourteen thousand, seven hundred deaths were caused by that disease, in addition to those who came to their end because of what Korah had done.";
B._Num16_50="Then Aaron went back to Moses to the door of the Tent of meeting: and the disease came to a stop.";
B._Num17_1="And the Lord said to Moses,";
B._Num17_2="Say to the children of Israel that they are to give you rods, one for every family, for every chief, the head of his father's house, making twelve rods; let every man's name be placed on his rod.";
B._Num17_3="And let Aaron's name be placed on the rod of Levi: for there is to be one rod for the head of every family.";

B._Num17_9="Then Moses took out all the rods from before the Lord, and gave them back to the children of Israel: and they saw them, and every man took his rod.";
B._Num17_10="And the Lord said to Moses, Put Aaron's rod back in front of the ark of witness, to be kept for a sign against this false-hearted people, so that you may put a stop to their outcries against me, and death may not overtake them.";
B._Num17_11="This Moses did: as the Lord gave orders, so he did.";
B._Num17_12="And the children of Israel said to Moses, Truly, destruction has come on us; an evil fate has overtaken us all.";

B._Num21_13="From there they went on and put up their tents on the other side of the Arnon, which is on the waste land at the edge of the land of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the line of division between Moab and the Amorites:";
