B._Zep1_14="The great day of the Lord is near, it is near and coming very quickly; the bitter day of the Lord is near, coming on more quickly than a man of war.";
B._Zep1_15="That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and sorrow, a day of wasting and destruction, a day of dark night and deep shade, a day of cloud and thick dark.";

B._Zec3_3="Now Joshua was clothed in unclean robes, and he was in his place before the angel.";
B._Zec3_4="And he made answer and said to those who were there before him, Take the unclean robes off him, and let him be clothed in clean robes;";
B._Zec3_5="And let them put a clean head-dress on his head. So they put a clean head-dress on his head, clothing him with clean robes: and to him he said, See, I have taken your sin away from you.";
B._Zec3_6="And the angel of the Lord made a statement to Joshua, and said,";
B._Zec3_7="These are the words of the Lord of armies: If you will go in my ways and keep what I have put in your care, then you will be judge over my Temple and have the care of my house, and I will give you the right to come in among those who are there.";

B._Zec3_10="In that day, says the Lord of armies, you will be one another's guests under the vine and under the fig-tree.";
B._Zec4_1="And the angel who was talking to me came again, awaking me as a man out of his sleep.";

B._Zec4_3="And two olive-trees by it, one on the right side of the cup and one on the left.";
B._Zec4_4="And I made answer and said to the angel who was talking to me, What are these, my lord?";
B._Zec4_5="Then the angel who was talking to me, answering me, said, Have you no knowledge of what these are? And I said, No, my lord.";
B._Zec4_6="This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by force or by power, but by my spirit, says the Lord of armies.";
B._Zec4_7="Who are you, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel you will become level: and he will let all see the headstone, with cries of Grace, grace, to it.";
B._Zec4_8="Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Zec4_9="The hands of Zerubbabel have put the base of this house in place, and his hands will make it complete; and it will be clear to you that the Lord of armies has sent me to you.";
B._Zec4_10="For who has had a poor opinion of the day of small things? for they will be glad when they see the weighted measuring-line in the hand of Zerubbabel. Then he said in answer to me, These seven lights are the eyes of the Lord which go quickly up and down through all the earth.";
B._Zec4_11="And I made answer and said to him, What are these two olive-trees on the right side of the light-support and on the left?";
B._Zec4_12="And answering a second time, I said to him, What are these two olive branches, through whose gold pipes the oil is drained out?";
B._Zec4_13="And he said in answer to me, Have you no knowledge what these are? And I said, No, my lord.";
B._Zec4_14="And he said, These are the two sons of oil, whose place is by the Lord of all the earth.";
B._Zec5_1="Then again lifting up my eyes I saw a roll in flight through the air.";
B._Zec5_2="And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, A roll going through the air; it is twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide.";
B._Zec5_3="Then he said to me, This is the curse which goes out over the face of all the land: for long enough has every thief gone without punishment, and long enough has every taker of false oaths gone without punishment.";
B._Zec5_4="And I will send it out, says the Lord of armies, and it will go into the house of the thief and into the house of him who takes a false oath by my name: and it will be in his house, causing its complete destruction, with its woodwork and its stones.";
