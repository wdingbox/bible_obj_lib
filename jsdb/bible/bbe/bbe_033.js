B._Deu29_9="So keep the words of this agreement and do them, so that it may be well for you in everything you do.";
B._Deu29_10="You have come here today, all of you, before the Lord your God; the heads of your tribes, the overseers, and those who are in authority over you, with all the men of Israel,";
B._Deu29_11="And your little ones, your wives, and the men of other lands who are with you in your tents, down to the wood-cutter and the servant who gets water for you:";
B._Deu29_12="With the purpose of taking part in the agreement of the Lord your God, and his oath which he makes with you today:";
B._Deu29_13="And so that he may make you his people today, and be your God, as he has said to you, and as he made an oath to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.";
B._Deu29_14="And not with you only do I make this agreement and this oath;";
B._Deu29_15="But with everyone who is here with us today before the Lord our God, as well as with those who are not here:";
B._Deu29_16="(For you have in mind how we were living in the land of Egypt; and how we came through all the nations which were on your way;";
B._Deu29_17="And you have seen their disgusting doings, and the images of wood and stone and silver and gold which were among them:)";
B._Deu29_18="So that there may not be among you any man or woman or family or tribe whose heart is turned away from the Lord our God today, to go after other gods and give them worship; or any root among you whose fruit is poison and bitter sorrow;";
B._Deu29_19="If such a man, hearing the words of this oath, takes comfort in the thought that he will have peace even if he goes on in the pride of his heart, taking whatever chance may give him:";
B._Deu29_20="The Lord will have no mercy on him, but the wrath of the Lord will be burning against that man, and all the curses recorded in this book will be waiting for him, and the Lord will take away his name completely from the earth.";
B._Deu29_21="He will be marked out by the Lord, from all the tribes of Israel, for an evil fate, in keeping with all the curses of the agreement recorded in this book of the law.";
B._Deu29_22="And future generations, your children coming after you, and travellers from far countries, will say, when they see the punishments of that land and the diseases which the Lord has sent on it;";
B._Deu29_23="And that all the land is a salt and smoking waste, not planted or giving fruit or clothed with grass, but wasted like Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, on which the Lord sent destruction in the heat of his wrath:";
B._Deu29_24="Truly all the nations will say, Why has the Lord done so to this land? what is the reason for this great and burning wrath?";
B._Deu29_25="Then men will say, Because they gave up the agreement of the Lord, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he took them out of the land of Egypt:";
B._Deu29_26="And they went after other gods and gave them worship, gods who were strange to them, and whom he had not given them:";
B._Deu29_27="And so the wrath of the Lord was moved against this land, to send on it all the curse recorded in this book:";
B._Deu29_28="Rooting them out of their land, in the heat of his wrath and passion, and driving them out into another land, as at this day.";
B._Deu29_29="The secret things are the Lord our God's: but the things which have been made clear are ours and our children's for ever, so that we may do all the words of this law.";
B._Deu30_1="Now when all these things have come on you, the blessing and the curse which I have put before you, if the thought of them comes back to your minds, when you are living among the nations where the Lord your God has sent you,";
B._Deu30_2="And your hearts are turned again to the Lord your God, and you give ear to his word which I give you today, you and your children, with all your heart and with all your soul:";
B._Deu30_3="Then the Lord will have pity on you, changing your fate, and taking you back again from among all the nations where you have been forced to go.";
B._Deu30_4="Even if those who have been forced out are living in the farthest part of heaven, the Lord your God will go in search of you, and take you back;";
B._Deu30_5="Placing you again in the land of your fathers as your heritage; and he will do you good, increasing you till you are more in number than your fathers were.";
B._Deu30_6="And the Lord your God will give to you and to your seed a circumcision of the heart, so that, loving him with all your heart and all your soul, you may have life.";
B._Deu30_7="And the Lord your God will put all these curses on those who are against you, and on your haters who put a cruel yoke on you.";
B._Deu30_8="And you will again give ear to the voice of the Lord, and do all his orders which I have given you today.";
B._Deu30_9="And the Lord your God will make you fertile in all good things, blessing the work of your hands, and the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your cattle, and the fruit of your land: for the Lord will have joy in you, as he had in your fathers:";
B._Deu30_10="If you give ear to the voice of the Lord your God, keeping his orders and his laws which are recorded in this book of the law, and turning to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.";
B._Deu30_11="For these orders which I have given you today are not strange and secret, and are not far away.";
B._Deu30_12="They are not in heaven, for you to say, Who will go up to heaven for us and give us knowledge of them so that we may do them?";
B._Deu30_13="And they are not across the sea, for you to say, Who will go over the sea for us and give us news of them so that we may do them?";
B._Deu30_14="But the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may do it.";
B._Deu30_15="See, I have put before you today, life and good, and death and evil;";
B._Deu30_16="In giving you orders today to have love for the Lord your God, to go in his ways and keep his laws and his orders and his decisions, so that you may have life and be increased, and that the blessing of the Lord your God may be with you in the land where you are going, the land of your heritage.";
B._Deu30_17="But if your heart is turned away and your ear is shut, and you go after those who would make you servants and worshippers of other gods:";
B._Deu30_18="I give witness against you this day that destruction will certainly be your fate, and your days will be cut short in the land where you are going, the land of your heritage on the other side of Jordan.";
B._Deu30_19="Let heaven and earth be my witnesses against you this day that I have put before you life and death, a blessing and a curse: so take life for yourselves and for your seed:";
B._Deu30_20="In loving the Lord your God, hearing his voice and being true to him: for he is your life and by him will your days be long: so that you may go on living in the land which the Lord gave by an oath to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.";
B._Deu31_1="So Moses said all these things to Israel.";
B._Deu31_2="Then he said to them, I am now a hundred and twenty years old; I am no longer able to go out and come in: and the Lord has said to me, You are not to go over Jordan.";
B._Deu31_3="The Lord your God, he will go over before you; he will send destruction on all those nations, and you will take their land as your heritage: and Joshua will go over at your head as the Lord has said.";
B._Deu31_4="The Lord will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, whom he put to destruction.";
B._Deu31_5="The Lord will give them up into your hands, and you are to do to them as I have given you orders.";
B._Deu31_6="Be strong and take heart, and have no fear of them: for it is the Lord your God who is going with you; he will not take away his help from you.";
B._Deu31_7="Then Moses sent for Joshua, and before the eyes of all Israel said to him, Be strong and take heart: for you are to go with this people into the land which the Lord, by his oath to their fathers, has given them; by your help they will take it for their heritage.";
B._Deu31_8="It is the Lord who goes before you; he will be with you, he will not take away his help from you or give you up: so have no fear.";
B._Deu31_9="Then Moses put all this law in writing, and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who take up the ark of the Lord's agreement, and to all the responsible men of Israel.";
B._Deu31_10="And Moses said to them, At the end of every seven years, at the time fixed for the ending of debts, at the feast of tents,";
B._Deu31_11="When all Israel has come before the Lord your God in the place named by him, let a reading be given of this law in the hearing of all Israel.";
B._Deu31_12="Make all the people come together, men and women and children, and anyone from another country who is with you, so that hearing they may become wise in the fear of the Lord your God, and take care to do all the words of this law;";
B._Deu31_13="And so that your children, to whom it is new, may give ear and be trained in the fear of the Lord your God, while you are living in the land which you are going over Jordan to take for your heritage.";
B._Deu31_14="At that time the Lord said to Moses, The day of your death is near: send for Joshua, and come to the Tent of meeting so that I may give him his orders. So Moses and Joshua went to the Tent of meeting.";
B._Deu31_15="And the Lord was seen in the Tent in a pillar of cloud resting by the door of the Tent.";
B._Deu31_16="And the Lord said to Moses, Now you are going to rest with your fathers; and this people will be false to me, uniting themselves to the strange gods of the land where they are going; they will be turned away from me and will not keep the agreement I have made with them.";
B._Deu31_17="In that day my wrath will be moved against them, and I will be turned away from them, veiling my face from them, and destruction will overtake them, and unnumbered evils and troubles will come on them; so that in that day they will say, Have not these evils come on us because our God is not with us?";
B._Deu31_18="Truly, my face will be turned away from them in that day, because of all the evil they have done in going after other gods.";
B._Deu31_19="Make then this song for yourselves, teaching it to the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, so that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.";
B._Deu31_20="For when I have taken them into the land named in my oath to their fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey, and they have made themselves full of food and are fat, then they will be turned to other gods and will give them worship, no longer honouring me or keeping my agreement.";
B._Deu31_21="Then when evils and troubles without number have overtaken them, this song will be a witness to them, for the words of it will be clear in the memories of their children: for I see the thoughts which are moving in their hearts even now, before I have taken them into the land of my oath.";
B._Deu31_22="So that same day Moses made this song, teaching it to the children of Israel.";
B._Deu31_23="Then he gave orders to Joshua, the son of Nun, saying to him, Be strong and take heart: for you are to go at the head of the children of Israel into the land which I made an oath to give them; and I will be with you.";
B._Deu31_24="Now after writing all the words of this law in a book till the record of them was complete,";
B._Deu31_25="Moses said to the Levites who were responsible for taking up the ark of the Lord's agreement,";
B._Deu31_26="Take this book of the law and put it by the ark of the Lord's agreement, so that it may be a witness against you.";
B._Deu31_27="For I have knowledge of your hard and uncontrolled hearts: even now, while I am still living, you will not be ruled by the Lord; how much less after my death?";
B._Deu31_28="Get together before me all those who are in authority in your tribes, and your overseers, so that I may say these things in their hearing, and make heaven and earth my witnesses against them.";
B._Deu31_29="For I am certain that after my death you will give yourselves up to sin, wandering from the way which I have given you; and evil will overtake you in the end, because you will do evil in the eyes of the Lord, moving him to wrath by the work of your hands.";
B._Deu31_30="Then in the hearing of all the meeting of Israel, Moses said the words of this song, to the end.";
B._Deu32_1="Give ear, O heavens, to my voice; let the earth take note of the words of my mouth:";
B._Deu32_2="My teaching is dropping like rain, coming down like dew on the fields; like rain on the young grass and showers on the garden plants:";
B._Deu32_3="For I will give honour to the name of the Lord: let our God be named great.";
B._Deu32_4="He is the Rock, complete is his work; for all his ways are righteousness: a God without evil who keeps faith, true and upright is he.";
B._Deu32_5="They have become false, they are not his children, the mark of sin is on them; they are an evil and hard-hearted generation.";
B._Deu32_6="Is this your answer to the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? Is he not your father who has given you life? He has made you and given you your place.";
B._Deu32_7="Keep in mind the days of the past, give thought to the years of generations gone by: go to your father and he will make it clear to you, to the old men and they will give you the story.";
B._Deu32_8="When the Most High gave the nations their heritage, separating into groups the children of men, he had the limits of the peoples marked out, keeping in mind the number of the children of Israel.";
B._Deu32_9="For the Lord's wealth is his people; Jacob is the land of his heritage.";
B._Deu32_10="He came to him in the waste land, in the unpeopled waste of sand: putting his arms round him and caring for him, he kept him as the light of his eye.";
B._Deu32_11="As an eagle, teaching her young to make their flight, with her wings outstretched over them, takes them up on her strong feathers:";
B._Deu32_12="So the Lord only was his guide, no other god was with him.";
B._Deu32_13="He put him on the high places of the earth, his food was the increase of the field; honey he gave him out of the rock and oil out of the hard rock;";
B._Deu32_14="Butter from his cows and milk from his sheep, with fat of lambs and sheep of Bashan, and goats, and the heart of the grain; and for your drink, wine from the blood of the grape.";
B._Deu32_15="But Jeshurun became fat and would not be controlled: you have become fat, you are thick and full of food: then he was untrue to the God who made him, giving no honour to the Rock of his salvation.";
B._Deu32_16="The honour which was his they gave to strange gods; by their disgusting ways he was moved to wrath.";
B._Deu32_17="They made offerings to evil spirits which were not God, to gods who were strange to them, which had newly come up, not feared by your fathers.";
B._Deu32_18="You have no thought for the Rock, your father, you have no memory of the God who gave you birth.";
B._Deu32_19="And the Lord saw with disgust the evil-doing of his sons and daughters.";
B._Deu32_20="And he said, My face will be veiled from them, I will see what their end will be: for they are an uncontrolled generation, children in whom is no faith.";
B._Deu32_21="They have given my honour to that which is not God, moving me to wrath with their false worship: I will give their honour to those who are not a people, moving them to wrath by a foolish nation,";
B._Deu32_22="For my wrath is a flaming fire, burning to the deep parts of the underworld, burning up the earth with her increase, and firing the deep roots of the mountains.";
B._Deu32_23="I will send a rain of troubles on them, my arrows will be showered on them.";
B._Deu32_24="They will be wasted from need of food, and overcome by burning heat and bitter destruction; and the teeth of beasts I will send on them, with the poison of the worms of the dust.";
B._Deu32_25="Outside they will be cut off by the sword, and in the inner rooms by fear; death will take the young man and the virgin, the baby at the breast and the grey-haired man.";
B._Deu32_26="I said I would send them wandering far away, I would make all memory of them go from the minds of men:";
B._Deu32_27="But for the fear that their haters, uplifted in their pride, might say, Our hand is strong, the Lord has not done all this.";
B._Deu32_28="For they are a nation without wisdom; there is no sense in them.";
B._Deu32_29="If only they were wise, if only this was clear to them, and they would give thought to their future!";
B._Deu32_30="How would it be possible for one to overcome a thousand, and two to send ten thousand in flight, if their rock had not let them go, if the Lord had not given them up?";
B._Deu32_31="For their rock is not like our Rock, even our haters themselves being judges.";
B._Deu32_32="For their vine is the vine of Sodom, from the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are the grapes of evil, and the berries are bitter:";
B._Deu32_33="Their wine is the poison of dragons, the cruel poison of snakes.";
B._Deu32_34="Is not this among my secrets, kept safe in my store-house?";
B._Deu32_35="Punishment is mine and reward, at the time of the slipping of their feet: for the day of their downfall is near, sudden will be their fate.";
B._Deu32_36="For the Lord will be judge of his people, he will have pity for his servants; when he sees that their power is gone, there is no one, shut up or free.";
B._Deu32_37="And he will say, Where are their gods, the rock in which they put their faith?";
B._Deu32_38="Who took the fat of their offerings, and the wine of their drink offering? Let them now come to your help, let them be your salvation.";
B._Deu32_39="See now, I myself am he; there is no other god but me: giver of death and life, wounding and making well: and no one has power to make you free from my hand.";
B._Deu32_40="For lifting up my hand to heaven I say, By my unending life,";
B._Deu32_41="If I make sharp my shining sword, and my hand is outstretched for judging, I will give punishment to those who are against me, and their right reward to my haters.";
B._Deu32_42="I will make my arrows red with blood, my sword will be feasting on flesh, with the blood of the dead and the prisoners, of the long-haired heads of my haters.";
B._Deu32_43="Be glad, O you his people, over the nations; for he will take payment for the blood of his servants, and will give punishment to his haters, and take away the sin of his land, for his people.";
B._Deu32_44="So Moses said all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Hoshea, the son of Nun.";
B._Deu32_45="And after saying all this to the people,";
B._Deu32_46="Moses said to them, Let the words which I have said to you today go deep into your hearts, and give orders to your children to do every word of this law.";
B._Deu32_47="And this is no small thing for you, but it is your life, and through this you may make your days long in the land which you are going over Jordan to take for your heritage.";
B._Deu32_48="That same day the Lord said to Moses,";
B._Deu32_49="Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo in the land of Moab opposite Jericho; there you may see the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel for their heritage:";
B._Deu32_50="And let death come to you on the mountain where you are going, and be put to rest with your people; as death came to Aaron, your brother, on Mount Hor, where he was put to rest with his people:";
B._Deu32_51="Because of your sin against me before the children of Israel at the waters of Meribath Kadesh in the waste land of Zin; because you did not keep my name holy among the children of Israel.";
B._Deu32_52="So you will see the land before you, but you will not go into the land which I am giving to the children of Israel.";
B._Deu33_1="Now this is the blessing which Moses, the man of God, gave to the children of Israel before his death.";
B._Deu33_2="He said, The Lord came from Sinai, dawning on them from Seir; shining out from Mount Paran, coming from Meribath Kadesh: from his right hand went flames of fire: his wrath made waste the peoples.";
B._Deu33_3="All his holy ones are at his hand; they go at his feet; they are lifted up on his wings.";
B._Deu33_4="Moses gave us a law, a heritage for the people of Jacob.";
B._Deu33_5="And there was a king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel came together.";
B._Deu33_6="Let life not death be Reuben's, let not the number of his men be small.";
B._Deu33_7="And this is the blessing of Judah: he said, Give ear, O Lord, to the voice of Judah and make him one with his people: let your hands take up his cause, and be his help against his attackers.";
B._Deu33_8="And of Levi he said, Give your Thummim to Levi and let the Urim be with your loved one, whom you put to the test at Massah, with whom you were angry at the waters of Meribah;";
B._Deu33_9="Who said of his father, Who is he? and of his mother, I have not seen her; he kept himself separate from his brothers and had no knowledge of his children: for they have given ear to your word and kept your agreement.";
B._Deu33_10="They will be the teachers of your decisions to Jacob and of your law to Israel: the burning of perfumes before you will be their right, and the ordering of burned offerings on your altar.";
B._Deu33_11="Let your blessing, O Lord, be on his substance, may the work of his hands be pleasing to you: may those who take up arms against him and all who have hate for him, be wounded through the heart, never to be lifted up again.";
B._Deu33_12="And of Benjamin he said, Benjamin is the loved one of the Lord, he will be kept safe at all times; he will be covered by the Most High, resting between his arms.";
B._Deu33_13="And of Joseph he said, Let the blessing of the Lord be on his land; for the good things of heaven on high, and the deep waters flowing under the earth,";
B._Deu33_14="And the good things of the fruits of the sun, and the good things of the growth of the moons,";
B._Deu33_15="And the chief things of the oldest mountains, and the good things of the eternal hills,";
B._Deu33_16="The good things of the earth and all its wealth, the good pleasure of him who was seen in the burning tree: may they come on the head of Joseph, on the head of him who was prince among his brothers.";
B._Deu33_17="He is a young ox, glory is his; his horns are the horns of the mountain ox, with which all peoples will be wounded, even to the ends of the earth: they are the ten thousands of Ephraim and the thousands of Manasseh.";
B._Deu33_18="And of Zebulun he said, Be glad, Zebulun, in your going out; and, Issachar, in your tents.";
B._Deu33_19="They will send out the word for the people to come to the mountain, taking there the offerings of righteousness: for the store of the seas will be theirs, and the secret wealth of the sand.";
B._Deu33_20="Of Gad he said, A blessing be on him who makes wide the limits of Gad: he takes his rest like a she-lion, taking for himself the arm and the crown of the head.";
B._Deu33_21="He kept for himself the first part, for his was the ruler's right: he put in force the righteousness of the Lord, and his decisions for Israel.";
B._Deu33_22="And of Dan he said, Dan is a young lion, springing out from Bashan.";
B._Deu33_23="And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, made glad with grace and full of the blessing of the Lord: the sea and its fishes will be his.";
B._Deu33_24="And of Asher he said, Let Asher have the blessing of children; may he be pleasing to his brothers, and let his foot be wet with oil.";
B._Deu33_25="Your shoes will be iron and brass; and as your days, so may your work be.";
B._Deu33_26="No other is like the God of Jeshurun, coming on the heavens to your help, and letting his glory be seen in the skies.";
B._Deu33_27="The God of your fathers is your safe resting-place, and under you are his eternal arms: driving out the forces of your haters from before you, he said, Let destruction overtake them.";
B._Deu33_28="And Israel is living in peace, the fountain of Jacob by himself, in a land of grain and wine, with dew dropping from the heavens.";
B._Deu33_29="Happy are you, O Israel: who is like you, a people whose saviour is the Lord, whose help is your cover, whose sword is your strength! All those who are against you will put themselves under your rule, and your feet will be planted on their high places.";
B._Deu34_1="And Moses went up from the table-lands of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah which is facing Jericho. And the Lord let him see all the land, the land of Gilead as far as Dan;";
B._Deu34_2="And all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, as far as the Great Sea of the west;";
B._Deu34_3="And the South, and the circle of the valley of Jericho, the town of palm-trees, as far as Zoar.";
B._Deu34_4="And the Lord said to him, This is the land about which I made an oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed: now I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not go in there.";
