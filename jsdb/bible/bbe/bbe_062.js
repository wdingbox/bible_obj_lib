B._2Ki17_27="Then the king of Assyria gave orders, saying, Send there one of the priests whom you took away, and let him be living there and teaching the people the way of the god of the land.";
B._2Ki17_28="So one of the priests whom they had taken away as a prisoner from Samaria came back, and, living in Beth-el, became their teacher in the worship of the Lord.";
B._2Ki17_29="And every nation made gods for themselves, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in the towns where they were living.";
B._2Ki17_30="The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,";
B._2Ki17_31="The Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites gave their children to be burned in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.";
B._2Ki17_32="So they went on worshipping the Lord, and made for themselves, from among all the people, priests for the high places, to make offerings for them in the houses of the high places.";
B._2Ki17_33="They gave worship to the Lord, but they gave honour to their gods like the nations did from whom they had been taken as prisoners.";
B._2Ki17_34="So to this day they go on in their old ways, not worshipping the Lord or keeping his orders or his ways or the law and the rule which the Lord gave to the children of Jacob, to whom he gave the name Israel;";
B._2Ki17_35="And the Lord made an agreement with them and gave them orders, saying, You are to have no other gods; you are not to give worship to them or be their servants or make them offerings:";
B._2Ki17_36="But the Lord, who took you out of the land of Egypt with his great power and his outstretched arm, he is your God, to whom you are to give worship and make offerings:";
B._2Ki17_37="And the rules and the orders and the law which he put in writing for you, you are to keep and do for ever; you are to have no other gods.";
B._2Ki17_38="And you are to keep in memory the agreement which I have made with you; and you are to have no other gods.";
B._2Ki17_39="And you are to give worship to the Lord your God; for it is he who will give you salvation from the hands of all who are against you.";
B._2Ki17_40="But they gave no attention, but went on in their old way.";
B._2Ki17_41="So these nations, worshipping the Lord, still were servants to the images they had made; their children and their children's children did the same; as their fathers did, so do they, to this day.";
B._2Ki18_1="Now in the third year of Hoshea, son of Elah, king of Israel, Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, became king of Judah.";
B._2Ki18_2="He was twenty-five years old when he became king, ruling in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years; his mother's name was Abi, the daughter of Zechariah.";
B._2Ki18_3="He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as David his father had done.";
B._2Ki18_4="He had the high places taken away, and the stone pillars broken to bits, and the Asherah cut down; and the brass snake which Moses had made was crushed to powder at his order, because in those days the children of Israel had offerings burned before it, and he gave it the name Nehushtan.";
B._2Ki18_5="He had faith in the Lord, the God of Israel; so that there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah who were before him.";
B._2Ki18_6="For his heart was fixed on the Lord, not turning from his ways, and he did his orders which the Lord gave to Moses.";
B._2Ki18_7="And the Lord was with him; he did well in all his undertakings: and he took up arms against the king of Assyria and was his servant no longer.";
B._2Ki18_8="He overcame the Philistines as far as Gaza and its limits, from the tower of the watchman to the walled town.";
B._2Ki18_9="Now in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea, son of Elah, king of Israel, Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, came up against Samaria, shutting it in with his armies.";
B._2Ki18_10="And at the end of three years they took it; in the sixth year of Hezekiah's rule, which was the ninth year of Hoshea, king of Israel, Samaria was taken.";
B._2Ki18_11="And the king of Assyria took Israel away as prisoners into Assyria, placing them in Halah and in Habor on the river Gozan, and in the towns of the Medes;";
B._2Ki18_12="Because they did not give ear to the voice of the Lord their God, but went against his agreement, even against everything ordered by Moses, the servant of the Lord, and they did not give ear to it or do it.";
B._2Ki18_13="Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came up against all the walled towns of Judah and took them.";
B._2Ki18_14="And Hezekiah, king of Judah, sent to Lachish, to the king of Assyria, saying, I have done wrong; give up attacking me, and whatever you put on me I will undergo. And the payment he was to make was fixed by the king of Assyria at three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.";
B._2Ki18_15="So Hezekiah gave him all the silver in the house of the Lord, and in the king's store-house.";
B._2Ki18_16="And at that time Hezekiah had the gold from the doors of the Lord's house, and from the door-pillars plated by him, cut off and gave it to the king of Assyria.";
B._2Ki18_17="Then the king of Assyria sent the Tartan and the Rab-saris and the Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem, to King Hezekiah, with a strong force. And they went up and came to Jerusalem, and took up their position by the stream of the higher pool, by the highway of the washerman's field.";
B._2Ki18_18="And they sent for the king, and Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to them.";
B._2Ki18_19="And the Rab-shakeh said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, These are the words of the great king, the king of Assyria: In what are you placing your hope?";
B._2Ki18_20="You say you have a design, and strength for war, but these are only words. Now to whom are you looking for support, that you have gone against my authority?";
B._2Ki18_21="See, now, you are basing your hope on that broken rod of Egypt, which will go through a man's hand if he makes use of it for a support; for so is Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to all who put their faith in him.";
B._2Ki18_22="And if you say to me, Our hope is in the Lord our God: is it not he, whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away, saying to Judah and Jerusalem that worship may only be given before this altar in Jerusalem?";
B._2Ki18_23="And now, take a chance with my master, the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able to put horsemen on them.";
B._2Ki18_24="How then may you put to shame the least of my master's servants? and you have put your hope in Egypt for war-carriages and horsemen:";
B._2Ki18_25="And have I now come up to send destruction on this place without the Lord's authority? It was the Lord himself who said to me, Go up against this land and make it waste.";
B._2Ki18_26="Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna and Joah said to the Rab-shakeh, Will you kindly make use of the Aramaean language in talking to your servants, for we are used to it, and do not make use of the Jews' language in the hearing of the people on the wall.";
B._2Ki18_27="But the Rab-shakeh said to them, Is it to your master or to you that my master has sent me to say these words? has he not sent me to the men seated on the wall? for they are the people who will be short of food with you when the town is shut in.";
B._2Ki18_28="Then the Rab-shakeh got up and said with a loud voice in the Jews' language, Give ear to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria;";
B._2Ki18_29="This is what the king says: Do not be tricked by Hezekiah, for there is no salvation for you in him.";
B._2Ki18_30="And do not let Hezekiah make you put your faith in the Lord, saying, The Lord will certainly keep us safe, and this town will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.";
B._2Ki18_31="Do not give ear to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me; and everyone will be free to take the fruit of his vine and of his fig-tree, and the water of his spring;";
B._2Ki18_32="Till I come and take you away to a land like yours, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vine-gardens, a land of oil-giving olives and of honey, so that life and not death may be your fate. Give no attention to Hezekiah when he says to you, The Lord will keep us safe.";
B._2Ki18_33="Has any one of the gods of the nations kept his land from falling into the hands of the king of Assyria?";
B._2Ki18_34="Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena and Ivvah? have they kept Samaria out of my hands?";
B._2Ki18_35="Who among all the gods of these countries have kept their country from falling into my hands, to give cause for the thought that the Lord will keep Jerusalem from falling into my hands?";
B._2Ki18_36="But the people kept quiet and gave him no answer: for the king's order was, Give him no answer.";
B._2Ki18_37="Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah, with their clothing parted as a sign of grief, and gave him an account of what the Rab-shakeh had said.";
B._2Ki19_1="And on hearing it, King Hezekiah took off his robe, and put on haircloth, and went into the house of the Lord.";
B._2Ki19_2="And he sent Eliakim, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the chief priests, dressed in haircloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.";
B._2Ki19_3="And they said to him, Hezekiah says, This day is a day of trouble and punishment and shame; for the children are ready to come to birth, but there is no strength to give birth to them.";
B._2Ki19_4="It may be that the Lord your God will give ear to the words of the Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria, his master, sent to say evil things against the living God, and will make his words come to nothing: so then make your prayer for the rest of the people.";
B._2Ki19_5="So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.";

B._2Ki19_8="So the Rab-shakeh went back, and when he got there the king of Assyria was making war against Libnah, for it had come to his ears that he had gone away from Lachish.";
B._2Ki19_9="And when news came to him that Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, had made an attack on him, he sent representatives to Hezekiah again, saying,";
B._2Ki19_10="This is what you are to say to Hezekiah, king of Judah: Let not your God, in whom is your faith, give you a false hope, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.";
B._2Ki19_11="No doubt the story has come to your ears of what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, putting them to the curse; and will you be kept safe?";
B._2Ki19_12="Did the gods of the nations keep safe those on whom my fathers sent destruction, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?";
B._2Ki19_13="Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the town of Sepharvaim, of Hena and of Ivvah?";
B._2Ki19_14="And Hezekiah took the letter from the hands of those who had come with it; and after reading it, Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord, opening the letter there before the Lord.";
B._2Ki19_15="And Hezekiah made his prayer to the Lord, saying, O Lord, the God of Israel, seated between the winged ones, you only are the God of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.";
B._2Ki19_16="Let your ear be turned to us, O Lord, and let your eyes be open, O Lord, and see; take note of all the words of Sennacherib who has sent men to say evil against the living God.";
B._2Ki19_17="Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have made waste the nations and their lands,";
B._2Ki19_18="And have given their gods to the fire; for they were no gods, but wood and stone, the work of men's hands; so they have given them to destruction.";
B._2Ki19_19="But now, O Lord our God, give us salvation from his hands, so that it may be clear to all the kingdoms of the earth that you and only you, O Lord, are God.";
B._2Ki19_20="Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent to Hezekiah, saying, The Lord, the God of Israel, says, The prayer which you have made to me against Sennacherib, king of Assyria, has come to my ears.";

B._2Ki19_22="Against whom have you said evil and bitter things? against whom has your voice been loud and your eyes lifted up? even against the Holy One of Israel.";
B._2Ki19_23="You have sent your servants with evil words against the Lord, and have said, With all my war-carriages I have come up to the top of the mountains, to the inmost parts of Lebanon; its tall cedars will be cut down, and the best trees of its woods; I will come up into his highest places, into his thick woods.";
B._2Ki19_24="I have made water-holes and taken their waters, and with my foot I have made all the rivers of Egypt dry.";
B._2Ki19_25="Has it not come to your ears how I did it long before, purposing it in times long past? Now I have given effect to my design, so that by you strong towns might be turned into masses of broken walls.";
B._2Ki19_26="This is why their townsmen had no power, they were broken and put to shame; they were like the grass of the field and the green plant, like grass on the house-tops.";
B._2Ki19_27="But I have knowledge of your getting up and your resting, of your going out and your coming in.";
B._2Ki19_28="Because your wrath against me and your words of pride have come up to my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my cord in your lips, and I will make you go back by the way you came.";
B._2Ki19_29="And this will be the sign to you: you will get your food this year from what comes up of itself; and in the second year from the produce of the same; and in the third year you will put in your seed and get in the grain and make vine-gardens and take of their fruit.";
B._2Ki19_30="And those of Judah who are still living will again take root in the earth and give fruit.";
B._2Ki19_31="For from Jerusalem those who have been kept safe will go out, and those who are still living will go out of Mount Zion: by the fixed purpose of the Lord of armies this will be done.";
B._2Ki19_32="For this cause the Lord says about the king of Assyria, He will not come into this town, or send an arrow against it; he will not come before it with arms, or put up an earthwork against it;";
B._2Ki19_33="By the way he came he will go back, and he will not get into this town, says the Lord.";
B._2Ki19_34="For I will keep this town safe, for my honour, and for the honour of my servant David.";
B._2Ki19_35="And that night the angel of the Lord went out and put to death in the army of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand men; and when the people got up early in the morning, there was nothing to be seen but dead bodies.";
B._2Ki19_36="So Sennacherib, king of Assyria, went back to his place at Nineveh.";
B._2Ki19_37="And it came about, when he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer put him to death with the sword; and they went in flight into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son became king in his place.";
B._2Ki20_1="In those days Hezekiah was ill and near death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, The Lord says, Put your house in order, for your death is near.";
B._2Ki20_2="Then, turning his face to the wall, he made his prayer to the Lord, saying,";
B._2Ki20_3="O Lord, keep in mind how I have been true to you with all my heart, and have done what is good in your eyes. And Hezekiah gave way to bitter weeping.";
B._2Ki20_4="Now before Isaiah had gone out of the middle of the town, the word of the Lord came to him, saying,";
B._2Ki20_5="Go back and say to Hezekiah, the ruler of my people, The Lord, the God of David your father, says, Your prayer has come to my ears, and I have seen your weeping; see, I will make you well: on the third day you will go up to the house of the Lord.";
B._2Ki20_6="I will give you fifteen more years of life; and I will keep you and this town safe from the hands of the king of Assyria; I will keep this town safe, for my honour, and for the honour of my servant David.";
B._2Ki20_7="Then Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. So they took it and put it on his wound, and he got better.";
B._2Ki20_8="And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What is to be the sign that the Lord will make me well, and that I will go up to the house of the Lord on the third day?";
B._2Ki20_9="And Isaiah said, This is the sign the Lord will give you, that he will do what he has said; will the shade go forward ten degrees or back?";
B._2Ki20_10="And Hezekiah said in answer, It is a simple thing for the shade to go forward; but let it go back ten degrees.";
B._2Ki20_11="Then Isaiah the prophet made prayer to the Lord, and he made the shade go back ten degrees from its position on the steps of Ahaz.";
B._2Ki20_12="At that time, Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters with an offering to Hezekiah, because he had news that Hezekiah had been ill.";
B._2Ki20_13="And Hezekiah was glad at their coming and let them see all his store of wealth, the silver and the gold and the spices and the oil of great price, and the house of his arms, and everything there was in his stores; there was nothing in all his house or his kingdom which Hezekiah did not let them see.";
B._2Ki20_14="Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, What did these men say and where did they come from? And Hezekiah said, They came from a far country, even from Babylon.";
B._2Ki20_15="And he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah said in answer, They saw everything in my house: there is nothing among my stores which I did not let them see.";
B._2Ki20_16="And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Give ear to the word of the Lord.";
B._2Ki20_17="Truly, days are coming when everything in your house, and whatever your fathers have put in store till this day, will be taken away to Babylon: all will be gone, says the Lord.";
B._2Ki20_18="And your sons, the offspring of your body, they will take away to be unsexed servants in the house of the king of Babylon.";
B._2Ki20_19="Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which you have said. Then he said, ... if in my time there is peace and righteousness?";
B._2Ki20_20="Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his power, and how he made the pool and the stream, to take water into the town, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?";

B._2Ki21_3="He put up again the high places which had been pulled down by Hezekiah his father; he made altars for Baal, and an Asherah, as Ahab, king of Israel, had done; he was a worshipper and servant of all the stars of heaven.";
B._2Ki21_4="And he put up altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord had said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.";
B._2Ki21_5="And he put up altars for all the stars of heaven in the two outer squares of the house of the Lord.";
B._2Ki21_6="And he made his son go through the fire, and made use of secret arts and signs for reading the future; he gave positions to those who had control of spirits and to wonder-workers; he did much evil in the eyes of the Lord, moving him to wrath.";
B._2Ki21_7="He put the image of Asherah which he had made in the house of which the Lord had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, the town which I have made mine out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name for ever.";

B._2Ki21_9="But they did not give ear; and Manasseh made them do more evil than those nations did, whom the Lord gave up to destruction before the children of Israel.";
B._2Ki21_10="And the Lord said, by his servants the prophets,";
B._2Ki21_11="Because Manasseh, king of Judah, has done these disgusting things, doing more evil than all the Amorites before him, and making Judah do evil with his false gods,";
