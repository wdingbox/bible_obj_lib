B._Deu19_6="For if not, he who has the right of punishment may go running after the taker of life in the heat of his wrath, and overtake him because the way is long, and give him a death-blow; though it is not right for him to be put to death because he was not moved by hate.";
B._Deu19_7="And so I am ordering you to see that three towns are marked out for this purpose.";
