B._2Ch23_13="And looking, she saw the king in his place by the pillar at the doorway, and the captains and the horns by his side; and all the people of the land were giving signs of joy and sounding the horns; and the makers of melody were playing on instruments of music, taking the chief part in the song of praise. Then Athaliah, violently parting her robes, said, Broken faith, broken faith!";
B._2Ch23_14="Then Jehoiada the priest gave orders to the captains of hundreds who had authority over the army, saying, Take her outside the lines, and let anyone who goes after her be put to death with the sword. For the priest said, Let her not be put to death in the house of the Lord.";
B._2Ch23_15="So they put their hands on her, and she went to the king's house by the doorway of the king's horses; and there she was put to death.";
B._2Ch23_16="And Jehoiada made an agreement between the Lord and all the people and the king, that they would be the Lord's people.";
B._2Ch23_17="Then all the people went to the house of Baal and had it pulled down, and its altars and images broken up; and Mattan, the priest of Baal, they put to death before the altars.";
B._2Ch23_18="And Jehoiada put the work and the care of the house of the Lord into the hands of the priests and the Levites, who had been grouped in divisions by David to make burned offerings to the Lord, as it is recorded in the law of Moses, with joy and song as David had said.";
B._2Ch23_19="And he put door-keepers at the doors of the Lord's house, to see that no one who was unclean in any way might come in.";
B._2Ch23_20="Then he took the captains of hundreds and the chiefs and the rulers of the people and all the people of the land, and they came down with the king from the house of the Lord through the higher doorway into the king's house, and put the king on the seat of the kingdom.";
B._2Ch23_21="So all the people of the land were glad and the town was quiet, for they had put Athaliah to death with the sword.";
B._2Ch24_1="Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he was ruling for forty years in Jerusalem: his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.";
B._2Ch24_2="And Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as long as Jehoiada the priest was living.";
B._2Ch24_3="And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he became the father of sons and daughters.";
B._2Ch24_4="Now after this Joash had a desire to put the house of the Lord into good order again;";
B._2Ch24_5="And getting together the priests and Levites, he said to them, Go out into the towns of Judah year by year, and get from all Israel money to keep the house of your God in good condition; and see that this is done without loss of time. The Levites, however, were slow in doing so.";
B._2Ch24_6="Then the king sent for Jehoiada, the chief priest, and said to him, Why have you not given the Levites orders that the tax fixed by Moses, the servant of the Lord, and by the meeting of Israel, for the Tent of witness, is to be got in from Judah and Jerusalem and handed over?";
B._2Ch24_7="For the house of the Lord had been broken up by Athaliah, that evil woman, and her sons; and all its holy things they had given to the Baals.";
B._2Ch24_8="So at the king's order they made a chest and put it outside the doorway of the house of the Lord.";
B._2Ch24_9="And an order was sent out through all Judah and Jerusalem that payment was to be made to the Lord of the tax which Moses, the servant of God, had put on Israel in the waste land.";
B._2Ch24_10="And all the chiefs and all the people came gladly and put their money into the chest, till they had all given.";
B._2Ch24_11="So when the chest was taken to the king's servants by the Levites, and they saw that there was much money in it, the king's scribe and the chief priest's servant took the money out, and put the chest back in its place. They did this day by day, and got together a great amount of money.";
B._2Ch24_12="Then the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who were responsible for getting the work done on the Lord's house, and with it they got wall-builders and woodworkers and metal-workers to put the house of the Lord in good order again.";
B._2Ch24_13="So the workmen did their work, making good what was damaged and building up the house of God till it was strong and beautiful again.";
B._2Ch24_14="And when the work was done, they took the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, and it was used for making the vessels for the house of the Lord, all the vessels needed for the offerings, the spoons and the vessels of gold and silver. And as long as Jehoiada was living, the regular burned offerings were offered in the house of the Lord.";
B._2Ch24_15="But Jehoiada became old and full of days, and he came to his end; he was a hundred and thirty years old at the time of his death.";
B._2Ch24_16="And they put him into his last resting-place in the town of David, among the kings, because he had done good in Israel for God and for his house.";
B._2Ch24_17="Now after the death of Jehoiada, the chiefs of Judah came and went down on their faces before the king. Then the king gave ear to them.";
B._2Ch24_18="And they gave up the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and became worshippers of pillars of wood and of the images; and because of this sin of theirs, wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem.";
B._2Ch24_19="And the Lord sent them prophets to make them come back to him; and they gave witness against them, but they would not give ear.";
B._2Ch24_20="Then the spirit of God came on Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada the priest, and, getting up before the people, he said to them, God has said, Why do you go against the orders of the Lord, so that everything goes badly for you? because you have given up the Lord, he has given you up.";
B._2Ch24_21="But when they had made a secret design against him, he was stoned with stones, by the king's order, in the outer square of the Lord's house.";
B._2Ch24_22="So King Joash did not keep in mind how good Jehoiada his father had been to him, but put his son to death. And in the hour of his death he said, May the Lord see it and take payment!";
B._2Ch24_23="Now in the spring, the army of the Aramaeans came up against him; they came against Judah and Jerusalem, putting to death all the great men of the people and sending all the goods they took from them to the king of Damascus.";
B._2Ch24_24="For though the army of Aram was only a small one, the Lord gave a very great army into their hands, because they had given up the Lord, the God of their fathers. So they put into effect the punishment of Joash.";
B._2Ch24_25="And when they had gone away from him, (for he was broken with disease,) his servants made a secret design against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they put him to death on his bed; and they put his body into the earth in the town of David, but not in the resting-place of the kings.";
B._2Ch24_26="Those who made designs against him were Zabad, the son of Shimeath, an Ammonite woman, and Jehozabad, the son of Shimrith, a Moabite woman.";
B._2Ch24_27="Now the story of his sons, and all the words said by the prophet against him, and the building up again of the Lord's house, are recorded in the account in the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son became king in his place.";
B._2Ch25_1="Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years; his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.";
B._2Ch25_2="He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, but his heart was not completely true to the Lord.";
B._2Ch25_3="Now when he became strong in the kingdom, he put to death those men who had taken the life of the king his father.";
B._2Ch25_4="But he did not put their children to death, for he kept the orders of the Lord recorded in the book of the law of Moses, saying, The fathers are not to be put to death for their children or the children for their fathers, but a man is to be put to death for the sin which he himself has done.";
B._2Ch25_5="Then Amaziah got all Judah together and put them in order by their families, even all Judah and Benjamin, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds: and he had those of twenty years old and over numbered, and they came to three hundred thousand of the best fighting-men, trained for war and in the use of the spear and the body-cover.";
B._2Ch25_6="And for a hundred talents of silver, he got a hundred thousand fighting-men from Israel.";
B._2Ch25_7="But a man of God came to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with you; for the Lord is not with Israel, that is, the children of Ephraim.";
B._2Ch25_8="But go yourself, and be strong in war; God will not let you go down before those who are fighting against you; for God has power to give help or to send you down before your attackers.";
B._2Ch25_9="Then Amaziah said to the man of God, But what is to be done about the hundred talents which I have given for the armed band of Israel? And the man of God in answer said, God is able to give you much more than this.";
B._2Ch25_10="So Amaziah, separating the armed band which had come to him from Ephraim, sent them back again; which made them very angry with Judah, and they went back burning with wrath.";
B._2Ch25_11="Then Amaziah took heart, and went out at the head of his people and came to the Valley of Salt, where he put to death ten thousand of the children of Seir;";
B._2Ch25_12="And ten thousand more the children of Israel took living, and made them go up to the top of the rock, pushing them down from the top of the rock so that their bodies were broken by the fall.";
B._2Ch25_13="But the men of the band which Amaziah sent back and did not take with him to the fight, made attacks on the towns of Judah from Samaria to Beth-horon, putting to death three thousand of their people and taking away a great store of their goods.";
B._2Ch25_14="Now when Amaziah came back from the destruction of the Edomites, he took the gods of the children of Seir and made them his gods, worshipping them and burning offerings before them.";
B._2Ch25_15="And so the wrath of the Lord was moved against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who said, Why have you gone after the gods of the people who have not given their people salvation from your hands?";
B._2Ch25_16="But while he was talking to him the king said to him, Have we made you one of the king's government? say no more, or it will be the cause of your death. Then the prophet gave up protesting, and said, It is clear to me that God's purpose is your destruction, because you have done this and have not given ear to my words.";
B._2Ch25_17="Then Amaziah, king of Judah, acting on the suggestion of his servants, sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us have a meeting face to face.";
B._2Ch25_18="And Joash, king of Israel, sent to Amaziah, king of Judah, saying, The thorn-tree in Lebanon sent to the cedar in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son for a wife: and a beast from the woodland in Lebanon went by, crushing the thorn under his feet.";
B._2Ch25_19="You say, See, I have overcome Edom; and your heart is lifted up with pride: now keep in your country; why do you make causes of trouble, putting yourself, and Judah with you, in danger of downfall?";
B._2Ch25_20="But Amaziah gave no attention; and this was the purpose of God, so that he might give them up into the hands of Joash, because they had gone after the gods of Edom.";
B._2Ch25_21="And so Joash, king of Israel, went up; and he and Amaziah, king of Judah, came face to face at Beth-shemesh in Judah.";
B._2Ch25_22="And Judah was overcome before Israel, and they went in flight, every man to his tent.";
B._2Ch25_23="And Joash, king of Israel, made Amaziah, king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, prisoner at Beth-shemesh, and took him to Jerusalem; and he had the wall of Jerusalem pulled down from the doorway of Ephraim to the doorway in the angle, four hundred cubits.";
B._2Ch25_24="And he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels which were in the house of the Lord, under the care of Obed-edom, and all the wealth from the king's house, as well as those whose lives would be the price of broken faith, and went back to Samaria.";
B._2Ch25_25="Amaziah, son of Joash, king of Judah, went on living for fifteen years after the death of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.";
B._2Ch25_26="Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, are they not recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?";
B._2Ch25_27="Now from the time when Amaziah gave up worshipping the Lord, they made secret designs against him in Jerusalem; and he went in flight to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him and put him to death there.";
B._2Ch25_28="And they took his body on horseback and put it into the earth with his fathers in the town of David.";
B._2Ch26_1="Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.";
B._2Ch26_2="He was the builder of Eloth, which he got back for Judah after the death of the king.";
B._2Ch26_3="Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for fifty-two years; his mother's name was Jechiliah of Jerusalem.";
B._2Ch26_4="He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Amaziah had done.";
B._2Ch26_5="He gave himself to searching after God in the days of Zechariah, who made men wise in the fear of God; and as long as he was true to the Lord, God made things go well for him.";
B._2Ch26_6="He went out and made war against the Philistines, pulling down the walls of Gath and Jabneh and Ashdod, and building towns in the country round Ashdod and among the Philistines.";
B._2Ch26_7="And God gave him help against the Philistines, and against the Arabians living in Gur-baal, and against the Meunim.";
B._2Ch26_8="The Ammonites gave offerings to Uzziah: and news of him went out as far as the limit of Egypt; for he became very great in power.";
B._2Ch26_9="Uzziah made towers in Jerusalem, at the doorway in the angle and at the doorway in the valley and at the turn of the wall, arming them.";
B._2Ch26_10="And he put up towers in the waste land and made places for storing water, for he had much cattle, in the low hills and in the table land; and he had farmers and vine-keepers in the mountains and in the fertile land, for he was a lover of farming.";
B._2Ch26_11="In addition, Uzziah had an army of fighting-men who went out to war in bands, as they had been listed by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the authority of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.";
B._2Ch26_12="The heads of families, the strong men of war, were two thousand, six hundred.";
B._2Ch26_13="And under their orders was a trained army of three hundred and seven thousand, five hundred, of great strength in war, helping the king against any who came against him.";
B._2Ch26_14="And Uzziah had all these forces armed with body-covers and spears and head-covers and coats of metal and bows and stones for sending from leather bands.";
B._2Ch26_15="And in Jerusalem he made machines, the invention of expert men, to be placed on the towers and angles of the walls for sending arrows and great stones. And his name was honoured far and wide; for he was greatly helped till he was strong.";
B._2Ch26_16="But when he had become strong, his heart was lifted up in pride, causing his destruction; and he did evil against the Lord his God; for he went into the Temple of the Lord for the purpose of burning perfumes on the altar of perfumes.";
B._2Ch26_17="And Azariah the priest went in after him, with eighty of the Lord's priests, who were strong men;";
B._2Ch26_18="And they made protests to Uzziah the king, and said to him, The burning of perfumes, Uzziah, is not your business but that of the priests, the sons of Aaron, who have been made holy for this work: go out of the holy place, for you have done wrong, and it will not be to your honour before God.";
B._2Ch26_19="Then Uzziah was angry; and he had in his hand a vessel for burning perfume; and while his wrath was bitter against the priests, the mark of the leper's disease came out on his brow, before the eyes of the priests in the house of the Lord by the altar of perfumes.";
B._2Ch26_20="And Azariah, the chief priest, and all the priests, looking at him, saw the mark of the leper on his brow, and they sent him out quickly and he himself went out straight away, for the Lord's punishment had come on him.";
B._2Ch26_21="So King Uzziah was a leper till the day of his death, living separately in his private house; for he was cut off from the house of God; and Jotham his son was ruling over his house, judging the people of the land.";
B._2Ch26_22="Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, were recorded by Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.";
B._2Ch26_23="So Uzziah went to rest with his fathers; and they put his body into the earth in the field used for the resting-place of the kings, for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son became king in his place.";
B._2Ch27_1="Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years; and his mother's name was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.";
B._2Ch27_2="He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Uzziah had done; but he did not go into the Temple of the Lord. And the people still went on in their evil ways.";
B._2Ch27_3="He put up the higher doorway of the house of the Lord, and did much building on the wall of the Ophel.";
B._2Ch27_4="In addition, he made towns in the hill-country of Judah, and strong buildings and towers in the woodlands.";
B._2Ch27_5="He went to war with the king of the children of Ammon and overcame them. That year, the children of Ammon gave him a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of grain and ten thousand measures of barley. And the children of Ammon gave him the same amount the second year and the third.";
B._2Ch27_6="So Jotham became strong, because in all his ways he made the Lord his guide.";
B._2Ch27_7="Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.";
B._2Ch27_8="He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years.";
B._2Ch27_9="And Jotham went to rest with his fathers, and they put his body into the earth in the town of David; and Ahaz his son became king in his place.";
B._2Ch28_1="Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years; he did not do what was right in the eyes of the Lord, like David his father:";
B._2Ch28_2="But he went in the ways of the kings of Israel and made images of metal for the Baals.";
B._2Ch28_3="More than this, he had offerings burned in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and made his children go through fire, copying the disgusting ways of the nations whom the Lord had sent out of the land before the children of Israel.";
B._2Ch28_4="And he made offerings and had perfumes burned in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.";
B._2Ch28_5="So the Lord his God gave him up into the hands of the king of Aram; and they overcame him, and took away a great number of his people as prisoners to Damascus. Then he was given into the hands of the king of Israel, who sent great destruction on him.";
B._2Ch28_6="For Pekah, the son of Remaliah, in one day put to death a hundred and twenty thousand men of Judah, all of them good fighting-men; because they had given up the Lord, the God of their fathers.";
B._2Ch28_7="And Zichri, a great fighting-man of Ephraim, put to death Maaseiah, the king's son, and Azrikam, the controller of his house, and Elkanah, who was second in authority to the king.";
B._2Ch28_8="And the children of Israel took away as prisoners from their brothers, two hundred thousand, women and sons and daughters, and a great store of their goods, and took them to Samaria.";
B._2Ch28_9="But a prophet of the Lord was there, named Oded; and he went out in front of the army which was coming into Samaria and said to them, Truly, because the Lord, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them up into your hands, and you have put them to death in an outburst of wrath stretching up to heaven.";
B._2Ch28_10="And now your purpose is to keep the children of Judah and Jerusalem as men-servants and women-servants under your yoke: but are there no sins against the Lord your God to be seen among yourselves?";
B._2Ch28_11="And now give ear to me, and send back the prisoners whom you have taken from your brothers: for the wrath of the Lord is burning against you.";
B._2Ch28_12="Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah, the son of Johanan, Berechiah, the son of Meshillemoth Jehizkiah, the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, put themselves against those who had come from the war,";
B._2Ch28_13="And said to them, You are not to let these prisoners come here; for what you are designing to do will be a cause of sin against the Lord to us, making even greater our sin and our wrongdoing, which now are great enough, and his wrath is burning against Israel.";
B._2Ch28_14="So the armed men gave up the prisoners and the goods they had taken to the heads and the meeting of the people.";
B._2Ch28_15="And those men who have been named went up and took the prisoners, clothing those among them who were uncovered, with things from the goods which had been taken in the war, and putting robes on them and shoes on their feet; and they gave them food and drink and oil for their bodies, and seating all the feeble among them on asses, they took them to Jericho, the town of palm-trees, to their people, and then went back to Samaria.";
B._2Ch28_16="At that time King Ahaz sent for help to the king of Assyria.";
B._2Ch28_17="For the Edomites had come again, attacking Judah and taking away prisoners.";
B._2Ch28_18="And the Philistines, forcing their way into the towns of the lowlands and the south of Judah, had taken Beth-shemesh and Aijalon and Gederoth and Soco, with their daughter-towns, as well as Timnah and Gimzo and their daughter-towns, and were living there.";
B._2Ch28_19="For the Lord made Judah low, because of Ahaz, king of Israel; for he had given up all self-control in Judah, sinning greatly against the Lord.";
B._2Ch28_20="Then Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, came to him, but was a cause of trouble and not of strength to him.";
B._2Ch28_21="For Ahaz took a part of the wealth from the house of the Lord, and from the house of the king and of the great men, and gave it to the king of Assyria; but it was no help to him.";
B._2Ch28_22="And in the time of his trouble, this same King Ahaz did even more evil against the Lord.";
B._2Ch28_23="For he made offerings to the gods of Damascus, who were attacking him, and said, Because the gods of the kings of Aram are giving them help, I will make offerings to them so that they may give me help. But they were the cause of his downfall, and of that of all Israel.";
B._2Ch28_24="And Ahaz got together the vessels of the house of God, cutting up all the vessels of the house of God, and shutting the doors of the Lord's house; and he made altars in every part of Jerusalem.";
B._2Ch28_25="And in every town of Judah he made high places where perfumes were burned to other gods, awaking the wrath of the Lord, the God of his fathers.";

B._2Ch29_3="In the first year of his rule, in the first month, opening the doors of the Lord's house, he made them strong.";
B._2Ch29_4="And he sent for the priests and the Levites, and got them together in the wide place on the east side,";
B._2Ch29_5="And said to them, Give ear to me, O Levites: now make yourselves holy, and make holy the house of the Lord, the God of your fathers, and take away everything unclean from the holy place.";
B._2Ch29_6="For our fathers have done evil, sinning in the eyes of the Lord our God, and have given him up, turning away their faces from the house of the Lord, and turning their backs on him.";
B._2Ch29_7="The doors of his house have been shut and the lights put out; no perfumes have been burned or offerings made to the God of Israel in his holy place.";
B._2Ch29_8="And so the wrath of the Lord has come on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has given them up to be a cause of fear and wonder and shame, as your eyes have seen.";
