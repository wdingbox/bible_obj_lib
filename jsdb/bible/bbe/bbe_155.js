B._Jhn2_10="And said to him, Every man first puts out his best wine and when all have had enough he puts out what is not so good; but you have kept the good wine till now.";
B._Jhn2_11="This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee and let his glory be seen openly; and his disciples put their faith in him.";
B._Jhn2_12="After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples, and they were there not more than two or three days.";
B._Jhn2_13="The time of the Passover of the Jews was near and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.";
B._Jhn2_14="And there in the Temple he saw men trading in oxen and sheep and doves, and he saw the changers of money in their seats:";
B._Jhn2_15="And he made a whip of small cords and put them all out of the Temple, with the sheep and the oxen, sending in all directions the small money of the changers and overturning their tables;";
B._Jhn2_16="And to those who were trading in doves he said, Take these things away; do not make my Father's house a market.";
B._Jhn2_17="And it came to the minds of the disciples that the Writings say, I am on fire with passion for your house.";
B._Jhn2_18="Then the Jews put this question to him: What sign of authority have you to give us, seeing that you do these things?";
B._Jhn2_19="And Jesus said to them, Send destruction on this Temple and I will put it up again in three days.";
B._Jhn2_20="The Jews said, The building of this Temple took forty-six years; and you will put it up in three days!";
B._Jhn2_21="But his words were about that holy building which was his body.";
B._Jhn2_22="So when he had come back again from the dead, the memory of these words came back to the disciples, and they had faith in the holy Writings and in the word which Jesus had said.";
B._Jhn2_23="Now while he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover, a great number of people came to have faith in his name, after seeing the signs which he did.";
B._Jhn2_24="But Jesus did not have faith in them, because he had knowledge of them all.";
B._Jhn2_25="He had no need for any witness about man; for he himself had knowledge of what was in man.";
B._Jhn3_1="Now there was among the Pharisees a man named Nicodemus, who was one of the rulers of the Jews.";
B._Jhn3_2="He came to Jesus by night and said to him, Rabbi, we are certain that you have come from God as a teacher, because no man would be able to do these signs which you do if God was not with him.";
B._Jhn3_3="Jesus said to him, Truly, I say to you, Without a new birth no man is able to see the kingdom of God.";
B._Jhn3_4="Nicodemus said to him, How is it possible for a man to be given birth when he is old? Is he able to go into his mother's body a second time and come to birth again?";
B._Jhn3_5="Jesus said in answer, Truly, I say to you, If a man's birth is not from water and from the Spirit, it is not possible for him to go into the kingdom of God.";
B._Jhn3_6="That which has birth from the flesh is flesh, and that which has birth from the Spirit is spirit.";
B._Jhn3_7="Do not be surprised that I say to you, It is necessary for you to have a second birth.";
B._Jhn3_8="The wind goes where its pleasure takes it, and the sound of it comes to your ears, but you are unable to say where it comes from and where it goes: so it is with everyone whose birth is from the Spirit.";
B._Jhn3_9="And Nicodemus said to him, How is it possible for these things to be?";
B._Jhn3_10="And Jesus, answering, said, Are you the teacher of Israel and have no knowledge of these things?";
B._Jhn3_11="Truly, I say to you, We say that of which we have knowledge; we give witness of what we have seen; and you do not take our witness to be true.";
B._Jhn3_12="If you have no belief when my words are about the things of earth, how will you have belief if my words are about the things of heaven?";
B._Jhn3_13="And no one has ever gone up to heaven but he who came down from heaven, the Son of man.";
B._Jhn3_14="As the snake was lifted up by Moses in the waste land, even so it is necessary for the Son of man to be lifted up:";
B._Jhn3_15="So that whoever has faith may have in him eternal life.";
B._Jhn3_16="For God had such love for the world that he gave his only Son, so that whoever has faith in him may not come to destruction but have eternal life.";
B._Jhn3_17="God did not send his Son into the world to be judge of the world; he sent him so that the world might have salvation through him.";
B._Jhn3_18="The man who has faith in him does not come up to be judged; but he who has no faith in him has been judged even now, because he has no faith in the name of the only Son of God.";
B._Jhn3_19="And this is the test by which men are judged: the light has come into the world and men have more love for the dark than for the light, because their acts are evil.";
B._Jhn3_20="The light is hated by everyone whose acts are evil and he does not come to the light for fear that his acts will be seen.";
B._Jhn3_21="But he whose life is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his acts have been done by the help of God.";
B._Jhn3_22="After these things Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judaea, and there he was with them for some time, giving baptism.";
B._Jhn3_23="Now John was then giving baptism at Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came and were given baptism.";
B._Jhn3_24="For at this time John had not been put into prison.";
B._Jhn3_25="Then a question came up between John's disciples and a Jew about washing.";
B._Jhn3_26="And they went to John and said to him, Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the man to whom you gave witness, is now giving baptism, and everyone is going to him.";
B._Jhn3_27="And this was John's answer: A man is unable to have anything if it is not given to him from heaven.";
B._Jhn3_28="You yourselves give witness that I said, I am not the Christ. What I said was, I am sent before the Christ.";
B._Jhn3_29="He who has the bride is the husband: but the husband's friend, whose place is by his side and whose ears are open to him, is full of joy because of the husband's voice: such is my joy, and it is complete.";
B._Jhn3_30="He has to become greater while I become less.";
B._Jhn3_31="He who comes from heaven is greater than all others: he who comes from earth is of the earth, and of the earth are his words: he who comes from heaven is over all.";
B._Jhn3_32="He gives witness of what he has seen and of what has come to his ears; and no man takes his witness as true.";
B._Jhn3_33="He who so takes his witness has made clear his faith that God is true.";
B._Jhn3_34="For he whom God has sent says God's words; and God does not give him the Spirit by measure.";
B._Jhn3_35="The Father has love for the Son and has put all things into his hands.";
B._Jhn3_36="He who has faith in the Son has eternal life; but he who has not faith in the Son will not see life; God's wrath is resting on him.";
B._Jhn4_1="Now when it was clear to the Lord that word had come to the ears of the Pharisees that Jesus was making more disciples than John and was giving them baptism";
B._Jhn4_2="(Though, in fact, it was his disciples who gave baptism, not Jesus himself),";
B._Jhn4_3="He went out of Judaea into Galilee again.";
B._Jhn4_4="And it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.";
B._Jhn4_5="So he came to a town of Samaria which was named Sychar, near to the bit of land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph:";
B._Jhn4_6="Now Jacob's fountain was there. Jesus, being tired after his journey, was resting by the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.";
B._Jhn4_7="A woman of Samaria came to get water, and Jesus said to her, Give me some water.";
B._Jhn4_8="For his disciples had gone to the town to get food.";
B._Jhn4_9="The woman of Samaria said to him, Why do you, a Jew, make a request for water to me, a woman of Samaria? She said this because Jews have nothing to do with the people of Samaria.";
B._Jhn4_10="In answer Jesus said, If you had knowledge of what God gives freely and who it is who says to you, Give me water, you would make your prayer to him, and he would give you living water.";
B._Jhn4_11="The woman said to him, Sir, you have no vessel and the fountain is deep; from where will you get the living water?";
B._Jhn4_12="Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the fountain and took the water of it himself, with his children and his cattle?";
B._Jhn4_13="Jesus said to her, Everyone who takes this water will be in need of it again:";
B._Jhn4_14="But whoever takes the water I give him will never be in need of drink again; for the water I give him will become in him a fountain of eternal life.";
B._Jhn4_15="The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, so that I may not be in need again of drink and will not have to come all this way for it.";
B._Jhn4_16="Jesus said to her, Go, get your husband and come back here with him.";
B._Jhn4_17="In answer, the woman said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have said rightly, I have no husband:";
B._Jhn4_18="You have had five husbands, and the man you have now is not your husband: that was truly said.";
B._Jhn4_19="The woman said to him, Sir, I see that you are a prophet.";
B._Jhn4_20="Our fathers gave worship on this mountain, but you Jews say that the right place for worship is in Jerusalem.";
B._Jhn4_21="Jesus said to her, Woman, take my word for this; the time is coming when you will not give worship to the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem.";
B._Jhn4_22="You give worship, but without knowledge of what you are worshipping: we give worship to what we have knowledge of: for salvation comes from the Jews.";
B._Jhn4_23="But the time is coming, and is even now here, when the true worshippers will give worship to the Father in the true way of the spirit, for these are the worshippers desired by the Father.";
B._Jhn4_24="God is Spirit: then let his worshippers give him worship in the true way of the spirit.";
B._Jhn4_25="The woman said to him, I am certain that the Messiah, who is named Christ, is coming; when he comes he will make all things clear to us.";
B._Jhn4_26="Jesus said to her, I, who am talking to you, am he.";
B._Jhn4_27="At that point the disciples came back, and they were surprised to see him talking to a woman; but not one of them said to him, What is your purpose? or, Why are you talking to her?";
B._Jhn4_28="Then the woman put down her water-pot and went into the town, and said to the people,";
B._Jhn4_29="Come and see a man who has been talking to me of everything I ever did! Is it possible that this is the Christ?";
B._Jhn4_30="So they went out of the town and came to him.";
B._Jhn4_31="While this was taking place, the disciples were saying to Jesus, Master, take some food.";
B._Jhn4_32="But he said to them, I have food of which you have no knowledge.";
B._Jhn4_33="So the disciples said one to another, Did anyone give him food?";
B._Jhn4_34="Jesus said, My food is to do the pleasure of him who sent me and to make his work complete.";
B._Jhn4_35="You would say, Four months from now is the time of the grain-cutting. Take a look, I say to you, at the fields; they are even now white for cutting.";
B._Jhn4_36="He who does the cutting now has his reward; he is getting together fruit for eternal life, so that he who did the planting and he who gets in the grain may have joy together.";
B._Jhn4_37="In this the saying is a true one, One does the planting, and another gets in the grain.";
B._Jhn4_38="I sent you to get in grain which you had no hand in planting: other men did that work, and you take the reward.";
B._Jhn4_39="Now a number of the people of that town had faith in him because of the woman's witness: He has been talking to me of everything I ever did.";
B._Jhn4_40="So when the people came to him they made request to him to be among them for a time, and he was there two days.";
B._Jhn4_41="And a great number more of them came to have faith in him because of what he himself said.";
B._Jhn4_42="And they said to the woman, Now we have faith, but not because of your story: we ourselves have given ear to his words, and we are certain that he is truly the Saviour of the world.";
B._Jhn4_43="And after the two days he went on from there into Galilee.";
B._Jhn4_44="For Jesus himself said that a prophet has no honour in the country of his birth.";
B._Jhn4_45="So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans took him to their hearts because of the things which they had seen him do in Jerusalem at the feast--they themselves having been there at the feast.";
B._Jhn4_46="So he came to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain man of high position whose son was ill at Capernaum.";
B._Jhn4_47="When it came to his ears that Jesus had come from Judaea into Galilee, he went to him and made a request that he would come down to his son, who was near to death, and make him well.";
B._Jhn4_48="Then Jesus said to him, You will not have faith if you do not see signs and wonders.";
B._Jhn4_49="The man said, Sir, come down before my boy is dead.";
B._Jhn4_50="And Jesus said, Go in peace; your son is living. The man had faith in the word which Jesus said to him and went away.";
B._Jhn4_51="And while he was going down, his servants came to him and said, Your boy is living.";
B._Jhn4_52="So he put a question to them as to the hour when he became better; and they said to him, The disease went from him yesterday at the seventh hour.";
B._Jhn4_53="It was clear then to the father that this was the very time at which Jesus said to him, Your son is living. And he had faith in Jesus, he and all his family.";
B._Jhn4_54="Now this is the second sign which Jesus did after he had come out of Judaea into Galilee.";
B._Jhn5_1="After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.";
B._Jhn5_2="Now in Jerusalem near the sheep-market there is a public bath which in Hebrew is named Beth-zatha. It has five doorways.";
B._Jhn5_3="In these doorways there were a great number of people with different diseases: some unable to see, some without the power of walking, some with wasted bodies.";
B._Jhn5_4="[]";
B._Jhn5_5="One man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.";
B._Jhn5_6="When Jesus saw him there on the floor it was clear to him that he had been now a long time in that condition, and so he said to the man, Is it your desire to get well?";
B._Jhn5_7="The ill man said in answer, Sir, I have nobody to put me into the bath when the water is moving; and while I am on the way down some other person gets in before me.";
B._Jhn5_8="Jesus said to him, Get up, take your bed and go.";
B._Jhn5_9="And the man became well straight away, and took up his bed and went. Now that day was the Sabbath.";
B._Jhn5_10="So the Jews said to the man who had been made well, It is the Sabbath; and it is against the law for you to take up your bed.";
B._Jhn5_11="He said to them, But he who made me well, said to me, Take up your bed and go.";
B._Jhn5_12="Then they put to him the question: Who is the man who said to you, Take it up and go?";
B._Jhn5_13="Now he who had been made well had no knowledge who it was, Jesus having gone away because of the number of people who were in that place.";
B._Jhn5_14="After a time Jesus came across him in the Temple and said to him, See, you are well and strong; do no more sin for fear a worse thing comes to you.";
B._Jhn5_15="The man went away and said to the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.";
B._Jhn5_16="And for this reason the Jews were turned against Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.";
B._Jhn5_17="But his answer was: My Father is still working even now, and so I am working.";
B._Jhn5_18="For this cause the Jews had an even greater desire to put Jesus to death, because not only did he not keep the Sabbath but he said God was his Father, so making himself equal with God.";
B._Jhn5_19="So Jesus made answer and said, Truly I say to you, The Son is not able to do anything himself; he is able to do only what he sees the Father doing; whatever the Father does the Son does it in the same way.";
B._Jhn5_20="For the Father has love for the Son and lets him see everything which he does: and he will let him see greater works than these so that you may be full of wonder.";
B._Jhn5_21="In the same way, as the Father gives life to the dead, even so the Son gives life to those to whom he is pleased to give it.";
B._Jhn5_22="The Father is not the judge of men, but he has given all decisions into the hands of the Son;";
B._Jhn5_23="So that all men may give honour to the Son even as they give honour to the Father. He who gives no honour to the Son gives no honour to the Father who sent him.";
B._Jhn5_24="Truly I say to you, The man whose ears are open to my word and who has faith in him who sent me, has eternal life; he will not be judged, but has come from death into life.";
B._Jhn5_25="Truly I say to you, The time is coming, it has even now come, when the voice of the Son of God will come to the ears of the dead, and those hearing it will have life.";
B._Jhn5_26="For even as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son to have life in himself.";
B._Jhn5_27="And he has given him authority to be judge because he is the Son of man.";
B._Jhn5_28="Do not be surprised at this: for the time is coming when his voice will come to all who are in the place of the dead,";
B._Jhn5_29="And they will come out; those who have done good, into the new life; and those who have done evil, to be judged.";
B._Jhn5_30="Of myself I am unable to do anything: as the voice comes to me so I give a decision: and my decision is right because I have no desire to do what is pleasing to myself, but only what is pleasing to him who sent me.";
B._Jhn5_31="If I gave witness about myself, my witness would not be true.";
B._Jhn5_32="There is another who gives witness about me and I am certain that the witness he gives about me is true.";
B._Jhn5_33="You sent to John and he gave true witness.";
B._Jhn5_34="But I have no need of a man's witness: I only say these things so that you may have salvation.";
B._Jhn5_35="He was a burning and shining light, and for a time you were ready to be happy in his light.";
B._Jhn5_36="But the witness which I have is greater than that of John: the work which the Father has given me to do, the very work which I am now doing, is a witness that the Father has sent me.";
B._Jhn5_37="And the Father himself who sent me has given witness about me. Not one of you has ever given ear to his voice; his form you have not seen.";
B._Jhn5_38="And you have not kept his word in your hearts, because you have not faith in him whom he has sent.";
B._Jhn5_39="You make search in the holy Writings, in the belief that through them you get eternal life; and it is those Writings which give witness about me.";
B._Jhn5_40="And still you have no desire to come to me so that you may have life.";
B._Jhn5_41="I do not take honour from men;";
B._Jhn5_42="But I have knowledge of you that you have no love for God in your hearts.";
B._Jhn5_43="I have come in my Father's name, and your hearts are not open to me. If another comes with no other authority but himself, you will give him your approval.";
B._Jhn5_44="How is it possible for you to have faith while you take honour one from another and have no desire for the honour which comes from the only God?";
B._Jhn5_45="Put out of your minds the thought that I will say things against you to the Father: the one who says things against you is Moses, on whom you put your hopes.";
B._Jhn5_46="If you had belief in Moses you would have belief in me; for his writings are about me.";
B._Jhn5_47="If you have no belief in his writings, how will you have belief in my words?";
B._Jhn6_1="After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee--that is, the sea of Tiberias.";
B._Jhn6_2="And a great number of people went after him because they saw the signs which he did on those who were ill.";
B._Jhn6_3="Then Jesus went up the mountain and was seated there with his disciples.";
B._Jhn6_4="Now the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.";
B._Jhn6_5="Lifting up his eyes, Jesus saw a great number of people coming to where he was, and he said to Philip, Where may we get bread for all these people?";
B._Jhn6_6="This he said, testing him: for he had no doubt what he himself would do.";
B._Jhn6_7="Philip made answer, Bread to the value of two hundred pence would not be enough even to give everyone a little.";
B._Jhn6_8="One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said to Jesus,";
B._Jhn6_9="There is a boy here with five barley cakes and two fishes: but what is that among such a number?";
B._Jhn6_10="Jesus said, Let the people be seated. Now there was much grass in that place. And those seated on the grass were about five thousand.";
B._Jhn6_11="Then Jesus took the cakes and having given praise to God, he gave them to the people who were seated, and the fishes in the same way, as much as they had need of.";
B._Jhn6_12="And when they had had enough, Jesus said to his disciples, Take up the broken bits which are over, so that nothing may be wasted.";
B._Jhn6_13="So they took them up: twelve baskets full of broken bits of the five cakes which were over after the people had had enough.";
B._Jhn6_14="And when the people saw the sign which he had done, they said, Truly, this is the prophet who is to come into the world.";
B._Jhn6_15="Now when Jesus saw that the people were about to come and take him by force to make him a king, he went away again up the mountain by himself.";
B._Jhn6_16="When evening came the disciples went down to the sea;";
B._Jhn6_17="And they took a boat and went across the sea in the direction of Capernaum. By then it was dark and still Jesus had not come to them.";
B._Jhn6_18="The sea was getting rough because of a strong wind which was blowing.";
B._Jhn6_19="After they had gone three or four miles they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near to the boat; and they had great fear.";
B._Jhn6_20="But he said to them, It is I, have no fear.";
B._Jhn6_21="Then they readily took him into the boat: and straight away the boat was at the land to which they were going.";
B._Jhn6_22="The day after, the people who were on the other side of the sea saw that only one small boat had been there, that Jesus had not gone in that boat with the disciples, but that the disciples had gone away by themselves.";
B._Jhn6_23="Some other boats, however, came from Tiberias near to the place where they had taken the bread after the Lord had given praise.";
B._Jhn6_24="So when the people saw that Jesus was not there, or his disciples, they got into those boats and went over to Capernaum looking for Jesus.";
B._Jhn6_25="And when they came across him on the other side of the sea they said, Rabbi, when did you come here?";
B._Jhn6_26="Jesus, answering them, said, Truly I say to you, You come after me, not because you saw signs, but because you were given the bread and had enough.";
B._Jhn6_27="Let your work not be for the food which comes to an end, but for the food which goes on for eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you, for on him has God the Father put his mark.";
B._Jhn6_28="Then they said to him, How may we do the works of God?";
B._Jhn6_29="Jesus, answering, said to them, This is to do the work of God: to have faith in him whom God has sent.";
B._Jhn6_30="So they said, What sign do you give us, so that we may see and have faith in you? What do you do?";
B._Jhn6_31="Our fathers had the manna in the waste land, as the Writings say, He gave them bread from heaven.";
B._Jhn6_32="Jesus then said to them, Truly I say to you, What Moses gave you was not the bread from heaven; it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.";
B._Jhn6_33="The bread of God is the bread which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.";
B._Jhn6_34="Ah, Lord, they said, give us that bread for ever!";
B._Jhn6_35="And this was the answer of Jesus: I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never be in need of food, and he who has faith in me will never be in need of drink.";
B._Jhn6_36="But it is as I said to you: you have seen me, and still you have no faith.";
B._Jhn6_37="Whatever the Father gives to me will come to me; and I will not send away anyone who comes to me.";
B._Jhn6_38="For I have come down from heaven, not to do my pleasure, but the pleasure of him who sent me.";
B._Jhn6_39="And this is the pleasure of him who sent me, that I am not to let out of my hands anything which he has given me, but I am to give it new life on the last day.";
B._Jhn6_40="This, I say, is my Father's pleasure, that everyone who sees the Son and has faith in him may have eternal life: and I will take him up on the last day.";
B._Jhn6_41="Now the Jews said bitter things about Jesus because of his words, I am the bread which came down from heaven.";
B._Jhn6_42="And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we have seen? How is it then that he now says, I have come down from heaven?";
