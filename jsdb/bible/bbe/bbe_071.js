B._2Ch17_9="And they gave teaching in Judah and had the book of the law of the Lord with them; they went through all the towns of Judah teaching the people.";
B._2Ch17_10="And the fear of the Lord was on all the kingdoms of the lands round Judah, so that they made no wars against Jehoshaphat.";
B._2Ch17_11="And some of the Philistines took offerings to Jehoshaphat, and made him payments of silver; and the Arabians gave him flocks, seven thousand, seven hundred sheep, and seven thousand, seven hundred he-goats.";
B._2Ch17_12="Jehoshaphat became greater and greater, and made strong towers and store-towns in Judah.";
B._2Ch17_13="He had much property in the towns of Judah; he had forces of armed men, great and strong, in Jerusalem.";
B._2Ch17_14="This is the number of them, listed by their families, the captains of thousands of Judah: Adnah, the captain, and with him three hundred thousand men of war;";
B._2Ch17_15="Second to him Jehohanan, the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand;";
B._2Ch17_16="After him Amasiah, the son of Zichri, who freely gave himself to the Lord, and with him two hundred thousand men of war;";
B._2Ch17_17="And the captains of Benjamin: Eliada, a great man of war, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bows and body-covers;";
B._2Ch17_18="And after him Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and eighty thousand trained for war.";
B._2Ch17_19="These were the men who were waiting on the king, in addition to those placed by the king in the walled towns through all Judah.";
B._2Ch18_1="Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honour, and his son was married to Ahab's daughter.";
B._2Ch18_2="And after some years he went down to Samaria to see Ahab. And Ahab made a feast for him and the people who were with him, putting to death great numbers of sheep and oxen; and he got Jehoshaphat to go with him to Ramoth-gilead.";
B._2Ch18_3="For Ahab, king of Israel, said to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he said, I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will be with you in the war.";
B._2Ch18_4="Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Let us now get directions from the Lord.";
B._2Ch18_5="So the king of Israel got together all the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, Am I to go to Ramoth-gilead to make war or not? And they said, Go up: for God will give it into the hands of the king.";
B._2Ch18_6="But Jehoshaphat said, Is there no other prophet of the Lord here from whom we may get directions?";
B._2Ch18_7="And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is still one man by whom we may get directions from the Lord, but I have no love for him, because he has never been a prophet of good to me, but only of evil: he is Micaiah, the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.";
B._2Ch18_8="Then the king of Israel sent for one of his unsexed servants and said, Go quickly and come back with Micaiah, the son of Imla.";
B._2Ch18_9="Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were seated on their seats of authority, dressed in their robes, by the doorway into Samaria; and all the prophets were acting as prophets before them.";
B._2Ch18_10="And Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made himself iron horns and said, The Lord says, Pushing back the Aramaeans with these, you will put an end to them completely.";
B._2Ch18_11="And all the prophets said the same thing, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and it will go well for you, for the Lord will give it into the hands of the king.";
B._2Ch18_12="Now the servant who had gone to get Micaiah said to him, See now, all the prophets with one voice are saying good things to the king; so let your words be like theirs, and say good things.";
B._2Ch18_13="And Micaiah said, By the living Lord, whatever the Lord says to me I will say.";
B._2Ch18_14="When he came to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, are we to go to Ramoth-gilead to make war or not? And he said, Go up, and it will go well for you; and they will be given up into your hands.";
B._2Ch18_15="And the king said to him, Have I not, again and again, put you on your oath to say nothing to me but what is true in the name of the Lord?";
B._2Ch18_16="Then he said, I saw all Israel wandering on the mountains like sheep without a keeper; and the Lord said, These have no master: let them go back, every man to his house in peace.";
B._2Ch18_17="And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not say that he would not be a prophet of good to me, but of evil?";
B._2Ch18_18="Then he said, Give ear now to the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord seated on his seat of power, and all the army of heaven in their places, at his right hand and at his left.";
B._2Ch18_19="And the Lord said, How may Ahab, king of Israel, be tricked into going up to Ramoth-gilead to his death? And one said one thing and one another.";
B._2Ch18_20="Then a spirit came forward and took his place before the Lord and said, I will get him to do it by a trick. And the Lord said to him, How?";
B._2Ch18_21="And he said, I will go out and be a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Your trick will have its effect on him: go out and do so.";
B._2Ch18_22="And now, see, the Lord has put a spirit of deceit in the mouth of these prophets of yours; and the Lord has said evil against you.";
B._2Ch18_23="Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, came near and gave Micaiah a blow on the side of his face, saying, Where is the spirit of the Lord whose word is in you?";
B._2Ch18_24="And Micaiah said, Truly, you will see on that day when you go into an inner room to keep yourself safe.";
B._2Ch18_25="And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon, the ruler of the town, and to Joash, the king's son;";
B._2Ch18_26="And say, By the king's order this man is to be put in prison, and given prison food till I come back in peace.";
B._2Ch18_27="And Micaiah said, If you come back at all in peace, the Lord has not sent his word by me.";
B._2Ch18_28="So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramoth-gilead.";
B._2Ch18_29="And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will make a change in my clothing, so that I do not seem to be the king, and will go into the fight; but do you put on your robes. So the king of Israel made a change in his dress, and they went to the fight.";
B._2Ch18_30="Now the king of Aram had given orders to the captains of his war-carriages, saying, Make no attack on small or great, but only on the king of Israel.";
B._2Ch18_31="So when the captains of the war-carriages saw Jehoshaphat, they said, It is the king of Israel. And turning about, they came round him, but Jehoshaphat gave a cry, and the Lord came to his help, and God sent them away from him.";
B._2Ch18_32="Now when the captains of the war-carriages saw that he was not the king of Israel, they went back from going after him.";
B._2Ch18_33="And a certain man sent an arrow from his bow without thought of its direction, and gave the king of Israel a wound where his breastplate was joined to his clothing; so he said to the driver of his war-carriage, Go to one side and take me away out of the army, for I am badly wounded.";
B._2Ch18_34="But the fight became more violent while the day went on; and the king of Israel was supported in his war-carriage facing the Aramaeans till the evening; and by sundown he was dead.";
B._2Ch19_1="And Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, went back to his house in Jerusalem in peace.";
B._2Ch19_2="And Jehu, the son of Hanani the seer, went to King Jehoshaphat and said to him, Is it right for you to go to the help of evil-doers, loving the haters of the Lord? because of this, the wrath of the Lord has come on you.";
B._2Ch19_3="But still there is some good in you, for you have put away the wood pillars out of the land, and have given your heart to the worship of God.";
B._2Ch19_4="And Jehoshaphat was living in Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people, from Beer-sheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, guiding them back to the Lord, the God of their fathers.";
B._2Ch19_5="And he put judges through all the land, in every walled town of Judah,";
B._2Ch19_6="And said to the judges, Take care what you do, for you are judging not for man but for the Lord, and he is with you in the decisions you give.";
B._2Ch19_7="So now let the fear of the Lord be in you; do your work with care; for in the Lord our God there is no evil, or respect for high position, or taking of payment to do wrong.";
B._2Ch19_8="Then in Jerusalem he gave authority to certain of the Levites and the priests and the heads of families of Israel to give decisions for the Lord, and in the causes of those living in Jerusalem.";
B._2Ch19_9="And he gave them their orders, saying, You are to do your work in the fear of the Lord, in good faith and with a true heart.";
B._2Ch19_10="And if any cause comes before you from your brothers living in their towns, where the death punishment is in question, or where there are questions of law or order, or rules or decisions, make them take care that they are not in the wrong before the Lord, so that wrath may not come on you and on your brothers; do this and you yourselves will not be in the wrong.";
B._2Ch19_11="And now, Amariah, the chief priest, is over you in all questions to do with the Lord; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the head of the family of Judah, in everything to do with the king's business; and the Levites will be overseers for you. Be strong to do the work; and may the Lord be with the upright.";
B._2Ch20_1="Now after this, the children of Moab and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Meunim, made war against Jehoshaphat.";
B._2Ch20_2="And they came to Jehoshaphat with the news, saying, A great army is moving against you from Edom across the sea; and now they are in Hazazon-tamar (which is En-gedi).";
B._2Ch20_3="Then Jehoshaphat, in his fear, went to the Lord for directions, and gave orders all through Judah for the people to go without food.";
B._2Ch20_4="And Judah came together to make prayer for help from the Lord; from every town of Judah they came to give worship to the Lord.";
B._2Ch20_5="And Jehoshaphat took his place in the meeting of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord in front of the new open space,";
B._2Ch20_6="And said, O Lord, the God of our fathers, are you not God in heaven? are you not ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? and in your hands are power and strength so that no one is able to keep his place against you.";
B._2Ch20_7="Did you not, O Lord our God, after driving out the people of this land before your people Israel, give it to the seed of Abraham, your friend, for ever?";
B._2Ch20_8="And they made it their living-place, building there a holy house for your name, and saying,";
B._2Ch20_9="If evil comes on us, the sword, or punishment, or disease, or need of food, we will come to this house and to you, (for your name is in this house,) crying to you in our trouble, and you will give us salvation in answer to our cry.";
B._2Ch20_10="And now, see, the children of Ammon and Moab and the people of Mount Seir, whom you kept Israel from attacking when they came out of Egypt, so that turning to one side they did not send destruction on them:";
B._2Ch20_11="See now, how as our reward they have come to send us out of your land which you have given us as our heritage.";
B._2Ch20_12="O our God, will you not be their judge? for our strength is not equal to this great army which is coming against us; and we are at a loss what to do: but our eyes are on you.";
B._2Ch20_13="And all Judah were waiting before the Lord, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.";
B._2Ch20_14="Then, before all the meeting, the spirit of the Lord came on Jahaziel, the son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, a Levite and one of the family of Asaph;";
B._2Ch20_15="And he said, Give ear, O Judah, and you people of Jerusalem, and you, King Jehoshaphat: the Lord says to you, Have no fear and do not be troubled on account of this great army; for the fight is not yours but God's.";
B._2Ch20_16="Go down against them tomorrow: see, they are coming up by the slope of Ziz; at the end of the valley, before the waste land of Jeruel, you will come face to face with them.";
B._2Ch20_17="There will be no need for you to take up arms in this fight; put yourselves in position, and keep where you are, and you will see the salvation of the Lord with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: have no fear and do not be troubled: go out against them tomorrow, for the Lord is with you.";
B._2Ch20_18="Then Jehoshaphat went down with his face to the earth, and all Judah and the people of Jerusalem gave worship to the Lord, falling down before him.";
B._2Ch20_19="And the Levites, the children of the Kohathites and the Korahites, got to their feet and gave praise to the Lord, the God of Israel, with a loud voice.";
B._2Ch20_20="And early in the morning they got up and went out to the waste land of Tekoa: and when they were going out, Jehoshaphat took his station and said to them, Give ear to me, O Judah and you people of Jerusalem: have faith in the Lord your God and you will be safe; have faith in his prophets and all will go well for you.";
B._2Ch20_21="And after discussion with the people, he put in their places those who were to make melody to the Lord, praising him in holy robes, while they went at the head of the army, and saying, May the Lord be praised, for his mercy is unchanging for ever.";
B._2Ch20_22="And at the first notes of song and praise the Lord sent a surprise attack against the children of Ammon and Moab and the people of Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were overcome.";
B._2Ch20_23="And the children of Ammon and Moab made an attack on the people of Mount Seir with a view to their complete destruction; and when they had put an end to the people of Seir, everyman's hand was turned against his neighbour for his destruction.";
B._2Ch20_24="And Judah came to the watchtower of the waste land, and looking in the direction of the army, they saw only dead bodies stretched on the earth; no living man was to be seen.";
B._2Ch20_25="And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their goods from them, they saw beasts in great numbers, and wealth and clothing and things of value, more than they were able to take away; all this they took for themselves, and they were three days getting it away, there was so much.";
B._2Ch20_26="On the fourth day they all came together in the Valley of Blessing, and there they gave blessing to the Lord; for which cause that place has been named the Valley of Blessing to this day.";
B._2Ch20_27="Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem went back, with Jehoshaphat at their head, coming back to Jerusalem with joy; for the Lord had made them glad over their haters.";
B._2Ch20_28="So they came to Jerusalem with corded instruments and wind-instruments into the house of the Lord.";
B._2Ch20_29="And the fear of God came on all the kingdoms of the lands, when they had news of how the Lord made war on those who came against Israel.";
B._2Ch20_30="So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for the Lord gave him rest on every side.";
B._2Ch20_31="And Jehoshaphat was king over Judah: he was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he was ruling for twenty-five years in Jerusalem: his mother's name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.";
B._2Ch20_32="He went in the ways of his father Asa, not turning away, but doing right in the eyes of the Lord.";
B._2Ch20_33="The high places, however, were not taken away, and the hearts of the people were still not true to the God of their fathers.";
B._2Ch20_34="Now as for the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, they are recorded in the words of Jehu, the son of Hanani, which were put in the book of the kings of Israel.";
B._2Ch20_35="After this Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, became friends with Ahaziah, king of Israel, who did much evil:";
B._2Ch20_36="Together they made ships to go to Tarshish, building them in Ezion-geber.";
B._2Ch20_37="Then the word of Eliezer the prophet, the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah, came against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because you have let yourself be joined with Ahaziah, the Lord has sent destruction on your works. And the ships were broken and were not able to go to Tarshish.";
B._2Ch21_1="And Jehoshaphat went to rest with his fathers, and his body was put into the earth in the town of David. And Jehoram his son became king in his place.";
B._2Ch21_2="And he had brothers, sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel.";
B._2Ch21_3="And their father gave them much silver and gold and things of great value, as well as walled towns in Judah; but the kingdom he gave to Jehoram, because he was the oldest.";
B._2Ch21_4="Now when Jehoram had taken his place over his father's kingdom, and had made his position safe, he put all his brothers to death with the sword, as well as some of the princes of Israel.";
B._2Ch21_5="Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for eight years.";
B._2Ch21_6="He went in the ways of the kings of Israel, and did as the family of Ahab did, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the eyes of the Lord.";
B._2Ch21_7="But it was not the Lord's purpose to send destruction on the family of David, because of the agreement he had made with David, when he said he would give to him and to his sons a light for ever.";
B._2Ch21_8="In his time Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah, and took a king for themselves.";
B._2Ch21_9="Then Jehoram went over with his captains and all his war-carriages ... made an attack by night on the Edomites, whose forces were all round him ... on the captains of the war-carriages.";
B._2Ch21_10="So Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah, to this day: and at the same time Libnah made itself free from his rule; because he was turned away from the Lord, the God of his fathers.";
B._2Ch21_11="And more than this, he made high places in the mountains of Judah, teaching the people of Jerusalem to go after false gods, and guiding Judah away from the true way.";
B._2Ch21_12="And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, The Lord, the God of your father David, says, Because you have not kept to the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or the ways of Asa, king of Judah,";
B._2Ch21_13="But have gone in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the people of Jerusalem go after false gods, as the family of Ahab did: and because you have put to death your father's sons, your brothers, who were better than yourself:";
B._2Ch21_14="Now, truly, the Lord will send a great destruction on your people and your children and your wives and everything which is yours:";
B._2Ch21_15="And you yourself will undergo the cruel pains of a disease in your stomach, so that day by day your inside will be falling out because of the disease.";
B._2Ch21_16="Then the Philistines and the Arabians, who are by Ethiopia, were moved by the Lord to make war on Jehoram;";
B._2Ch21_17="And they came up against Judah, forcing a way into it, and took away all the goods in the king's house, as well as his sons and his wives; so that he had no son but only Jehoahaz, the youngest.";
B._2Ch21_18="And after all this the Lord sent on him a disease of the stomach from which it was impossible for him to be made well.";
B._2Ch21_19="And time went on, and after two years, his inside falling out because of the disease, he came to his death in cruel pain. And his people made no burning for him like the burning made for his fathers.";
B._2Ch21_20="He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for eight years: and at his death he was not regretted; they put his body into the earth in the town of David, but not in the resting-place of the kings.";
B._2Ch22_1="And the people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, for the band of men who came with the Arabians to the army had put all the older sons to death. So Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, became king.";
B._2Ch22_2="Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for one year. His mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri.";
B._2Ch22_3="He went in the ways of the family of Ahab, for his mother was his teacher in evil-doing.";
B._2Ch22_4="And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as the family of Ahab did; for after the death of his father they were his guides to his destruction.";
B._2Ch22_5="Acting on their suggestion, he went with Jehoram, son of Ahab, king of Israel, to make war on Hazael, king of Aram, at Ramoth-gilead: and Joram was wounded by the bowmen.";
B._2Ch22_6="And he went back to Jezreel to get well from the wounds which they had given him at Ramah when he was fighting against Hazael, king of Aram. And Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to Jezreel to see Jehoram, the son of Ahab, because he was ill.";
B._2Ch22_7="Now by the purpose of God, Ahaziah's journey to see Jehoram was the cause of his downfall: for when he came there, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu, the son of Nimshi, who had been marked out by the Lord for the destruction of the family of Ahab.";
B._2Ch22_8="Now when Jehu was effecting the punishment of the family of Ahab, he came to the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's brothers, the servants of Ahaziah, and put them to death.";
B._2Ch22_9="And he went in search of Ahaziah; and when they came where he was, (for he was in a secret place in Samaria,) they took him to Jehu and put him to death; then they put his body to rest in the earth, for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, whose heart was true to the Lord. So the family of Ahaziah had no power to keep the kingdom.";
B._2Ch22_10="Now when Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was dead, she had all the rest of the seed of the kingdom of Judah put to death.";
B._2Ch22_11="But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, secretly took Joash, the son of Ahaziah, away from among the king's sons who were put to death, and put him and the woman who took care of him in a bedroom.

B._2Ch23_1="In the seventh year, Jehoiada made himself strong, and made an agreement with the captains of hundreds, Azariah, the son of Jeroham, Ishmael, the son of Jehohanan, Azariah, the son of Obed, Maaseiah, the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat, the son of Zichri.";
B._2Ch23_2="And they went through Judah, getting together the Levites and the heads of families in Israel from all the towns of Judah, and they came to Jerusalem.";
B._2Ch23_3="And all the people made an agreement with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, Truly, the king's son will be king, as the Lord has said about the sons of David.";

B._2Ch23_8="So the Levites and all Judah did as Jehoiada the priest had given them orders: every one took with him his men, those who were to come in and those who were to go out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada had not sent away the divisions.";
B._2Ch23_9="Then Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and body-covers which had been King David's and which were kept in the house of God.";
B._2Ch23_10="And he put all the people in position, every man with his instruments of war in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left, by the altar and the house and all round the king.";
B._2Ch23_11="Then they made the king's son come out, and they put the crown on his head and gave him the arm-bands and made him king: and Jehoiada and his sons put the holy oil on him and said, Long life to the king.";
