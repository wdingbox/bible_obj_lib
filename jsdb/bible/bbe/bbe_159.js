B._Jhn20_10="So then the disciples went away again to their houses.";
B._Jhn20_11="But Mary was still there outside the hole in the rock, weeping; and while she was weeping and looking into the hole,";
B._Jhn20_12="She saw two angels in white seated where the body of Jesus had been, one at the head and the other at the feet.";
B._Jhn20_13="They said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I have no knowledge where they have put him.";
B._Jhn20_14="And then looking round, she saw Jesus there, but had no idea that it was Jesus.";
B._Jhn20_15="Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? who are you looking for? She, taking him for the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have taken him away from here, say where you have put him and I will take him away.";
B._Jhn20_16="Jesus said to her, Mary! Turning, she said to him in Hebrew, Rabboni! (which is to say, Master).";
B._Jhn20_17="Jesus said to her, Do not put your hand on me, for I have not gone up to the Father: but go to my brothers and say to them, I go up to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.";
B._Jhn20_18="Mary Magdalene went with the news to the disciples, and said she had seen the Lord and that he had said these things to her.";
B._Jhn20_19="At evening on that day, the first day of the week, when, for fear of the Jews, the doors were shut where the disciples were, Jesus came among them and said to them, May peace be with you!";
B._Jhn20_20="And when he had said this, he let them see his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.";
B._Jhn20_21="And Jesus said to them again, May peace be with you! As the Father sent me, even so I now send you.";
B._Jhn20_22="And when he had said this, breathing on them, he said to them, Let the Holy Spirit come on you:";
B._Jhn20_23="Any to whom you give forgiveness, will be made free from their sins; and any from whom you keep back forgiveness, will still be in their sins.";
B._Jhn20_24="Now Thomas, one of the twelve, named Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.";
B._Jhn20_25="So the other disciples said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, If I do not see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails, and if I do not put my hand into his side, I will never have belief.";
B._Jhn20_26="And after eight days, his disciples were again in the house and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were shut, Jesus came, and taking his place in the middle of them, he said, May peace be with you!";
B._Jhn20_27="Then he said to Thomas, Put out your finger, and see my hands; and put your hand here into my side: and be no longer in doubt but have belief.";
B._Jhn20_28="And Thomas said in answer, My Lord and my God!";
B._Jhn20_29="Jesus said to him, Because you have seen me you have belief: a blessing will be on those who have belief though they have not seen me!";
B._Jhn20_30="A number of other signs Jesus did before his disciples which are not recorded in this book:";
B._Jhn20_31="But these are recorded, so that you may have faith that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that, having this faith you may have life in his name.";
B._Jhn21_1="After these things Jesus let himself be seen again by the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and it came about in this way.";
B._Jhn21_2="Simon Peter, Thomas named Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were all together.";
B._Jhn21_3="Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing. They said to him, And we will come with you. They went out and got into the boat; but that night they took no fish.";
B._Jhn21_4="Now very early in the morning Jesus was there by the edge of the sea (though the disciples were not conscious that it was Jesus).";
B._Jhn21_5="So Jesus said to them, Children, have you taken any fish? They made answer, No.";
B._Jhn21_6="And he said to them, Let down the net on the right side of the boat and you will get some. So they put it in the water and now they were not able to get it up again because of the great number of fish.";
B._Jhn21_7="So the disciple who was dear to Jesus said to Peter, It is the Lord! Hearing that it was the Lord, Peter put his coat round him (because he was not clothed) and went into the sea.";
B._Jhn21_8="And the other disciples came in the little boat (they were not far from land, only about two hundred cubits off) pulling the net full of fish.";
B._Jhn21_9="When they got to land, they saw a fire of coals there, with fish cooking on it, and bread.";
B._Jhn21_10="Jesus said to them, Get some of the fish which you have now taken.";
B._Jhn21_11="So Peter went to the boat and came back pulling the net to land, full of great fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there was such a number the net was not broken.";
B._Jhn21_12="Jesus said to them, Come and take some food. And all the disciples were in fear of putting the question, Who are you? being conscious that it was the Lord.";
B._Jhn21_13="Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish in the same way.";
B._Jhn21_14="Now this was the third time that Jesus let himself be seen by the disciples after he had come back from the dead.";
B._Jhn21_15="Then when they had taken food, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, is your love for me greater than the love of these others? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you are certain of my love for you. He said to him, Then give my lambs food.";
B._Jhn21_16="Again, a second time, he said to him, Simon, son of John, have you any love for me? Yes, Lord, he said, you are certain of my love for you. Then take care of my sheep, said Jesus.";
B._Jhn21_17="He said to him a third time, Simon, son of John, am I dear to you? Now Peter was troubled in his heart because he put the question a third time, Am I dear to you? And he said to him, Lord, you have knowledge of all things; you see that you are dear to me. Jesus said to him, Then give my sheep food.";
B._Jhn21_18="Truly I say to you, When you were young, you made yourself ready and went wherever you had a desire to go: but when you are old, you will put out your hands and another will make you ready, and you will be taken where you have no desire to go.";
B._Jhn21_19="Now this he said, pointing out the sort of death by which he would give God glory. And after saying this, he said to him, Come after me.";
B._Jhn21_20="Then Peter, turning round, saw the disciple who was dear to Jesus coming after them--the disciple who was resting on his breast at the last meal, and said, Lord, who is it who will be false to you?";
B._Jhn21_21="Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, What about this man?";
B._Jhn21_22="Jesus said to him, If it is my desire for him to be here till I come back, what is that to you? come yourself after me.";
B._Jhn21_23="So this saying went about among the brothers that this disciple would not undergo death: Jesus, however, did not say that he would not undergo death, but, If it is my desire for him to be here till I come back, what is that to you?";
B._Jhn21_24="This is the disciple who gives witness about these things and who put them in writing: and we have knowledge that his witness is true.";
B._Jhn21_25="And Jesus did such a number of other things that, if every one was recorded, it is my opinion that even the world itself is not great enough for the books there would be.";
B._Act1_1="I have given an earlier account, O Theophilus, of all the things which Jesus did, and of his teaching from the first,";
B._Act1_2="Till the day when he was taken up to heaven after he had given his orders, through the Holy Spirit, to the Apostles of whom he had made selection:";
B._Act1_3="And to whom he gave clear and certain signs that he was living, after his death; for he was seen by them for forty days, and gave them teaching about the kingdom of God:";
B._Act1_4="And when they were all together, with him, he gave them orders not to go away from Jerusalem, but to keep there, waiting till the word of the Father was put into effect, of which, he said, I have given you knowledge:";
B._Act1_5="For the baptism of John was with water, but you will have baptism with the Holy Spirit, after a little time.";
B._Act1_6="So, when they were together, they said to him, Lord, will you at this time give back the kingdom to Israel?";
B._Act1_7="And he said to them, It is not for you to have knowledge of the time and the order of events which the Father has kept in his control.";
B._Act1_8="But you will have power, when the Holy Spirit has come on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judaea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.";
B._Act1_9="And when he had said these things, while they were looking, he was taken up, and went from their view into a cloud.";
B._Act1_10="And while they were looking up to heaven with great attention, two men came to them, in white clothing,";
B._Act1_11="And said, O men of Galilee, why are you looking up into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken from you into heaven, will come again, in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.";
B._Act1_12="Then they went back to Jerusalem from the mountain named Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.";
B._Act1_13="And when they came in, they went up into the room where they were living; Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James, the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas, the son of James.";
B._Act1_14="And they all with one mind gave themselves up to prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.";
B._Act1_15="And in those days Peter got up among the brothers (there were about one hundred and twenty of them), and said,";
B._Act1_16="My brothers, the word of God had to be put into effect, which the Holy Spirit had said before, by the mouth of David, about Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus,";
B._Act1_17="For he was numbered among us, and had his part in our work.";
B._Act1_18="(Now this man, with the reward of his evil-doing, got for himself a field, and falling head first, came to a sudden and violent end there.";
B._Act1_19="And this came to the knowledge of all those who were living in Jerusalem, so that the field was named in their language, Akel-dama, or, The field of blood.)";
B._Act1_20="For in the book of Psalms it says, Let his house be waste, and let no man be living in it: and, Let his position be taken by another.";
B._Act1_21="For this reason, of the men who have been with us all the time, while the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,";
B._Act1_22="Starting from the baptism of John till he went up from us, one will have to be a witness with us of his coming back from death.";
B._Act1_23="And they made selection of two, Joseph, named Barsabbas, whose other name was Justus, and Matthias.";
B._Act1_24="And they made prayers and said, Lord, having knowledge of the hearts of all men, make clear which of these two has been marked out by you,";
B._Act1_25="To take that position as a servant and Apostle, from which Judas by his sin was shut out, so that he might go to his place.";
B._Act1_26="And they put it to the decision of chance, and the decision was given for Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven Apostles.";
B._Act2_1="And when the day of Pentecost was come, they were all together in one place.";
B._Act2_2="And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rushing of a violent wind, and all the house where they were was full of it.";
B._Act2_3="And they saw tongues, like flames of fire, coming to rest on every one of them.";
B._Act2_4="And they were all full of the Holy Spirit, and were talking in different languages, as the Spirit gave them power.";
B._Act2_5="Now there were living at Jerusalem, Jews, God-fearing men, from every nation under heaven.";
B._Act2_6="And when this sound came to their ears, they all came together, and were greatly surprised because every man was hearing the words of the disciples in his special language.";
B._Act2_7="And they were full of wonder and said, Are not all these men Galilaeans?";
B._Act2_8="And how is it that every one of us is hearing their words in the language which was ours from our birth?";
B._Act2_9="Men of Parthia, Media, and Elam, and those living in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,";
B._Act2_10="In Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and those who have come from Rome, Jews by birth and others who have become Jews,";
B._Act2_11="Men of Crete and Arabia, to all of us they are talking in our different languages, of the great works of God.";
B._Act2_12="And they were all surprised and in doubt saying to one another, What is the reason of this?";
B._Act2_13="But others, making sport of them, said, They are full of new wine.";
B._Act2_14="But Peter, getting up, with the eleven, said in a loud voice, O men of Judaea, and all you who are living in Jerusalem, take note of this and give ear to my words.";
B._Act2_15="For these men are not overcome with wine, as it seems to you, for it is only the third hour of the day;";
B._Act2_16="But this is the thing which was said by the prophet Joel;";
B._Act2_17="And it will come about, in the last days, says God, that I will send out my Spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters will be prophets, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will have dreams:";
B._Act2_18="And on my men-servants and my women-servants I will send my Spirit, and they will be prophets.";
B._Act2_19="And wonders will be seen in heaven, and signs on the earth, blood and fire and smoke:";
B._Act2_20="The sun will become dark and the moon will be turned to blood, before that great day of the Lord comes in glory:";
B._Act2_21="And whoever makes his prayer to the Lord will have salvation.";
B._Act2_22="Men of Israel, give ear to these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man who had the approval of God, as was made clear to you by the great works and signs and wonders which God did by him among you, as you yourselves have knowledge,";
B._Act2_23="Him, when he was given up, by the decision and knowledge of God, you put to death on the cross, by the hands of evil men:";
B._Act2_24="But God gave him back to life, having made him free from the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be overcome by it.";
B._Act2_25="For David said of him, I saw the Lord before my face at all times, for he is at my right hand, so that I may not be moved:";
B._Act2_26="And for this cause my heart was glad and my tongue full of joy, and my flesh will be resting in hope:";
B._Act2_27="For you will not let my soul be in hell and you will not give up your Holy One to destruction.";
B._Act2_28="You have made me see the ways of life; I will be full of joy when I see your face.";
B._Act2_29="My brothers, I may say to you openly that David came to his death, and was put in the earth, and his resting-place is with us today.";
B._Act2_30="But being a prophet, and having in mind the oath which God had given to him, that of the fruit of his body one would take his place as a king,";
B._Act2_31="He, having knowledge of the future, was talking of the coming again of Christ from the dead, that he was not kept in hell and his body did not see destruction.";
B._Act2_32="This Jesus God has given back to life, of which we all are witnesses.";
B._Act2_33="And so, being lifted up to the right hand of God, and having the Father's word that the Holy Spirit would come, he has sent this thing, which now you see and have knowledge of.";
B._Act2_34="For David has not gone up into heaven, but says, himself, The Lord said to my Lord, Be seated at my right hand,";
B._Act2_35="Till I put all those who are against you under your feet.";
B._Act2_36="For this reason, let all Israel be certain that this Jesus, whom you put to death on the cross, God has made Lord and Christ.";
B._Act2_37="Now when these words came to their ears their hearts were troubled, and they said to Peter and the other Apostles, Brothers, what are we to do?";
B._Act2_38="And Peter said, Let your hearts be changed, every one of you, and have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will have the Holy Spirit given to you.";
B._Act2_39="For the word of God is for you and for your children and for all those who are far off, even all those who may be marked out by the Lord our God.";
B._Act2_40="And with more such words he gave his witness, offering them salvation and saying, Come out from this evil generation.";
B._Act2_41="Then those who gave hearing to his words had baptism: and about three thousand souls were joined to them that day.";
B._Act2_42="And they kept their attention fixed on the Apostles' teaching and were united together in the taking of broken bread and in prayer.";
B._Act2_43="But fear came on every soul: and all sorts of wonders and signs were done by the Apostles.";
B._Act2_44="And all those who were of the faith kept together, and had all things in common;";
B._Act2_45="And exchanging their goods and property for money, they made division of it among them all, as they had need.";
B._Act2_46="And day by day, going in agreement together regularly to the Temple and, taking broken bread together in their houses, they took their food with joy and with true hearts,";
B._Act2_47="Giving praise to God, and having the approval of all the people; and every day the number of those who had salvation was increased by the Lord.";
B._Act3_1="Now Peter and John were going up to the Temple at the ninth hour, the hour of prayer;";
B._Act3_2="And a certain man who from birth had had no power in his legs, was taken there every day, and put down at the door of the Temple which is named Beautiful, requesting money from those who went into the Temple;";
B._Act3_3="He then, seeing Peter and John going into the Temple, made a request to them.";
B._Act3_4="And Peter, looking at him, with John, said, Keep your eyes on us.";
B._Act3_5="And he gave attention to them, hoping to get something from them.";
B._Act3_6="But Peter said, I have no silver or gold, but what I have, that I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up on your feet.";
B._Act3_7="And he took him by his right hand, lifting him up; and straight away his feet and the bones of his legs became strong,";
B._Act3_8="And, jumping up, he got on to his feet and went into the Temple with them, walking and jumping and giving praise to God.";
B._Act3_9="And all the people saw him walking and praising God:";
B._Act3_10="And they saw that it was the man who made requests for money at the door of the Temple, and they were full of wonder and surprise at what had taken place.";
B._Act3_11="And while he kept his hands on Peter and John, all the people came running together to the covered way which is named Solomon's, full of wonder.";
B._Act3_12="And when Peter saw it he said to the people, You men of Israel, why are you so greatly surprised at this man? or why are you looking at us as if by our power or virtue we had given him the use of his legs?";
B._Act3_13="The God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has given glory to his servant Jesus; whom you gave up, turning your backs on him, when Pilate had made the decision to let him go free.";
B._Act3_14="But you would have nothing to do with the Holy and Upright One, and made request for a man of blood to be given to you,";
B._Act3_15="And put to death the Lord of life; whom God gave back from the dead; of which fact we are witnesses.";
B._Act3_16="And his name, through faith in his name, has made this man strong, whom you see and have knowledge of: yes, the faith which is through him has made him well, before you all.";
B._Act3_17="And now, my brothers, I am conscious that you did this, as did your rulers, without knowledge.";
B._Act3_18="But the things which God had made clear before, by the mouth of all the prophets, that the Christ would have to undergo, he has put into effect in this way.";
B._Act3_19="So then, let your hearts be changed and be turned to God, so that your sins may be completely taken away, and times of blessing may come from the Lord;";
B._Act3_20="And that he may send the Christ who was marked out for you from the first, even Jesus:";
B._Act3_21="Who is to be kept in heaven till the time when all things are put right, of which God has given word by the mouth of his holy prophets, who have been from the earliest times.";
B._Act3_22="For Moses said, The Lord will give you a prophet from among your people, like me; you will give ear to everything which he will say to you.";
B._Act3_23="And every soul who does not give attention to that prophet, will be cut off from among the people.";
B._Act3_24="And all the prophets from Samuel and those who came after, every one of them, gave word of these days.";
B._Act3_25="You are the sons of the prophets, and of the agreement which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, Through your seed a blessing will come on all the families of the earth.";
B._Act3_26="To you, first, God sent his servant, blessing you by turning every one of you from his sins.";
B._Act4_1="And while they were talking to the people, the priests and the captain of the Temple and the Sadducees came up to them,";
B._Act4_2="Being greatly troubled because they were teaching the people and preaching Jesus as an example of the coming back from the dead.";
B._Act4_3="And they took them and put them in prison till the morning, for it was now evening.";
B._Act4_4="But a number of those who gave hearing to the word had faith; and they were now about five thousand.";
B._Act4_5="And on the day after, the rulers and those in authority and the scribes came together in Jerusalem;";
B._Act4_6="And Annas, the high priest, was there, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all the relations of the high priest.";
B._Act4_7="Then sending for Peter and John, they said, By what power and in whose name have you done this?";
B._Act4_8="Then Peter, being full of the Holy Spirit, said to them, O you rulers of the people and men of authority,";
B._Act4_9="If we are questioned today about a good work done to a man who was ill, as to how he has been made well,";
B._Act4_10="Take note, all of you, and all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you put to death on the cross, whom God gave back from the dead, even through him is this man now before you completely well.";
B._Act4_11="He is the stone which you builders had no use for, but which has been made the chief stone of the building.";
B._Act4_12="And in no other is there salvation: for there is no other name under heaven, given among men, through which we may have salvation.";
B._Act4_13="Now when they saw that Peter and John were without fear, though they were men of no education or learning, they were greatly surprised; and they took note of them that they had been with Jesus.";
B._Act4_14="And, seeing that the man who had been made well was there with them, they were not able to say anything against it.";
B._Act4_15="But when they had given them orders to go out of the Sanhedrin, they had a discussion among themselves,";
B._Act4_16="Saying, What are we to do with these men? for certainly it is clear to all who are living in Jerusalem that a most important sign has been done by them, and it is not possible to say that it is not so.";
B._Act4_17="But so that it may not go farther among the people, let us put them in fear of punishment if they say anything in future in this name.";
B._Act4_18="And they sent for them, and gave them orders not to make statements or give teaching in the name of Jesus.";
B._Act4_19="But Peter and John in answer said to them, It is for you to say if it is right in the eyes of God to give attention to you more than to God:";
B._Act4_20="For it is not possible for us to keep from saying what we have seen and have knowledge of.";
B._Act4_21="And when they had said more sharp words to them, they let them go, not seeing what punishment they might give them, because of the people; for all men were giving praise to God for what had taken place.";
B._Act4_22="For the man on whom this act of power was done was more than forty years old.";
B._Act4_23="And when they had been made free, they came back to their friends, and gave an account of all the things which the chief priests and the authorities had said to them.";
B._Act4_24="And hearing it, they all, with one mind, made prayer to God and said, O Lord, maker of heaven and earth and the sea and all things in them:";
B._Act4_25="Who has said, by the Holy Spirit, through the mouth of our father David your servant, Why are the nations so violently moved, and why are the thoughts of the people so foolish?";
B._Act4_26="The kings of the earth were lifted up, the rulers came together, against the Lord, and against his Christ:";
B._Act4_27="For, truly, in this town, against your holy servant, Jesus, who was marked out by you as Christ, Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, came together,";
