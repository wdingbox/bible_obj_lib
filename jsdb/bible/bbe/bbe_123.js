B._Eze16_6="And when I went past you and saw you stretched out in your blood, I said to you, Though you are stretched out in your blood, have life;";
B._Eze16_7="And be increased in number like the buds of the field; and you were increased and became great, and you came to the time of love: your breasts were formed and your hair was long; but you were uncovered and without clothing.";
B._Eze16_8="Now when I went past you, looking at you, I saw that your time was the time of love; and I put my skirts over you, covering your unclothed body: and I gave you my oath and made an agreement with you, says the Lord, and you became mine.";
B._Eze16_9="Then I had you washed with water, washing away all your blood and rubbing you with oil.";
B._Eze16_10="And I had you clothed with needlework, and put leather shoes on your feet, folding fair linen about you and covering you with silk.";
B._Eze16_11="And I made you fair with ornaments and put jewels on your hands and a chain on your neck.";
B._Eze16_12="And I put a ring in your nose and ear-rings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.";
B._Eze16_13="So you were made beautiful with gold and silver; and your clothing was of the best linen and silk and needlework; your food was the best meal and honey and oil: and you were very beautiful.";
B._Eze16_14="You were so beautiful that the story of you went out into all nations; you were completely beautiful because of my glory which I had put on you, says the Lord.";
B._Eze16_15="But you put your faith in the fact that you were beautiful, acting like a loose woman because you were widely talked of, and offering your cheap love to everyone who went by, whoever it might be.";
B._Eze16_16="And you took your robes and made high places for yourself ornamented with every colour, acting like a loose woman on them, without shame or fear.";
B._Eze16_17="And you took the fair jewels, my silver and gold which I had given to you, and made for yourself male images, acting like a loose woman with them;";
B._Eze16_18="And you took your robes of needlework for their clothing, and put my oil and my perfume before them.";
B._Eze16_19="And my bread which I gave you, the best meal and oil and honey which I gave you for your food, you put it before them for a sweet smell, says the Lord.";
B._Eze16_20="And you took your sons and your daughters whom I had by you, offering even these to them to be their food. Was your loose behaviour so small a thing,";
B._Eze16_21="That you put my children to death and gave them up to go through the fire to them?";
B._Eze16_22="And in all your disgusting and false behaviour you had no memory of your early days, when you were uncovered and without clothing, stretched out in your blood.";
B._Eze16_23="And it came about, after all your evil-doing, says the Lord,";
B._Eze16_24="That you made for yourself an arched room in every open place.";
B._Eze16_25="You put up your high places at the top of every street, and made the grace of your form a disgusting thing, opening your feet to everyone who went by, increasing your loose ways.";
B._Eze16_26="And you went with the Egyptians, your neighbours, great of flesh; increasing your loose ways, moving me to wrath.";
B._Eze16_27="Now, then, my hand is stretched out against you, cutting down your fixed amount, and I have given you up to the desire of your haters, the daughters of the Philistines who are shamed by your loose ways.";
B._Eze16_28="And you went with the Assyrians, because of your desire which was without measure; you were acting like a loose woman with them, and still you had not enough.";
B._Eze16_29="And you went on in your loose ways, even as far as the land of Chaldaea, and still you had not enough.";
B._Eze16_30="How feeble is your heart, says the Lord, seeing that you do all these things, the work of a loose and overruling woman;";
B._Eze16_31="For you have made your arched room at the top of every street, and your high place in every open place; though you were not like a loose woman in getting together your payment.";
B._Eze16_32="The untrue wife who takes strange lovers in place of her husband!";
B._Eze16_33="They give payment to all loose women: but you give rewards to your lovers, offering them payment so that they may come to you on every side for your cheap love.";
B._Eze16_34="And in your loose behaviour you are different from other women, for no one goes after you to make love to you: and because you give payment and no payment is given to you, in this you are different from them.";
B._Eze16_35="For this cause, O loose woman, give ear to the voice of the Lord:";
B._Eze16_36="This is what the Lord has said: Because your unclean behaviour was let loose and your body uncovered in your loose ways with your lovers and with your disgusting images, and for the blood of your children which you gave to them;";
B._Eze16_37="For this cause I will get together all your lovers with whom you have taken your pleasure, and all those to whom you have given your love, with all those who were hated by you; I will even make them come together against you on every side, and I will have you uncovered before them so that they may see your shame.";
B._Eze16_38="And you will be judged by me as women are judged who have been untrue to their husbands and have taken life; and I will let loose against you passion and bitter feeling.";
B._Eze16_39="I will give you into their hands, and your arched room will be overturned and your high places broken down; they will take your clothing off you and take away your fair jewels: and when they have done, you will be uncovered and shamed.";
B._Eze16_40="And they will get together a meeting against you, stoning you with stones and wounding you with their swords.";
B._Eze16_41="And they will have you burned with fire, sending punishments on you before the eyes of great numbers of women; and I will put an end to your loose ways, and you will no longer give payment.";
B._Eze16_42="And the heat of my wrath against you will have an end, and my bitter feeling will be turned away from you, and I will be quiet and will be angry no longer.";
B._Eze16_43="Because you have not kept in mind the days when you were young, but have been troubling me with all these things; for this reason I will make the punishment of your ways come on your head, says the Lord, because you have done this evil thing in addition to all your disgusting acts.";
B._Eze16_44="See, in every common saying about you it will be said, As the mother is, so is her daughter.";
B._Eze16_45="You are the daughter of your mother whose soul is turned in disgust from her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters who were turned in disgust from their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.";
B._Eze16_46="Your older sister is Samaria, living at your left hand, she and her daughters: and your younger sister, living at your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.";
B._Eze16_47="Still you have not gone in their ways or done the disgusting things which they have done; but, as if that was only a little thing, you have gone deeper in evil than they in all your ways.";
B._Eze16_48="By my life, says the Lord, Sodom your sister never did, she or her daughters, what you and your daughters have done.";
B._Eze16_49="Truly, this was the sin of your sister Sodom: pride, a full measure of food, and the comforts of wealth in peace, were seen in her and her daughters, and she gave no help to the poor or to those in need.";
B._Eze16_50="They were full of pride and did what was disgusting to me: and so I took them away as you have seen.";
B._Eze16_51="And Samaria has not done half your sins; but you have made the number of your disgusting acts greater than theirs, making your sisters seem more upright than you by all the disgusting things which you have done.";
B._Eze16_52="And you yourself will be put to shame, in that you have given the decision for your sisters; through your sins, which are more disgusting than theirs, they are more upright than you: truly, you will be shamed and made low, for you have made your sisters seem upright.";
B._Eze16_53="And I will let their fate be changed, the fate of Sodom and her daughters, and the fate of Samaria and her daughters, and your fate with theirs.";
B._Eze16_54="So that you will be shamed and made low because of all you have done, when I have mercy on you.";
B._Eze16_55="And your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, will go back to their first condition, and Samaria and her daughters will go back to their first condition, and you and your daughters will go back to your first condition.";
B._Eze16_56="Was not your sister Sodom an oath in your mouth in the day of your pride,";
B._Eze16_57="Before your shame was uncovered? Now you have become like her a word of shame to the daughters of Edom and all who are round about you, the daughters of the Philistines who put shame on you round about.";
B._Eze16_58="The reward of your evil designs and your disgusting ways has come on you, says the Lord.";
B._Eze16_59="For this is what the Lord has said: I will do to you as you have done, you who, putting the oath on one side, have let the agreement be broken.";
B._Eze16_60="But still I will keep in mind the agreement made with you in the days when you were young, and I will make with you an eternal agreement.";
B._Eze16_61="Then at the memory of your ways you will be overcome with shame, when I take your sisters, the older and the younger, and give them to you for daughters, but not by your agreement.";
B._Eze16_62="And I will make my agreement with you; and you will be certain that I am the Lord:";
B._Eze16_63="So that, at the memory of these things, you may be at a loss, never opening your mouth because of your shame; when you have my forgiveness for all you have done, says the Lord.";
B._Eze17_1="And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze17_2="Son of man, give out a dark saying, and make a comparison for the children of Israel,";
B._Eze17_3="And say, This is what the Lord has said: A great eagle with great wings, full of long feathers of different colours, came to Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar:";
B._Eze17_4="Biting off the highest of its young branches, he took it to the land of Canaan, and put it in a town of traders.";
B._Eze17_5="And he took some of the seed of the land, planting it in fertile earth, placing it by great waters; he put it in like a willow-tree.";
B._Eze17_6="And its growth went on and it became a vine, low and widely stretching, whose branches were turned to him and its roots were under him: so it became a vine, putting out branches and young leaves.";
B._Eze17_7="And there was another eagle with great wings and thick feathers: and now this vine, pushing out its roots to him, sent out its branches in his direction from the bed where it was planted, so that he might give it water.";
B._Eze17_8="He had it planted in a good field by great waters so that it might put out branches and have fruit and be a strong vine.";
B._Eze17_9="Say, This is what the Lord has said: Will it do well? will he not have its roots pulled up and its branches cut off, so that all its young leaves may become dry and it may be pulled up by its roots?";
B._Eze17_10="And if it is planted will it do well? will it not become quite dry at the touch of the east wind, drying up in the bed where it was planted?";
B._Eze17_11="Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze17_12="Say now to this uncontrolled people, Are these things not clear to you? Say to them, See, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and took its king and its rulers away with him to Babylon;";
B._Eze17_13="And he took one of the sons of the king and made an agreement with him; and he put him under an oath, and took away the great men of the land:";
B._Eze17_14="So that the kingdom might be made low with no power of lifting itself up, but might keep his agreement to be his servants.";
B._Eze17_15="But he went against his authority in sending representatives to Egypt to get from them horses and a great army. Will he do well? will he be safe who does such things? if the agreement is broken will he be safe?";
B._Eze17_16="By my life, says the Lord, truly in the place of the king who made him king, whose oath he put on one side and let his agreement with him be broken, even in Babylon he will come to his death.";
B._Eze17_17="And Pharaoh with his strong army and great forces will be no help to him in the war, when they put up earthworks and make strong walls for the cutting off of lives:";
B._Eze17_18="For he put his oath on one side in letting the agreement be broken; and though he had given his hand to it, he did all these things; he will not get away safe.";
B._Eze17_19="And so the Lord has said, By my life, truly, for my oath which he put on one side, and my agreement which has been broken, I will send punishment on his head.";
B._Eze17_20="My net will be stretched out over him, and he will be taken in my cords, and I will send him to Babylon, and there I will be his judge for the wrong which he has done against me.";
B._Eze17_21="All his best fighting-men will be put to the sword, and the rest will be sent away to every wind: and you will be certain that I the Lord have said it.";
B._Eze17_22="This is what the Lord has said: Further, I will take the highest top of the cedar and put it in the earth; cutting off from the highest of his young branches a soft one, I will have it planted on a high and great mountain;";
B._Eze17_23="It will be planted on the high mountain of Israel: it will put out branches and have fruit and be a fair cedar: under it all birds of every sort will make their living-place, resting in the shade of its branches.";
B._Eze17_24="And it will be clear to all the trees of the field that I the Lord have made low the high tree and made high the low tree, drying up the green tree and making the dry tree full of growth; I the Lord have said it and have done it.";
B._Eze18_1="The word of the Lord came to me again, saying,";
B._Eze18_2="Why do you make use of this saying about the land of Israel, The fathers have been tasting bitter grapes and the children's teeth are on edge?";
B._Eze18_3="By my life, says the Lord, you will no longer have this saying in Israel.";
B._Eze18_4="See, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so the soul of the son is mine: death will be the fate of the sinner's soul.";
B._Eze18_5="But if a man is upright, living rightly and doing righteousness,";
B._Eze18_6="And has not taken flesh with the blood for food, or given worship to the images of the children of Israel; if he has not had connection with his neighbour's wife, or come near to a woman at the time when she is unclean;";
B._Eze18_7="And has done no wrong to any, but has given back to the debtor what is his, and has taken no one's goods by force, and has given food to him who was in need of it, and clothing to him who was without it;";
B._Eze18_8="And has not given his money out at interest or taken great profits, and, turning his hand from evil-doing, has kept faith between man and man,";
B._Eze18_9="And has been guided by my rules and has kept my laws and done them: he is upright, life will certainly be his, says the Lord.";
B._Eze18_10="If he has a son who is a thief, a taker of life, who does any of these things,";
B._Eze18_11="Who has taken flesh with the blood as food, and has had connection with his neighbour's wife,";
B._Eze18_12="Has done wrong to the poor and to him who is in need, and taken property by force, and has not given back to one in his debt what is his, and has given worship to images and has done disgusting things,";
B._Eze18_13="And has given out his money at interest and taken great profits: he will certainly not go on living: he has done all these disgusting things: death will certainly be his fate; his blood will be on him.";
B._Eze18_14="Now if he has a son who sees all his father's sins which he has done, and in fear does not do the same:";
B._Eze18_15="Who has not taken the flesh with the blood for food, or given worship to the images of the children of Israel, and has not had connection with his neighbour's wife,";
B._Eze18_16="Or done wrong to any, or taken anything from one in his debt, or taken goods by force, but has given food to him who was in need of it, and clothing to him who was without it;";
B._Eze18_17="Who has kept his hand from evil-doing and has not taken interest or great profits, who has done my orders and been guided by my rules: he will certainly not be put to death for the evil-doing of his father; life will certainly be his.";
B._Eze18_18="As for his father, because he was cruel, took goods by force, and did what is not good among his people, truly, death will overtake him in his evil-doing.";
B._Eze18_19="But you say, Why does not the son undergo punishment for the evil-doing of the father? When the son has done what is ordered and right, and has kept my rules and done them, life will certainly be his.";
B._Eze18_20="The soul which does sin will be put to death: the son will not be made responsible for the evil-doing of the father, or the father for the evil-doing of the son; the righteousness of the upright will be on himself, and the evil-doing of the evil-doer on himself.";
B._Eze18_21="But if the evil-doer, turning away from all the sins which he has done, keeps my rules and does what is ordered and right, life will certainly be his; death will not be his fate.";
B._Eze18_22="Not one of the sins which he has done will be kept in memory against him: in the righteousness which he has done he will have life.";
B._Eze18_23="Have I any pleasure in the death of the evil-doer? says the Lord: am I not pleased if he is turned from his way so that he may have life?";
B._Eze18_24="But when the upright man, turning away from his righteousness, does evil, like all the disgusting things which the evil man does, will he have life? Not one of his upright acts will be kept in memory: in the wrong which he has done and in his sin death will overtake him.";
B._Eze18_25="But you say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Give ear, now, O children of Israel; is my way not equal? are not your ways unequal?";
B._Eze18_26="When the upright man, turning away from his righteousness, does evil, death will overtake him; in the evil which he has done death will overtake him.";
B._Eze18_27="Again, when the evil-doer, turning away from the evil he has done, does what is ordered and right, he will have life for his soul.";
B._Eze18_28="Because he had fear and was turned away from all the wrong which he had done, life will certainly be his, death will not be his fate.";
B._Eze18_29="But still the children of Israel say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O children of Israel, are my ways not equal? are not your ways unequal?";
B._Eze18_30="For this cause I will be your judge, O children of Israel, judging every man by his ways, says the Lord. Come back and be turned from all your sins; so that they may not be the cause of your falling into evil.";
B._Eze18_31="Put away all your evil-doing in which you have done sin; and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit: why are you desiring death, O children of Israel?";
B._Eze18_32="For I have no pleasure in the death of him on whom death comes, says the Lord: be turned back then, and have life.";
B._Eze19_1="Take up now a song of grief for the ruler of Israel, and say,";
B._Eze19_2="What was your mother? Like a she-lion among lions, stretched out among the young lions she gave food to her little ones.";
B._Eze19_3="And one of her little ones came to growth under her care, and became a young lion, learning to go after beasts for his food; and he took men for his meat.";
B._Eze19_4="And the nations had news of him; he was taken in the hole they had made: and, pulling him with hooks, they took him into the land of Egypt.";
B._Eze19_5="Now when she saw that her hope was made foolish and gone, she took another of her little ones and made him into a young lion.";
B._Eze19_6="And he went up and down among the lions and became a young lion, learning to go after beasts for his food; and he took men for his meat.";
B._Eze19_7="And he sent destruction on their widows and made waste their towns; and the land and everything in it became waste because of the loud sound of his voice.";
B._Eze19_8="Then the nations came against him from the kingdoms round about: their net was stretched over him and he was taken in the hole they had made.";
B._Eze19_9="They made him a prisoner with hooks, and took him to the king of Babylon; they put him in the strong place so that his voice might be sounding no longer on the mountains of Israel.";
B._Eze19_10="Your mother was in comparison like a vine, planted by the waters: she was fertile and full of branches because of the great waters.";
B._Eze19_11="And she had a strong rod for a rod of authority for the rulers, and it became tall among the clouds and it was seen lifted up among the number of its branches.";
B._Eze19_12="But she was uprooted in burning wrath, and made low on the earth; the east wind came, drying her up, and her branches were broken off; her strong rod became dry, the fire made a meal of it.";
B._Eze19_13="And now she is planted in the waste land, in a dry and unwatered country.";
B._Eze19_14="And fire has gone out from her rod, causing the destruction of her branches, so that there is no strong rod in her to be the ruler's rod of authority. This is a song of grief, and it was for a song of grief.";
B._Eze20_1="Now it came about in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, that certain of the responsible men of Israel came to get directions from the Lord and were seated before me.";
B._Eze20_2="Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Eze20_3="Son of man, say to the responsible men of Israel, This is what the Lord has said: Have you come to get directions from me? By my life, says the Lord, you will get no directions from me.";
B._Eze20_4="Will you be their judge, O son of man, will you be their judge? make clear to them the disgusting ways of their fathers,";
B._Eze20_5="And say to them, This is what the Lord has said: In the day when I took Israel for myself, when I made an oath to the seed of the family of Jacob, and I gave them knowledge of myself in the land of Egypt, saying to them with an oath, I am the Lord your God;";
B._Eze20_6="In that day I gave my oath to take them out of the land of Egypt into a land which I had been searching out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all lands:";
B._Eze20_7="And I said to them, Let every man among you put away the disgusting things to which his eyes are turned, and do not make yourselves unclean with the images of Egypt; I am the Lord your God.";
B._Eze20_8="But they would not be controlled by me, and did not give ear to me; they did not put away the disgusting things to which their eyes were turned, or give up the images of Egypt: then I said I would let loose my passion on them to give full effect to my wrath against them in the land of Egypt.";
B._Eze20_9="And I was acting for the honour of my name, so that it might not be made unclean before the eyes of the nations among whom they were, and before whose eyes I gave them knowledge of myself, by taking them out of the land of Egypt.";
B._Eze20_10="So I made them go out of the land of Egypt and took them into the waste land.";
B._Eze20_11="And I gave them my rules and made clear to them my orders, which, if a man keeps them, will be life to him.";
B._Eze20_12="And further, I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, so that it might be clear that I, who make them holy, am the Lord.";
B._Eze20_13="But the children of Israel would not be controlled by me in the waste land: they were not guided by my rules, and they were turned away from my orders, which, if a man does them, will be life to him; and they had no respect for my Sabbaths: then I said that I would let loose my passion on them in the waste land, and put an end to them.";
B._Eze20_14="And I was acting for the honour of my name, so that it might not be made unclean in the eyes of the nations, before whose eyes I had taken them out.";
B._Eze20_15="And further, I gave my oath to them in the waste land, that I would not take them into the land which I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all lands;";
B._Eze20_16="Because they were turned away from my orders, and were not guided by my rules, and had no respect for my Sabbaths: for their hearts went after their images.";
B._Eze20_17="But still my eye had pity on them and I kept them from destruction and did not put an end to them completely in the waste land.";
B._Eze20_18="And I said to their children in the waste land, Do not be guided by the rules of your fathers or keep their orders or make yourselves unclean with their images:";
B._Eze20_19="I am the Lord your God; be guided by my rules and keep my orders and do them:";
B._Eze20_20="And keep my Sabbaths holy; and they will be a sign between me and you so that it may be clear to you that I am the Lord your God.";
