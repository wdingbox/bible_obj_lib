B._Deu9_2="A people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, of whom you have knowledge and of whom it has been said, All are forced to give way before the sons of Anak.";
B._Deu9_3="Be certain then today that it is the Lord your God who goes over before you like an all-burning fire; he will send destruction on them, crushing them before you; and you will send them in flight, putting an end to them quickly, as the Lord has said.";

B._Deu9_6="Be certain then that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land as a reward for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.";
B._Deu9_7="Keep well in mind how you made the Lord your God angry in the waste land; from the day when you went out of Egypt till you came to this place, you have gone against the orders of the Lord.";
B._Deu9_8="Again in Horeb you made the Lord angry, and in his wrath he would have put an end to you.";
B._Deu9_9="When I had gone up into the mountain to be given the stones on which was recorded the agreement which the Lord made with you, I was on the mountain for forty days and forty nights without taking food or drinking water.";
B._Deu9_10="And the Lord gave me the two stones with writing on them done by the finger of God: on them were recorded all the words which the Lord said to you on the mountain out of the heart of the fire, on the day of the great meeting.";
B._Deu9_11="Then at the end of forty days and forty nights the Lord gave me those stones, the stones of the agreement.";
B._Deu9_12="And the Lord said to me, Get up now, and go down quickly from this place; for the people you have taken out of Egypt have given themselves over to evil; they have quickly been turned from the way in which I gave them orders to go; they have made themselves a metal image.";
B._Deu9_13="And then the Lord said to me, I have seen that this people is stiff-necked:";
B._Deu9_14="Let me send destruction on them till their very name is cut off; and I will make of you a nation greater and stronger than they.";
B._Deu9_15="So turning round I came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire; and the two stones of the agreement were in my hands.";
B._Deu9_16="And I saw that you had done evil against the Lord, and had made for yourselves a metal image of a young ox: you had quickly been turned from the way in which the Lord had given you orders to go.";
B._Deu9_17="And I let the stones go from my hands, and they were broken before your eyes.";
B._Deu9_18="And I went down on my face before the Lord, as at the first, for forty days and forty nights, without taking food or drinking water, because of all your sin, in doing evil in the eyes of the Lord and moving him to wrath.";
B._Deu9_19="For I was full of fear because of the wrath of the Lord which was burning against you, with your destruction in view. But again the Lord's ear was open to my prayer.";
B._Deu9_20="And the Lord, in his wrath, would have put Aaron to death: and I made prayer for Aaron at the same time.";
B._Deu9_21="And I took your sin, the image which you had made, and put it in the fire and had it hammered and crushed very small till it was only dust: and the dust I put in the stream flowing down from the mountain.";
B._Deu9_22="Again at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you made the Lord angry.";
B._Deu9_23="And when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and take the land which I have given you; you went against the orders of the Lord your God, and had no faith in him, and would not give ear to his voice.";
B._Deu9_24="From the day when I first had knowledge of you, you have gone against the word of the Lord.";
B._Deu9_25="So I went down on my face in prayer before the Lord for forty days and forty nights as I did at first; because the Lord had said that he would put an end to you.";
B._Deu9_26="And I made prayer to the Lord and said, O Lord God, do not send destruction on your people and your heritage, to whom, by your great power, you have given salvation, whom you have taken out of Egypt by the strength of your hand.";
B._Deu9_27="Keep in mind your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, not looking at the hard heart of this people, or their evil-doing and their sin:";
B._Deu9_28="Or it may be said in the land from which you have taken them, Because the Lord was not able to take them into the land which he said he would give them, and because of his hate for them, he has taken them out to put them to death in the waste land.";
B._Deu9_29="But still they are your people and your heritage, whom you took out by your great power and by your stretched-out arm.";
B._Deu10_1="At that time the Lord said to me, Make two other stones, cut like the first two, and come up to me on the mountain, and make an ark of wood.";
B._Deu10_2="And I will put on the stones the words which were on the first stones which were broken by you, and you are to put them into the ark.";
B._Deu10_3="So I made an ark of hard wood, and had two stones cut like the others, and went up the mountain with the stones in my hands.";
B._Deu10_4="And he put on the stones, as in the first writing, the ten rules which the Lord gave you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the great meeting: and the Lord gave the stones to me.";
B._Deu10_5="And turning round I came down from the mountain and put the stones in the ark which I had made; and there they are as the Lord gave me orders.";
B._Deu10_6="(And the children of Israel went on from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah: there death came to Aaron and he was put to rest in the earth; and Eleazar, his son, took his place as priest.";
B._Deu10_7="From there they went on to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of streams of water.";
B._Deu10_8="At that time the Lord had the tribe of Levi marked out to take up the ark of the Lord's agreement, to be before the Lord and to do his work and to give blessings in his name, to this day.";
B._Deu10_9="For this reason Levi has no part or heritage for himself among his brothers: the Lord is his heritage, as the Lord your God said to him.)";
B._Deu10_10="And I was in the mountain, as at the first time, for forty days and forty nights; and again the ears of the Lord were open to my prayer, and he did not send destruction on you.";
B._Deu10_11="Then the Lord said to me, Get up and go on your journey before the people, so that they may go in and take the land which I said in my oath to their fathers that I would give them.";
B._Deu10_12="And now, Israel, what would the Lord your God have you do, but to go in the fear of the Lord your God, walking in all his ways and loving him and doing his pleasure with all your heart and all your soul,";
B._Deu10_13="Doing the orders of the Lord and keeping his laws which I give you this day for your good?";
B._Deu10_14="The Lord your God is ruler of heaven, of the heaven of heavens, and of the earth with everything in it.";
B._Deu10_15="But the Lord had delight in your fathers and love for them, marking out for himself their seed after them, even you, from all peoples, as at this day.";
B._Deu10_16="Let your circumcision be of the heart, and put away your pride.";
B._Deu10_17="For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, strong in power and greatly to be feared, who has no respect for any man's position and takes no rewards:";
B._Deu10_18="Judging uprightly in the cause of the widow and of the child who has no father, and giving food and clothing in his mercy to the man from a strange country.";
B._Deu10_19="So be kind to the man from a strange country who is living among you, for you yourselves were living in a strange country in the land of Egypt.";
B._Deu10_20="Let the fear of the Lord your God be before you, give him worship and be true to him at all times, taking your oaths in his name.";

B._Deu10_22="Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now the Lord your God has made you like the stars of heaven in number.";
B._Deu11_1="So have love for the Lord your God, and give him worship, and keep his laws and his decisions and his orders at all times.";
B._Deu11_2="And be certain in your minds this day; for these words are not said to your children, who have had no experience of the training of the Lord your God, and who have not seen his great power or his strong hand and his stretched-out arm,";
B._Deu11_3="Or his signs and wonders which he did in Egypt, to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and all his land;";
B._Deu11_4="And what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and their war-carriages; how he made the waters of the Red Sea come up over them when they went after you, and how the Lord put an end to them even to this day;";
B._Deu11_5="And what he did for you in the waste land, till you came to this place;";
B._Deu11_6="And what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; when they went down into the open mouth of the earth, with their families and their tents and every living thing which was theirs, before the eyes of all Israel:";
B._Deu11_7="But your eyes have seen all the great works of the Lord which he has done.";
B._Deu11_8="So keep all the orders which I give you today, so that you may be strong, and go in and take the land which is to be your heritage;";
B._Deu11_9="And that your days may be long in the land which the Lord gave by an oath to your fathers and to their seed after them, a land flowing with milk and honey.";
B._Deu11_10="For the land where you are going is not like the land of Egypt from which you have come, where you put in your seeds, watering them with your foot, like a planted garden:";
B._Deu11_11="But the land where you are going is a land of hills and valleys, drinking in the rain of heaven:";
B._Deu11_12="A land cared for by the Lord your God: the eyes of the Lord your God are on it at all times from one end of the year to the other.";
B._Deu11_13="And it will be that if you truly give ear to the orders which I put before you this day, loving the Lord your God and worshipping him with all your heart and all your soul,";
B._Deu11_14="Then I will send rain on your land at the right time, the early rains and the late rains, so that you may get in your grain and your wine and your oil.";
