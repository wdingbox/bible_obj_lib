B._Deu1_26="But going against the order of the Lord your God, you would not go up:";
B._Deu1_27="And you made an angry outcry in your tents, and said, In his hate for us the Lord has taken us out of the land of Egypt, to give us up into the hands of the Amorites for our destruction.";
B._Deu1_28="Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our hearts feeble with fear by saying, The people are greater and taller than we are, and the towns are great and walled up to heaven; and more than this, we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.";
B._Deu1_29="Then I said to you, Have no fear of them.";
B._Deu1_30="The Lord your God who goes before you will be fighting for you, and will do such wonders as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;";
B._Deu1_31="And in the waste land, where you have seen how the Lord was supporting you, as a man does his son, in all your journeying till you came to this place.";
B._Deu1_32="But for all this, you had no faith in the Lord your God,";
B._Deu1_33="Who goes before you on your way, looking for a place where you may put up your tents, in fire by night, lighting up the way you are to go, and in a cloud by day.";
B._Deu1_34="And the Lord, hearing your words, was angry, and said with an oath,";
B._Deu1_35="Truly, not one of this evil generation will see that good land which I said I would give to your fathers,";
B._Deu1_36="But only Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, he will see it; and to him and to his children I will give the land over which his feet have gone, because he has been true to the Lord with all his heart.";
B._Deu1_37="And, in addition, the Lord was angry with me because of you, saying, You yourself will not go into it:";
B._Deu1_38="Joshua, the son of Nun, your servant, he will go into the land: say to him that he is to be strong, for he will be Israel's guide into their heritage.";
B._Deu1_39="And your little ones, who, you said, would come into strange hands, your children, who now have no knowledge of good or evil, they will go into that land, and to them I will give it and it will be theirs.";
B._Deu1_40="But as for you, go back, journeying into the waste land by the way of the Red Sea.";
B._Deu1_41="Then you said to me, We have done evil against the Lord, we will go up to the attack, as the Lord our God has given us orders. And arming yourselves every one, you made ready to go up without care into the hill-country.";
B._Deu1_42="And the Lord said to me, Say to them, Do not go up to the attack; for I am not among you, and you will be overcome by those who are against you.";
B._Deu1_43="This I said to you, but you gave no attention and went against the orders of the Lord, and in your pride went up into the hill-country.";
B._Deu1_44="And the Amorites who were in the hill-country came out against you and put you to flight, rushing after you like bees, and overcame you in Seir, driving you even as far as Hormah.";
B._Deu1_45="And you came back, weeping before the Lord; but the Lord gave no attention to your cries and did not give ear to you.";
B._Deu1_46="So you were kept waiting in Kadesh for a long time.";
B._Deu2_1="Then we went back, journeying into the waste land by the way to the Red Sea, as the Lord had said to me: and we were a long time going round Mount Seir.";
B._Deu2_2="And the Lord said to me,";
B._Deu2_3="You have been journeying round this mountain long enough: now go to the north;";
B._Deu2_4="And give the people orders, saying, You are about to go through the land of your brothers, the children of Esau, who are living in Seir; and they will have fear of you; so take care what you do:";
B._Deu2_5="Make no attack on them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even space enough for a man's foot: because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for his heritage.";
B._Deu2_6="You may get food for your needs from them for a price, and water for drinking.";
B._Deu2_7="For the blessing of the Lord your God has been on you in all the work of your hands: he has knowledge of your wanderings through this great waste: these forty years the Lord your God has been with you, and you have been short of nothing.";
B._Deu2_8="So we went on past our brothers, the children of Esau, living in Seir, by the road through the Arabah, from Elath and Ezion-geber. And turning, we went by the road through the waste land of Moab.";
B._Deu2_9="And the Lord said to me, Make no attack on Moab and do not go to war with them, for I will not give you any of his land: because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for their heritage.";
B._Deu2_10="(In the past the Emim were living there; a great people, equal in numbers to the Anakim and as tall;";
B._Deu2_11="They are numbered among the Rephaim, like the Anakim; but are named Emim by the Moabites.";
B._Deu2_12="And the Horites in earlier times were living in Seir, but the children of Esau took their place; they sent destruction on them and took their land for themselves, as Israel did to the land of his heritage which the Lord gave them.)";
B._Deu2_13="Get up now, and go over the stream Zered. So we went over the stream Zered.";
B._Deu2_14="Thirty-eight years had gone by from the time when we came away from Kadesh-barnea till we went over the stream Zered; by that time all the generation of the men of war among us were dead, as the Lord had said.";
B._Deu2_15="For the hand of the Lord was against them, working their destruction, till all were dead.";
B._Deu2_16="So when death had overtaken all the men of war among the people,";
B._Deu2_17="The word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Deu2_18="You are about to go by Ar, the limit of the country of Moab;";
B._Deu2_19="And when you come near the land of the children of Ammon, give them no cause of trouble and do not make war on them, for I will not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon for your heritage: because I have given it to the children of Lot.";
B._Deu2_20="(That land is said to have been a land of the Rephaim, for Rephaim had been living there in earlier times, but they were named Zamzummim by the Ammonites;";
B._Deu2_21="They were a great people, tall as the Anakim, and equal to them in number; but the Lord sent destruction on them and the children of Ammon took their place, living in their land;";
B._Deu2_22="As he did for the children of Esau living in Seir, when he sent destruction on the Horites before them, and they took their land where they are living to this day:";
B._Deu2_23="And the Avvim, living in the small towns as far as Gaza, came to destruction by the hands of the Caphtorim who came out from Caphtor and took their land.)";
B._Deu2_24="Get up now, and go on your journey, crossing over the valley of the Arnon: see, I have given into your hands Sihon, the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and all his land: go forward to make it yours, and make war on him,";
B._Deu2_25="From now on I will put the fear of you in all peoples under heaven, who, hearing of you, will be shaking with fear and grief of heart because of you.";
B._Deu2_26="Then from the waste land of Kedemoth I sent representatives to Sihon, king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,";
B._Deu2_27="Let me go through your land: I will keep to the highway, not turning to the right or to the left;";
B._Deu2_28="Let me have food, at a price, for my needs, and water for drinking: only let me go through on foot;";
B._Deu2_29="As the children of Esau did for me in Seir and the Moabites in Ar; till I have gone over Jordan into the land which the Lord our God is giving us.";
B._Deu2_30="But Sihon, king of Heshbon, would not let us go through; for the Lord your God made his spirit hard and his heart strong, so that he might give him up into your hands as at this day.";
B._Deu2_31="And the Lord said to me, See, from now on I have given Sihon and his land into your hands: go forward now to take his land and make it yours.";
B._Deu2_32="Then Sihon came out against us with all his people, to make an attack on us at Jahaz.";
B._Deu2_33="And the Lord our God gave him into our hands; and we overcame him and his sons and all his people.";
B._Deu2_34="At that time we took all his towns, and gave them over to complete destruction, together with men, women, and children; we had no mercy on any:";
B._Deu2_35="Only the cattle we took for ourselves, with the goods from the towns we had taken.";
B._Deu2_36="From Aroer on the edge of the valley of the Arnon and from the town in the valley as far as Gilead, no town was strong enough to keep us out; the Lord our God gave them all into our hands:";
B._Deu2_37="But you did not go near the land of the children of Ammon, that is, all the side of the river Jabbok or the towns of the hill-country, wherever the Lord our God had said we were not to go.";
B._Deu3_1="Then turning we took the road to Bashan: and Og, king of Bashan, came out against us with all his people, and made an attack on us at Edrei.";
B._Deu3_2="And the Lord said to me, Have no fear of him: for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hands; do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who was ruling in Heshbon.";
B._Deu3_3="So the Lord our God gave up Og, king of Bashan, and all his people into our hands; and we overcame him so completely that all his people came to their end in the fight.";
B._Deu3_4="At that time we took all his towns; there was not one town of the sixty towns, all the country of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which we did not take.";
B._Deu3_5="All these towns had high walls round them with doors and locks; and in addition we took a great number of unwalled towns.";
B._Deu3_6="And we put them to the curse, every town together with men, women, and children.";
B._Deu3_7="But we took for ourselves all the cattle and the stored wealth of the towns.";
B._Deu3_8="At that time we took their land from the two kings of the Amorites on the far side of Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon;";
B._Deu3_9="(By the Sidonians, Hermon is named Sirion, and by the Amorites Shenir;)";
B._Deu3_10="All the towns of the table-land and all Gilead and Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, towns of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.";
B._Deu3_11="(For Og, king of Bashan, was the last of all the Rephaim; his bed was made of iron; is it not in Rabbah, in the land of the children of Ammon? It was nine cubits long and four cubits wide, measured by the common cubit.)";
B._Deu3_12="And this land which we took at that time, from Aroer by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead with its towns, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites.";
B._Deu3_13="The rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, all the land of Argob, together with Bashan, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (This land is named the land of the Rephaim.";
B._Deu3_14="Jair, the son of Manasseh, took all the land of Argob, as far as the country of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, naming it, Bashan, Havvoth-Jair after himself, as it is to this day.)";
B._Deu3_15="And Gilead I gave to Machir.";
B._Deu3_16="And the land from Gilead to the valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a limit, as far as the river Jabbok which is the limit of the country of the children of Ammon, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites;";
B._Deu3_17="As well as the Arabah, with the river Jordan as their limit, from Chinnereth to the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah to the east.";
B._Deu3_18="At that time I gave you orders, saying, The Lord has given you this land for your heritage: all the men of war are to go over armed before your brothers the children of Israel.";
B._Deu3_19="But your wives and your little ones and your cattle (for it is clear that you have much cattle) may go on living in the towns I have given you;";
B._Deu3_20="Till the Lord has given rest to your brothers as to you, and till they have taken for themselves the land which the Lord your God is giving them on the other side of Jordan: then you may go back, every man of you, to the heritage which I have given you.";
B._Deu3_21="And I gave orders to Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen what the Lord your God has done to these two kings: so will the Lord do to all the kingdoms into which you come.";
B._Deu3_22="Have no fear of them, for the Lord your God will be fighting for you.";
B._Deu3_23="And at that time I made request to the Lord, saying,";
B._Deu3_24="O Lord God, you have now for the first time let your servant see your great power and the strength of your hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth able to do such great works and such acts of power?";
B._Deu3_25="Let me go over, O Lord, and see the good land on the other side of Jordan, and that fair mountain country, even Lebanon.";
B._Deu3_26="But the Lord was angry with me because of you and would not give ear to my prayer; and the Lord said to me, Let it be enough, say no more about this thing.";
B._Deu3_27="Go up to the top of Pisgah, and turning your eyes to the west and the north, to the south and the east, see the land with your eyes: for you are not to go over Jordan.";
B._Deu3_28="But give my orders to Joshua, comforting him and making him strong; for he is to go over Jordan at the head of this people, and he will give them this land which you will see for their heritage.";
B._Deu3_29="So we were waiting in the valley facing Beth-peor.";
B._Deu4_1="And now give ear, O Israel, to the laws and the decisions which I am teaching you, and do them; so that life may be yours, and you may go in and take for yourselves the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, is giving you.";
B._Deu4_2="Make no addition to the orders which I give you, and take nothing from them, but keep the orders of the Lord your God which I give you.";
B._Deu4_3="Your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baal-peor: for destruction came from the Lord on all those among you who went after Baal-peor.";
B._Deu4_4="But you who kept faith with the Lord are living, every one of you, today.";
B._Deu4_5="I have been teaching you laws and decisions, as I was ordered to do by the Lord my God, so that you might keep them in the land to which you are going to take it for your heritage.";
B._Deu4_6="So keep these laws and do them; for so will your wisdom and good sense be clear in the eyes of the peoples, who hearing all these laws will say, Truly, this great nation is a wise and far-seeing people.";
B._Deu4_7="For what great nation has a god so near to them as the Lord our God is, whenever we are turned to him in prayer?";
B._Deu4_8="And what great nation has laws and decisions so right as all this law which I put before you today?";
B._Deu4_9="Only take care, and keep watch on your soul, for fear that the things which your eyes have seen go from your memory and from your heart all the days of your life; but let the knowledge of them be given to your children and to your children's children;";
B._Deu4_10="That day when you were waiting before the Lord your God in Horeb, and the Lord said to me, Make all the people come together, so that hearing my words they may go in fear of me all the days of their life on earth and give this teaching to their children.";
B._Deu4_11="And you came near, waiting at the foot of the mountain; and flames of fire went up from the mountain to the heart of heaven, with dark clouds, and all was black as night.";
B._Deu4_12="And the voice of the Lord came to you out of the fire: the sound of his words came to your ears but you saw no form; there was nothing but a voice.";
B._Deu4_13="And he gave you his agreement with you, the ten rules which you were to keep, which he put in writing on the two stones of the law.";
B._Deu4_14="And the Lord gave me orders at that time to make clear to you these laws and decisions, so that you might do them in the land to which you are going, and which is to be your heritage.";
B._Deu4_15="So keep watch on yourselves with care; for you saw no form of any sort on the day when the voice of the Lord came to you in Horeb out of the heart of the fire:";
B._Deu4_16="So that you may not be turned to evil ways and make for yourselves an image in the form of any living thing, male or female,";
B._Deu4_17="Or any beast of the earth, or winged bird of the air,";
B._Deu4_18="Or of anything which goes flat on the earth, or any fish in the water under the earth.";
B._Deu4_19="And when your eyes are lifted up to heaven, and you see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the army of heaven, do not let yourselves be moved to give them worship, or become the servants of what the Lord has given equally to all peoples under heaven.";
B._Deu4_20="But the Lord has taken you out of the flaming fire, out of Egypt, to be to him the people of his heritage, as you are today.";
B._Deu4_21="And the Lord was angry with me because of you, and made an oath that I was not to go over Jordan into the good land which the Lord is giving you for your heritage:";
B._Deu4_22="But death is to come to me in this land, I may not go over Jordan: but you will go over and take that good land for your heritage.";
B._Deu4_23="Take care that you do not let the agreement of the Lord your God, which he has made with you, go out of your mind, or make for yourselves images of any sort, against the orders which the Lord your God has given you.";
B._Deu4_24="For the Lord your God is an all-burning fire, and he will not let the honour which is his be given to any other.";
B._Deu4_25="If, when you have had children and children's children, and have been living a long time in the land, you are turned to evil ways, and make an image of any sort, and do evil in the eyes of the Lord your God, moving him to wrath:";
B._Deu4_26="May heaven and earth be my witnesses against you today, that destruction will quickly overtake you, cutting you off from that land which you are going over Jordan to take; your days will not be long in that land, but you will come to a complete end.";
B._Deu4_27="And the Lord will send you wandering among the peoples; only a small band of you will be kept from death among the nations where the Lord will send you.";
B._Deu4_28="There you will be the servants of gods, made by men's hands, of wood and stone, having no power of seeing or hearing or taking food or smelling.";
B._Deu4_29="But if in those lands you are turned again to the Lord your God, searching for him with all your heart and soul, he will not keep himself from you.";
B._Deu4_30="When you are in trouble and all these things have come on you, if, in the future, you are turned again to the Lord your God, and give ear to his voice:";
B._Deu4_31="Because the Lord your God is a God of mercy, he will not take away his help from you or let destruction overtake you, or be false to the agreement which he made by an oath with your fathers.";
B._Deu4_32="Give thought now to the days which are past, before your time, from the day when God first gave life to man on the earth, and searching from one end of heaven to the other, see if such a great thing as this has ever been, or if anything like it has been talked of in story.";
B._Deu4_33="Has any people ever gone on living after hearing the voice of God out of the heart of the fire as you did?";
B._Deu4_34="Has God ever before taken a nation for himself from out of another nation, by punishments and signs and wonders, by war and by a strong hand and a stretched-out arm and great acts of wonder and fear, as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes?";
B._Deu4_35="All this he let you see, so that you might be certain that the Lord is God and there is no other.";
B._Deu4_36="Out of heaven itself his voice came to you, teaching you; and on earth he let you see his great fire; and his words came to your ears out of the heart of the fire.";
B._Deu4_37="And because of his love for your fathers, he took their seed and made it his, and he himself, present among you, took you out of Egypt by his great power;";
B._Deu4_38="Driving out before you nations greater and stronger than you, to take you into their land and give it to you for your heritage, as at this day.";
B._Deu4_39="So today be certain, and keep the knowledge deep in your hearts, that the Lord is God, in heaven on high and here on earth; there is no other God.";
B._Deu4_40="Then keep his laws and his orders which I give you today, so that it may be well for you and for your children after you, and that your lives may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you for ever.";
B._Deu4_41="Then Moses had three towns marked out on the far side of Jordan looking to the east;";
