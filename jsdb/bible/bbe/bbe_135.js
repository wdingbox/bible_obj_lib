B._Amo8_9="And it will come about in that day, says the Lord God, that I will make the sun go down in the middle of the day, and I will make the earth dark in daylight:";
B._Amo8_10="Your feasts will be turned into sorrow and all your melody into songs of grief; everyone will be clothed with haircloth, and the hair of every head will be cut; I will make the weeping like that for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.";
B._Amo8_11="See, the days are coming, says the Lord God, when I will send times of great need on the land, not need of food or desire for water, but for hearing the words of the Lord.";
B._Amo8_12="And they will go wandering from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, running here and there in search of the word of the Lord, and they will not get it.";
B._Amo8_13="In that day the fair virgins and the young men will be feeble from need of water.";
B._Amo8_14="Those who make their oaths by the sin of Samaria and say, By the life of your God, O Dan; and, By the living way of Beer-sheba; even they will go down, never again to be lifted up.";
B._Amo9_1="I saw the Lord stationed by the side of the altar, giving blows to the tops of the pillars so that the doorsteps were shaking: and he said, I will let all of them be broken with earth-shocks; I will put the last of them to the sword: if any one of them goes in flight he will not get away, not one of them will be safe.";
B._Amo9_2="Even if they go deep into the underworld, my hand will take them up from there; if they go up to heaven, I will get them down:";
B._Amo9_3="Though they take cover on the top of Carmel, I will go in search of them and get them out; though they keep themselves from my eyes in the bed of the sea, I will give orders to the great snake there and he will give them a bite:";
B._Amo9_4="And though they are taken away as prisoners by their attackers, even there will I give orders to the sword to put them to death: my eyes will be fixed on them for evil and not for good.";
B._Amo9_5="For the Lord, the God of armies, is he at whose touch the land is turned to water, and everyone in it will be given up to sorrow; all of it will be overflowing like the River, and will go down again like the River of Egypt;";
B._Amo9_6="It is he who makes his rooms in the heaven, basing his arch on the earth; whose voice goes out to the waters of the sea, and sends them flowing over the face of the earth; the Lord is his name.";
B._Amo9_7="Are you not as the children of the Ethiopians to me, O children of Israel? says the Lord. Have I not taken Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Aramaeans from Kir?";
B._Amo9_8="See, the eyes of the Lord are on the evil kingdom, and I will put an end to it in all the earth; but I will not send complete destruction on Jacob, says the Lord.";
B._Amo9_9="For see, I will give orders, and I will have Israel moved about among all the nations, as grain is moved about by the shaking of the tray, but not the smallest seed will be dropped on the earth.";
B._Amo9_10="All those sinners among my people will be put to the sword who say, Evil will not overtake us or come face to face with us.";
B._Amo9_11="In that day I will put up the tent of David which has come down, and make good its broken places; and I will put up again his damaged walls, building it up as in the past;";
B._Amo9_12="So that the rest of Edom may be their heritage, and all the nations who have been named by my name, says the Lord, who is doing this.";
B._Amo9_13="See, the days will come, says the Lord, when the ploughman will overtake him who is cutting the grain, and the crusher of the grapes him who is planting seed; and sweet wine will be dropping from the mountains, and the hills will be turned into streams of wine.";
B._Amo9_14="And I will let the fate of my people Israel be changed, and they will be building up again the waste towns and living in them; they will again be planting vine-gardens and taking the wine for their drink; and they will make gardens and get the fruit of them.";
B._Amo9_15="And I will have them planted in their land, and never again will they be uprooted from their land which I have given them, says the Lord your God.";
B._Oba1_1="The vision of Obadiah. This is what the Lord has said about Edom: We have had word from the Lord, and a representative has been sent among the nations, saying, Up! and let us make war against her.";
B._Oba1_2="See, I have made you small among the nations: you are much looked down on.";
B._Oba1_3="You have been tricked by the pride of your heart, O you whose living-place is in the cracks of the rock, whose house is high up; who has said in his heart, Who will make me come down to earth?";
B._Oba1_4="Though you go up on high like an eagle, though your house is placed among the stars, I will make you come down from there, says the Lord.";
B._Oba1_5="If thieves came, attacking you by night, (how are you cut off!) would they not go on taking till they had enough? if men came cutting your grapes would they take them all?";
B._Oba1_6="How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his secret stores looked for!";
B._Oba1_7="All the men who were united with you have been false to you, driving you out to the edge of the land: the men who were at peace with you have overcome you; they have taken their heritage in your place.";
B._Oba1_8="Will I not, in that day, says the Lord, take away the wise men out of Edom, and wisdom out of the mountain of Esau?";
B._Oba1_9="And your men of war, O Teman, will be overcome with fear, so that every one of them may be cut off from the mountain of Esau.";
B._Oba1_10="Because you were the cause of violent death and because of your cruel behaviour to your brother Jacob, you will be covered with shame and will be cut off for ever.";
B._Oba1_11="Because you were there watching when men from other lands took away his goods, and strange men came into his doors, and put the fate of Jerusalem to the decision of chance; you were like one of them.";
B._Oba1_12="Do not see with pleasure your brother's evil day, the day of his fate, and do not be glad over the children of Judah on the day of their destruction, or make wide your mouth on the day of trouble.";
B._Oba1_13="Do not go into the doors of my people on the day of their downfall; do not be looking on their trouble with pleasure on the day of their downfall, or put your hands on their goods on the day of their downfall.";
B._Oba1_14="And do not take your place at the cross-roads, cutting off those of his people who get away; and do not give up to their haters those who are still there in the day of trouble.";
B._Oba1_15="For the day of the Lord is coming quickly on all nations: as you have done it will be done to you; the reward of your acts will come on your head.";
B._Oba1_16="For as you have been drinking on my holy mountain, so will all the nations go on drinking without end; they will go on drinking and the wine will go down their throats, and they will be as if they had never been.";
B._Oba1_17="But in Mount Zion some will be kept safe, and it will be holy; and the children of Jacob will take their heritage.";
B._Oba1_18="And the children of Jacob will be a fire and those of Joseph a flame, and the children of Esau dry stems of grass, burned up by them till all is gone: and there will be no people living in Esau; for the Lord has said it.";
B._Oba1_19="And they will take the South, and the lowland, and the country of Ephraim, and Gilead, as their heritage.";
B._Oba1_20="And those of the children of Israel who were the first to be taken away as prisoners, will have their heritage among the Canaanites as far as Zarephath; and those who were taken away from Jerusalem, who are in Sepharad, will have the towns of the South.";
B._Oba1_21="And those who have been kept safe will come up from Mount Zion to be judges of the mountain of Esau; and the kingdom will be the Lord's.";
B._Jon1_1="And the word of the Lord came to Jonah, the son of Amittai, saying,";
B._Jon1_2="Up! go to Nineveh, that great town, and let your voice come to it; for their evil-doing has come up before me.";
B._Jon1_3="And Jonah got up to go in flight to Tarshish, away from the Lord; and he went down to Joppa, and saw there a ship going to Tarshish: so he gave them the price of the journey and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish, away from the Lord.";
B._Jon1_4="And the Lord sent out a great wind on to the sea and there was a violent storm in the sea, so that the ship seemed in danger of being broken.";
B._Jon1_5="Then the sailors were full of fear, every man crying to his god; and the goods in the ship were dropped out into the sea to make the weight less. But Jonah had gone down into the inmost part of the ship where he was stretched out in a deep sleep.";
B._Jon1_6="And the ship's captain came to him and said to him, What are you doing sleeping? Up! say a prayer to your God, if by chance God will give a thought to us, so that we may not come to destruction.";
B._Jon1_7="And they said to one another, Come, let us put this to the decision of chance and see on whose account this evil has come on us. So they did so, and Jonah was seen to be the man.";
B._Jon1_8="Then they said to him, Now make clear to us what is your work, and where you come from? what is your country, and who are your people?";
B._Jon1_9="And he said to them, I am a Hebrew, a worshipper of the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.";
B._Jon1_10="And the men were in great fear, and they said to him, What is this you have done? For the men had knowledge of his flight from the Lord because he had not kept it from them.";
B._Jon1_11="And they said to him, What are we to do to you so that the sea may become calm for us? For the sea was getting rougher and rougher.";
B._Jon1_12="And he said to them, Take me up and put me into the sea, and the sea will become calm for you: for I am certain that because of me this great storm has come on you.";
B._Jon1_13="And the men were working hard to get back to the land, but they were not able to do so: for the sea got rougher and rougher against them.";
B._Jon1_14="So, crying to the Lord, they said, Give ear to our prayer, O Lord, give ear, and do not let destruction overtake us because of this man's life; do not put on us the sin of taking life without cause: for you, O Lord, have done what seemed good to you.";
B._Jon1_15="So they took Jonah up and put him into the sea: and the sea was no longer angry.";
B._Jon1_16="Then great was the men's fear of the Lord; and they made an offering to the Lord and took oaths to him.";
B._Jon1_17="And the Lord made ready a great fish to take Jonah into its mouth; and Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights.";
B._Jon2_1="Then Jonah made prayer to the Lord his God from the inside of the fish, and said,";
B._Jon2_2="In my trouble I was crying to the Lord, and he gave me an answer; out of the deepest underworld I sent up a cry, and you gave ear to my voice.";
B._Jon2_3="For you have put me down into the deep, into the heart of the sea; and the river was round about me; all your waves and your rolling waters went over me.";
B._Jon2_4="And I said, I have been sent away from before your eyes; how may I ever again see your holy Temple?";
B._Jon2_5="The waters were circling round me, even to the neck; the deep was about me; the sea-grass was twisted round my head.";
B._Jon2_6="I went down to the bases of the mountains; as for the earth, her walls were about me for ever: but you have taken up my life from the underworld, O Lord my God.";
B._Jon2_7="When my soul in me was overcome, I kept the memory of the Lord: and my prayer came in to you, into your holy Temple.";
B._Jon2_8="The worshippers of false gods have given up their only hope.";
B._Jon2_9="But I will make an offering to you with the voice of praise; I will give effect to my oaths. Salvation is the Lord's.";
B._Jon2_10="And at the Lord's order, the fish sent Jonah out of its mouth on to the dry land.";
B._Jon3_1="And the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time, saying,";
B._Jon3_2="Up! go to Nineveh, that great town, and give it the word which I have given you.";
B._Jon3_3="So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh as the Lord had said. Now Nineveh was a very great town, three days' journey from end to end.";
B._Jon3_4="And Jonah first of all went a day's journey into the town, and crying out said, In forty days destruction will overtake Nineveh.";
B._Jon3_5="And the people of Nineveh had belief in God; and a time was fixed for going without food, and they put on haircloth, from the greatest to the least.";
B._Jon3_6="And the word came to the king of Nineveh, and he got up from his seat of authority, and took off his robe, and covering himself with haircloth, took his seat in the dust.";
B._Jon3_7="And he had it given out in Nineveh, By the order of the king and his great men, no man or beast, herd or flock, is to have a taste of anything; let them have no food or water:";
B._Jon3_8="And let man and beast be covered with haircloth, and let them make strong prayers to God: and let everyone be turned from his evil way and the violent acts of their hands.";
B._Jon3_9="Who may say that God will not be turned, changing his purpose and turning away from his burning wrath, so that destruction may not overtake us?";
B._Jon3_10="And God saw what they did, how they were turned from their evil way; and God's purpose was changed as to the evil which he said he would do to them, and he did it not.";
B._Jon4_1="But this seemed very wrong to Jonah, and he was angry.";
B._Jon4_2="And he made prayer to the Lord and said, O Lord, is this not what I said when I was still in my country? This is why I took care to go in flight to Tarshish: for I was certain that you were a loving God, full of pity, slow to be angry and great in mercy, and ready to be turned from your purpose of evil.";
B._Jon4_3="So now, O Lord, give ear to my prayer and take my life from me; for death is better for me than life.";
B._Jon4_4="And the Lord said, Have you any right to be angry?";
B._Jon4_5="Then Jonah went out of the town, and took his seat on the east side of the town and made himself a roof of branches and took his seat under its shade till he saw what would become of the town.";
B._Jon4_6="And the Lord God made a vine come up over Jonah to give him shade over his head. And Jonah was very glad because of the vine.";
B._Jon4_7="But early on the morning after, God made ready a worm for the destruction of the vine, and it became dry and dead.";
B._Jon4_8="Then when the sun came up, God sent a burning east wind: and so great was the heat of the sun on his head that Jonah was overcome, and, requesting death for himself, said, Death is better for me than life.";
B._Jon4_9="And the Lord said to Jonah, Have you any right to be angry about the vine? And he said, I have a right to be truly angry.";
B._Jon4_10="And the Lord said, You had pity on the vine, for which you did no work and for the growth of which you were not responsible; which came up in a night and came to an end in a night;";
B._Jon4_11="And am I not to have mercy on Nineveh, that great town, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons without the power of judging between right and left, as well as much cattle?";
B._Mic1_1="The word of the Lord which came to Micah the Morashtite, in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah: his vision about Samaria and Jerusalem.";
B._Mic1_2="Give ear, you peoples, all of you; give attention, O earth and everything in it: let the Lord God be witness against you, the Lord from his holy Temple.";
B._Mic1_3="For see, the Lord is coming out from his place, and will come down, stepping on the high places of the earth.";
B._Mic1_4="And the mountains will be turned to water under him, and the deep valleys will be broken open, like wax before the fire, like waters flowing down a slope.";
B._Mic1_5="All this is because of the wrongdoing of Jacob and the sins of the children of Israel. What is the wrongdoing of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?";
B._Mic1_6="So I will make Samaria into a field and the plantings of a vine-garden: I will send its stones falling down into the valley, uncovering its bases.";
B._Mic1_7="And all her pictured images will be hammered into bits, and all the payments for her loose ways will be burned with fire, and all the images of her gods I will make waste: for with the price of a loose woman she got them together, and as the price of a loose woman will they be given back.";
B._Mic1_8="For this I will be full of sorrow and give cries of grief; I will go uncovered and unclothed: I will give cries of grief like the jackals and will be in sorrow like the ostriches.";
B._Mic1_9="For her wounds may not be made well: for it has come even to Judah, stretching up to the doorway of my people, even to Jerusalem.";
B._Mic1_10="Give no word of it in Gath, let there be no weeping at all: at Beth-le-aphrah be rolling in the dust.";
B._Mic1_11="Be uncovered and go away, you who are living in Shaphir: the one living in Zaanan has not come out of her town; Beth-ezel is taken away from its base, even from its resting-place.";
B._Mic1_12="For the one living in Maroth is waiting for good: for evil has come down from the Lord to the doorways of Jerusalem.";
B._Mic1_13="Let the war-carriage be yoked to the quick-running horse, you who are living in Lachish: she was the first cause of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the wrongdoings of Israel were seen in you.";
B._Mic1_14="For this cause give a parting offering to Moresheth-gath: the daughter of Achzib will be a deceit to the king of Israel.";
B._Mic1_15="Even now will the taker of your heritage come to you, you who are living in Mareshah: the glory of Israel will come to destruction for ever.";
B._Mic1_16="Let your head be uncovered and your hair cut off in sorrow for the children of your delight: let the hair be pulled from your head like an eagle's; for they have been taken away from you as prisoners.";
B._Mic2_1="A curse on the designers of evil, working on their beds! in the morning light they do it, because it is in their power.";
B._Mic2_2="They have a desire for fields and take them by force; and for houses and take them away: they are cruel to a man and his family, even to a man and his heritage.";
B._Mic2_3="For this cause the Lord has said, See, against this family I am purposing an evil from which you will not be able to take your necks away, and you will be weighted down by it; for it is an evil time.";
B._Mic2_4="In that day this saying will be said about you, and this song of grief will be made: The heritage of my people is measured out, and there is no one to give it back; those who have made us prisoners have taken our fields from us, and complete destruction has come to us.";
B._Mic2_5="For this cause you will have no one to make the decision by the measuring line in the meeting of the Lord.";
B._Mic2_6="Let not words like these be dropped, they say: Shame and the curse will not come to the family of Jacob!";
B._Mic2_7="Is the Lord quickly made angry? are these his doings? do not his words do good to his people Israel?";
B._Mic2_8="As for you, you have become haters of those who were at peace with you: you take the clothing of those who go by without fear, and make them prisoners of war.";
B._Mic2_9="The women of my people you have been driving away from their dearly loved children; from their young ones you are taking my glory for ever.";
B._Mic2_10="Up! and go; for this is not your rest: because it has been made unclean, the destruction ordered will come on you.";
B._Mic2_11="If a man came with a false spirit of deceit, saying, I will be a prophet to you of wine and strong drink: he would be the sort of prophet for this people.";
B._Mic2_12="I will certainly make all of you, O Jacob, come together; I will get together the rest of Israel; I will put them together like the sheep in their circle: like a flock in their green field; they will be full of the noise of men.";
B._Mic2_13="The opener of the way will go up before them: forcing their way out they will go on to the doorway and out through it: their king will go on before them, and the Lord at their head.";
B._Mic3_1="And I said, Give ear, now, you heads of Jacob and rulers of the people of Israel: is it not for you to have knowledge of what is right?";
B._Mic3_2="You who are haters of good and lovers of evil, pulling off their skin from them and their flesh from their bones;";
B._Mic3_3="Like meat they take the flesh of my people for their food, skinning them and crushing their bones, yes, cutting them up as if for the pot, like flesh inside the cooking-pot.";
B._Mic3_4="Then they will be crying to the Lord for help, but he will not give them an answer: yes, he will keep his face veiled from them at that time, because their acts have been evil.";
B._Mic3_5="This is what the Lord has said about the prophets by whom my people have been turned from the right way; who, biting with their teeth, say, Peace; and if anyone puts nothing in their mouths they make ready for war against him.";
B._Mic3_6="For this cause it will be night for you, without a vision; and it will be dark for you, without knowledge of the future; the sun will go down over the prophets, and the day will be black over them.";
B._Mic3_7="And the seers will be shamed, and the readers of the future will be at a loss, all of them covering their lips; for there is no answer from God.";
B._Mic3_8="But I truly am full of the spirit of the Lord, with power of judging and with strength to make clear to Jacob his wrongdoing and to Israel his sin.";
B._Mic3_9="Then give ear to this, you heads of the children of Jacob, you rulers of the children of Israel, hating what is right, twisting what is straight.";
B._Mic3_10="They are building up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with evil-doing.";
B._Mic3_11="Its heads take rewards for judging, and the priests take payment for teaching, and the prophets get silver for reading the future: but still, supporting themselves on the Lord, they say, Is not the Lord among us? no evil will overtake us.";
B._Mic3_12="For this reason, Zion will be ploughed like a field because of you, and Jerusalem will become a mass of broken walls, and the mountain of the house like a high place in the woods.";
B._Mic4_1="But in the last days it will come about that the mountain of the Lord's house will be placed on the top of the mountains, and be lifted up over the hills; and peoples will be flowing to it.";
B._Mic4_2="And a number of nations will go and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will give us knowledge of his ways and we will be guided by his word: for from Zion the law will go out, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.";
B._Mic4_3="And he will be judge between great peoples, and strong nations far away will be ruled by his decisions; their swords will be hammered into plough-blades and their spears into vine-knives: nations will no longer be lifting up their swords against one another, and knowledge of war will have gone for ever.";
B._Mic4_4="But every man will be seated under his vine and under his fig-tree, and no one will be a cause of fear to them: for the mouth of the Lord of armies has said it.";
B._Mic4_5="For all the peoples will be walking, every one in the name of his god, and we will be walking in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.";
B._Mic4_6="In that day, says the Lord, I will get together her who goes with uncertain steps, I will get together her who has been sent away, and her on whom I have sent evil;";
B._Mic4_7="And I will make her whose steps were uncertain a small band, and her who was feeble a strong nation: and the Lord will be their King in Mount Zion from now and for ever.";
B._Mic4_8="And you, O tower of the flock, Ophel of the daughter of Zion, to you it will come, even the earlier authority, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.";
B._Mic4_9="Now why are you crying so loudly? is there no king in you? has destruction come on your wise helper? so that pains have taken you like the pains of a woman in childbirth:";
B._Mic4_10="Be in pain, make sounds of grief, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in childbirth: for now you will go out of the town, living in the open country, and will come even to Babylon; there you will have salvation; there the Lord will make you free from the hands of your haters.";
B._Mic4_11="And now a number of nations have come together against you, and they say, Let her be made unclean and let our eyes see the fate of Zion.";
B._Mic4_12="But they have no knowledge of the thoughts of the Lord, their minds are not able to see his purpose: for he has got them together like stems of grain to the crushing-floor.";
B._Mic4_13="Up! and let the grain be crushed, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron and your feet brass, and a number of peoples will be broken by you, and you will give up their increase to the Lord and their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.";
