B._Exo33_9="And whenever Moses went into the Tent, the pillar of cloud came down, and took its place by the door of the Tent, as long as the Lord was talking with Moses.";
B._Exo33_10="And all the people saw the cloud at the door of the Tent, and they went down on their faces, everyone at the door of his tent.";
B._Exo33_11="And the Lord had talk with Moses face to face, as a man may have talk with his friend. And when Moses came back to the tents, his servant, the young man Joshua, the son of Nun, did not come away from the Tent.";
B._Exo33_12="And Moses said to the Lord, See, you say to me, Be this people's guide on their journey, but you have not made clear to me whom you will send with me. But you have said, I have knowledge of you by name, and you have grace in my eyes.";
B._Exo33_13="If then I have grace in your eyes, let me see your ways, so that I may have knowledge of you and be certain of your grace; and my prayer is that you will keep in mind that this nation is your people.";
B._Exo33_14="And he said, I myself will go with you and give you rest.";
B._Exo33_15="And Moses said, If you yourself are not going with us, do not send us on from here.";
B._Exo33_16="For is not the fact of your going with us the sign that I and this people have grace in your eyes, so that we, that is, I and your people, are separate from all other people on the face of the earth?";
B._Exo33_17="And the Lord said to Moses, I will do as you say: for you have grace in my eyes, and I have knowledge of you by your name.";
B._Exo33_18="And Moses said, O Lord, let me see your glory.";
B._Exo33_19="And he said, I will make all the light of my being come before you, and will make clear to you what I am; I will be kind to those to whom I will be kind, and have mercy on those on whom I will have mercy.";
B._Exo33_20="But it is not possible for you to see my face, for no man may see me and still go on living.";
B._Exo33_21="And the Lord said, See, there is a place near me, and you may take your place on the rock:";
B._Exo33_22="And when my glory goes by, I will put you in a hole in the rock, covering you with my hand till I have gone past:";
B._Exo33_23="Then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back: but my face is not to be seen.";
B._Exo34_1="And the Lord said to Moses, Make two other stones like the first two; and I will put on them the words which were on the first stones, which were broken by you.";
B._Exo34_2="And be ready by the morning, and come up on Mount Sinai, and come before me there in the morning, on the top of the mountain.";
B._Exo34_3="No one is to come up with you, and let no man be seen anywhere on the mountain; let no flocks or herds come near to get their food at its foot.";
B._Exo34_4="So Moses got two stones cut like the first; and early in the morning he went up Mount Sinai, as the Lord had said, with the two stones in his hand.";
B._Exo34_5="And the Lord came down in the cloud and took his place by the side of Moses, and Moses gave worship to the name of the Lord.";
B._Exo34_6="And the Lord went past before his eyes, saying, The Lord, the Lord, a God full of pity and grace, slow to wrath and great in mercy and faith;";
B._Exo34_7="Having mercy on thousands, overlooking evil and wrongdoing and sin; he will not let wrongdoers go free, but will send punishment on children for the sins of their fathers, and on their children's children to the third and fourth generation.";
B._Exo34_8="Then Moses quickly went down on his face in worship.";
B._Exo34_9="And he said, If now I have grace in your eyes, let the Lord go among us, for this is a stiff-necked people, and give us forgiveness for our wrongdoing and our sin, and take us for your heritage.";
B._Exo34_10="And the Lord said, See, this is what I will undertake: before the eyes of your people I will do wonders, such as have not been done in all the earth or in any nation: and all your people will see the work of the Lord, for what I am about to do for you is greatly to be feared.";
B._Exo34_11="Take care to do the orders which I give you today; I will send out from before you the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite.";
B._Exo34_12="But take care, and do not make any agreement with the people of the land where you are going, for it will be a cause of sin to you.";
B._Exo34_13="But their altars are to be overturned and their pillars broken and their images cut down:";
B._Exo34_14="For you are to be worshippers of no other god: for the Lord is a God who will not give his honour to another.";
B._Exo34_15="So see that you make no agreement with the people of the land, and do not go after their gods, or take part in their offerings, or be guests at their feasts,";
B._Exo34_16="Or take their daughters for your sons; for when their daughters give worship before their gods, they will make your sons take part with them.";
B._Exo34_17="Make for yourselves no gods of metal.";
B._Exo34_18="Keep the feast of unleavened bread; for seven days your food is to be bread without leaven, as I gave you orders, at the regular time in the month Abib; for in that month you came out of Egypt.";
B._Exo34_19="Every first male child is mine; the first male birth of your cattle, the first male of every ox and sheep.";
B._Exo34_20="A lamb may be given in payment for the young of an ass, but if you will not make payment for it, its neck will have to be broken. For all the first of your sons you are to make payment. No one is to come before me without an offering.";
B._Exo34_21="Six days let work be done, but on the seventh day take your rest: at ploughing time and at the grain-cutting you are to have a day for rest.";
B._Exo34_22="And you are to keep the feast of weeks when you get in the first-fruits of the grain, and the feast at the turn of the year when you take in the produce of your fields.";
B._Exo34_23="Three times in the year let all your males come before the Lord, the God of Israel.";
B._Exo34_24="For I will send out the nations before you and make wide the limits of your land; and no man will make an attempt to take your land while you go up to give worship to the Lord, three times in the year.";
B._Exo34_25="No leaven is to be offered with the blood of my offering, and the offering of the Passover feast may not be kept till the morning.";
B._Exo34_26="Take the first-fruits of your land as an offering to the house of the Lord your God. Let not the young goat be cooked in its mother's milk";
B._Exo34_27="And the Lord said to Moses, Put all these words in writing; for on them is based the agreement which I will make with you.";
B._Exo34_28="And for forty days and forty nights Moses was there with the Lord, and in that time he had no food or drink. And he put in writing on the stones the words of the agreement, the ten rules of the law.";
B._Exo34_29="Now when Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with the two stones in his hand, he was not conscious that his face was shining because of his talk with God.";
B._Exo34_30="But when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, and the shining of his face, they would not come near him for fear.";
B._Exo34_31="Then Moses sent for them; and Aaron, with the chiefs of the people, came to him; and Moses had talk with them.";
B._Exo34_32="And later, all the children of Israel came near, and he gave them all the orders which the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai.";
B._Exo34_33="And at the end of his talk with them, Moses put a veil over his face.";
B._Exo34_34="But whenever Moses went in before the Lord to have talk with him, he took off the veil till he came out. And whenever he came out he said to the children of Israel what he had been ordered to say;";
B._Exo34_35="And the children of Israel saw that the face of Moses was shining: so Moses put the veil over his face again till he went to the Lord.";
B._Exo35_1="And Moses sent for all the children of Israel to come together, and said to them, This is what the Lord has said and these are his orders.";
B._Exo35_2="Six days let work be done, but the seventh day is to be a holy day to you, a Sabbath of rest to the Lord; whoever does any work on that day is to be put to death.";
B._Exo35_3="No fire is to be lighted in any of your houses on the Sabbath day.";
B._Exo35_4="And Moses said to all the meeting of the children of Israel, This is the order which the Lord has given:";

B._Exo35_21="And everyone whose heart was moved, everyone who was guided by the impulse of his spirit, came with his offering for the Lord, for whatever was needed for the Tent of meeting and its work and for the holy robes.";
B._Exo35_22="They came, men and women, all who were ready to give, and gave pins and nose-rings and finger-rings and neck-ornaments, all of gold; everyone gave an offering of gold to the Lord.";
B._Exo35_23="And everyone who had blue and purple and red and the best linen and goats' hair and sheepskins coloured red and leather, gave them.";
B._Exo35_24="Everyone who had silver and brass gave an offering of them to the Lord; and everyone who had hard wood, such as was needed for the work, gave it.";
B._Exo35_25="And all the women who were expert with their hands, made cloth, and gave the work of their hands, blue and purple and red and the best linen.";
B._Exo35_26="And those women who had the knowledge, made the goats' hair into cloth.";
B._Exo35_27="And the rulers gave the beryls and the cut jewels for the ephod and the priest's bag;";
B._Exo35_28="And the spice and the oil for the light, and the holy oil and the sweet perfumes.";
B._Exo35_29="The children of Israel, every man and woman, from the impulse of their hearts, gave their offerings freely to the Lord for the work which the Lord had given Moses orders to have done.";
B._Exo35_30="And Moses said to the children of Israel, See, the Lord has made selection of Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;";
B._Exo35_31="And he has made him full of the spirit of God, in all wisdom and knowledge and art of every sort;";
B._Exo35_32="As an expert designer of beautiful things, working in gold and silver and brass;";

B._Exo35_35="To them he has given knowledge of all the arts of the handworker, of the designer, and the expert workman; of the maker of needlework in blue and purple and red and the best linen, and of the maker of cloth; in all the arts of the designer and the trained workman they are expert.";
B._Exo36_1="So let Bezalel and Oholiab get to work, with every wise-hearted man to whom the Lord has given wisdom and knowledge, to do whatever is necessary for the ordering of the holy place, as the Lord has given orders.";
B._Exo36_2="Then Moses sent for Bezalel and Oholiab, and for all the wise-hearted men to whom the Lord had given wisdom, even everyone who was moved by the impulse of his heart to come and take part in the work:";
B._Exo36_3="And they took from Moses all the offerings which the children of Israel had given for the building of the holy place. And still they went on giving him more free offerings every morning.";
B._Exo36_4="Then the wise men, who were doing all the work of the holy place, came from their work;";
B._Exo36_5="And said to Moses, The people are giving much more than is needed for the work which the Lord has given us orders to do.";
B._Exo36_6="So Moses made an order and had it given out through all the tents, saying, Let no man or woman make any more offerings for the holy place. So the people were kept from giving more.";
B._Exo36_7="For the material they had was enough and more than enough for all the work which had to be done.";
B._Exo36_8="Then all the expert workmen among them made the House with its ten curtains; of the best linen, blue and purple and red, they made them, with winged ones worked by expert designers.";
