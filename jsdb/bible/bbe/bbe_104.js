B._Isa20_5="And they will be full of fear, and will no longer have faith in Ethiopia which was their hope, or in Egypt which was their glory.";
B._Isa20_6="And those living by the sea will say in that day, See the fate of our hope to whom we went for help and salvation from the king of Assyria: what hope have we then of salvation?";
B._Isa21_1="The word about the waste land. As storm-winds in the South go rushing through, it comes from the waste land, from the land greatly to be feared.";
B._Isa21_2="A vision of fear comes before my eyes; the worker of deceit goes on in his false way, and the waster goes on making waste. Up! Elam; to the attack! Media; I have put an end to her sorrow.";
B._Isa21_3="For this cause I am full of bitter grief; pains like the pains of a woman in childbirth have come on me: I am bent down with sorrow at what comes to my ears; I am shocked by what I see.";
B._Isa21_4="My mind is wandering, fear has overcome me: the evening of my desire has been turned into shaking for me.";
B._Isa21_5="They make ready the table, they put down the covers, they take food and drink. Up! you captains; put oil on your breastplates.";
B._Isa21_6="For so has the Lord said to me, Go, let a watchman be placed; let him give word of what he sees:";

B._Isa21_14="Give water to him who is in need of water; give bread, O men of the land of Tema, to those in flight.";
B._Isa21_15="For they are in flight from the sharp sword, and the bent bow, and from the trouble of war.";

B._Isa22_3="All your rulers ... have gone in flight; all your strong ones have gone far away.";
B._Isa22_4="For this cause I have said, Let your eyes be turned away from me in my bitter weeping; I will not be comforted for the wasting of the daughter of my people.";

B._Isa22_10="And you had the houses of Jerusalem numbered, pulling down the houses to make the wall stronger.";
B._Isa22_11="And you made a place between the two walls for storing the waters of the old pool: but you gave no thought to him who had done this, and were not looking to him by whom it had been purposed long before.";
B._Isa22_12="And in that day the Lord, the Lord of armies, was looking for weeping, and cries of sorrow, cutting off of the hair, and putting on the clothing of grief:";
