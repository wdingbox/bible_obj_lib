B._Act4_35="And put it at the feet of the Apostles for distribution to everyone as he had need.";
B._Act4_36="And Joseph, who was given by the Apostles the name of Barnabas (the sense of which is, Son of comfort), a Levite and a man of Cyprus by birth,";
B._Act4_37="Having a field, got money for it and put the money at the feet of the Apostles.";
B._Act5_1="But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, got money for his property,";
B._Act5_2="And kept back part of the price, his wife having knowledge of it, and took the rest and put it at the feet of the Apostles.";
B._Act5_3="But Peter said, Ananias, why has the Evil One put it into your heart to be false to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?";
B._Act5_4="While you had it, was it not your property? and after you had given it in exchange, was it not still in your power? how has this purpose come into your mind? you have been false, not to men, but to God.";
B._Act5_5="And at these words, Ananias went down on the earth, and his life went from him: and great fear came on all who were present.";
B._Act5_6="And the young men went and made ready his body, and took it out, and put it in the earth.";
B._Act5_7="And about three hours after, his wife, having no knowledge of what had taken place, came in.";
B._Act5_8="And Peter said to her, Give me an answer: was this amount of money the price of the land? And she said, Yes, it was.";
B._Act5_9="But Peter said to her, Why have you made an agreement together to be false to the Spirit of the Lord? See, the feet of the young men who have put the body of your husband in the earth, are at the door, and they will take you out.";

B._Act5_21="And hearing this, they went into the Temple at dawn, and were teaching. But the high priest and those who were with him got together the Sanhedrin and the representatives of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to get them.";
B._Act5_22="But the men who were sent saw that they were not in the prison, and came back with the news,";
B._Act5_23="Saying, The doors of the prison were safely shut, and the keepers were at the doors, but when they were open, there was nobody inside.";
B._Act5_24="Now, at these words, the captain of the Temple and the chief priests were greatly troubled about what might be the end of this business.";

B._Act5_26="Then the captain and some of the police went and took them, but not violently, for fear that they might be stoned by the people.";
B._Act5_27="And they took them into the Sanhedrin, and the high priest said to them,";
B._Act5_28="We gave you very clear orders not to give teaching in this name: and now Jerusalem is full of your teaching, and you are attempting to make us responsible for this man's death.";

B._Act5_35="And he said to them, Men of Israel, take care what you do about these men.";
B._Act5_36="For before this there was Theudas, who said he was someone important, to whom about four hundred men gave their support: he was put to death, and his band was broken up and came to nothing.";
B._Act5_37="After this man, there was Judas of Galilee, at the time of the numbering, and some of the people went after him: he was put to death, and all his supporters were put to flight.";
B._Act5_38="And now I say to you, Do nothing to these men, but let them be: for if this teaching or this work is of men, it will come to nothing:";
B._Act5_39="But if it is of God, you will not be able to overcome them, and you are in danger of fighting against God.";
B._Act5_40="And he seemed to them to be right: and they sent for the Apostles, and, after having them whipped and giving them orders to give no teaching in the name of Jesus, they let them go.";
B._Act5_41="So they went away from the Sanhedrin, happy to undergo shame for the Name.";
B._Act5_42="And every day, in the Temple and privately, they went on teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.";
B._Act6_1="Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was increasing, protests were made by the Greek Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were not taken care of in the distribution of food every day.";
B._Act6_2="And the Apostles sent for all the disciples and said, It is not right for us to give up preaching the word of God in order to make distribution of food.";
B._Act6_3="Take then from among you seven men of good name, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, to whom we may give control of this business.";
B._Act6_4="Then we will give all our time to prayer and the teaching of the word.";

B._Act6_11="Then they got men to say, He has said evil against Moses and against God, in our hearing.";
B._Act6_12="And the people, with the rulers and the scribes, were moved against him, and they came and took him before the Sanhedrin,";
B._Act6_13="And they got false witnesses who said, This man is for ever saying things against this holy place and against the law:";

B._Act6_15="And all those who were in the Sanhedrin, looking at him, saw that his face was like the face of an angel.";
B._Act7_1="Then the high priest said, Are these things true?";
B._Act7_2="And he said, My brothers and fathers, give hearing. The God of glory came to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he was living in Haran,";
B._Act7_3="And said to him, Go out of your land, and away from your family, and come into the land to which I will be your guide.";
B._Act7_4="Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and went into Haran; and from there, when his father was dead, he was guided by God into this land, where you are living now:";

B._Act7_26="And the day after, he came to them, while they were having a fight, and would have made peace between them, saying, Sirs, you are brothers; why do you do wrong to one another?";
B._Act7_27="But the man who was doing wrong to his neighbour, pushing him away, said, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?";
B._Act7_28="Will you put me to death as you did the Egyptian yesterday?";
B._Act7_29="And at these words, Moses went in flight to the land of Midian, and was living there for a time, and had two sons.";
