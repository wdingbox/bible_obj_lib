B._Joe2_28="And after that, it will come about, says the Lord, that I will send my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters will be prophets, your old men will have dreams, your young men will see visions:";
B._Joe2_29="And on the servants and the servant-girls in those days I will send my spirit.";
B._Joe2_30="And I will let wonders be seen in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and pillars of smoke.";
B._Joe2_31="The sun will be made dark and the moon turned to blood, before the great day of the Lord comes, a day to be feared.";
B._Joe2_32="And it will be that whoever makes his prayer to the name of the Lord will be kept safe: for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem some will be kept safe, as the Lord has said, and will be among the small band marked out by the Lord.";
B._Joe3_1="For in those days and in that time, when I let the fate of Judah and Jerusalem be changed,";
B._Joe3_2="I will get together all the nations, and make them come down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; and there I will take up with them the cause of my people and of my heritage Israel, whom they have sent wandering among the nations, and of my land which has been parted by them.";
B._Joe3_3="And they have put the fate of my people to the decision of chance: giving a boy for the price of a loose woman and a girl for a drink of wine.";
B._Joe3_4="And further, what are you to me, O Tyre and Zidon and all the circle of Philistia? will you give me back any payment? and if you do, quickly and suddenly I will send it back on your head,";
B._Joe3_5="For you have taken my silver and my gold, putting in the houses of your gods my beautiful and pleasing things.";
B._Joe3_6="And the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem you have given for a price to the sons of the Greeks, to send them far away from their land:";
B._Joe3_7="See, I will have them moved from the place where you have sent them, and will let what you have done come back on your head;";
B._Joe3_8="I will give your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah for a price, and they will give them for a price to the men of Sheba, a nation far off: for the Lord has said it.";

B._Joe3_10="Get your plough-blades hammered into swords, and your vine-knives into spears: let the feeble say, I am strong.";
B._Joe3_11="Come quickly, all you nations round about, and get yourselves together there: make your strong ones come down, O Lord.";
B._Joe3_12="Let the nations be awake, and come to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there I will be seated as judge of all the nations round about.";
B._Joe3_13="Put in the blade, for the grain is ready: come, get you down, for the wine-crusher is full, the vessels are overflowing; for great is their evil-doing.";
B._Joe3_14="Masses on masses in the valley of decision! for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.";
B._Joe3_15="The sun and the moon have become dark, and the stars keep back their shining.";
B._Joe3_16="And the Lord will be thundering from Zion, and his voice will be sounding from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth will be shaking: but the Lord will be a breastplate for his people and a strong place for the children of Israel.";
B._Joe3_17="And you will be certain that I am the Lord your God, living in Zion, my holy mountain: and Jerusalem will be holy, and no strange person will ever again go through her.";
B._Joe3_18="And it will come about in that day that the mountains will be dropping sweet wine, and the hills will be flowing with milk, and all the streams of Judah will be flowing with water; and a fountain will come out from the house of the Lord, watering the valley of acacia-trees.";
B._Joe3_19="Egypt will be a waste and Edom a land of destruction, because of the evil done to the children of Judah, because they have let blood be drained out in their land without cause.";
B._Joe3_20="But Judah will be peopled for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.";
B._Joe3_21="And I will send punishment for their blood, for which punishment has not been sent, for the Lord is living in Zion.";
B._Amo1_1="The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa; what he saw about Israel in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earth-shock.";

B._Amo1_5="And I will have the locks of the door of Damascus broken, and him who is seated in power cut off from the valley of Aven, and him in whose hand is the rod from the house of Eden; and the people of Aram will go away as prisoners into Kir, says the Lord.";

B._Amo1_11="These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of Edom, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because his sword was turned against his brother, without pity, and his wrath was burning at all times, and he was angry for ever.";
B._Amo1_12="And I will send a fire on Teman, burning up the great houses of Bozrah.";
B._Amo1_13="These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because in Gilead they had women with child cut open, so that they might make wider the limits of their land.";
B._Amo1_14="And I will make a fire in the wall of Rabbah, burning up its great houses, with loud cries in the days of war, with a storm in the day of the great wind:";
B._Amo1_15="And their king will be made prisoner, he and his captains together, says the Lord.";

B._Amo2_3="And I will have the judge cut off from among them, and all their captains I will put to death with him, says the Lord.";
B._Amo2_4="These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of Judah, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because they have given up the law of the Lord, and have not kept his rules; and their false ways, in which their fathers went, have made them go out of the right way.";
B._Amo2_5="And I will send a fire on Judah, burning up the great houses of Jerusalem.";
B._Amo2_6="These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of Israel, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because they have given the upright man for silver, and the poor for the price of two shoes;";

B._Amo4_7="And I have kept back the rain from you, when it was still three months before the grain-cutting: I sent rain on one town and kept it back from another: one part was rained on, and the part where there was no rain became a waste.";
B._Amo4_8="So two or three towns went wandering to one town looking for water, and did not get enough: and still you have not come back to me, says the Lord.";
B._Amo4_9="I have sent destruction on your fields by burning and disease: the increase of your gardens and your vine-gardens, your fig-trees and your olive-trees, has been food for worms: and still you have not come back to me, says the Lord.";
B._Amo4_10="I have sent disease among you, as it was in Egypt: I have put your young men to the sword, and have taken away your horses; I have made the evil smell from your tents come up to your noses: and still you have not come back to me, says the Lord.";
B._Amo4_11="And I have sent destruction among you, as when God sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were like a burning stick pulled out of the fire: and still you have not come back to me, says the Lord.";

B._Amo5_8="Go for help to him who makes Orion and the Pleiades, by whom the deep dark is turned into morning, who makes the day black with night; whose voice goes out to the waters of the sea, sending them out over the face of the earth: the Lord is his name;";
B._Amo5_9="Who sends sudden destruction on the strong, so that destruction comes on the walled town.";
B._Amo5_10="They have hate for him who makes protest against evil in the public place, and he whose words are upright is disgusting to them.";
B._Amo5_11="So because the poor man is crushed under your feet, and you take taxes from him of grain: you have made for yourselves houses of cut stone, but you will not take your rest in them; the fair vine-gardens planted by your hands will not give you wine.";
B._Amo5_12="For I have seen how your evil-doing is increased and how strong are your sins, you troublers of the upright, who take rewards and do wrong to the cause of the poor in the public place.";
B._Amo5_13="So the wise will say nothing in that time; for it is an evil time.";
B._Amo5_14="Go after good and not evil, so that life may be yours: and so the Lord, the God of armies, will be with you, as you say.";
B._Amo5_15="Be haters of evil and lovers of good, and let right be done in the public place: it may be that the Lord, the God of armies, will have mercy on the rest of Joseph.";
B._Amo5_16="So these are the words of the Lord, the God of armies, the Lord: There will be weeping in all the open spaces; and in all the streets they will say, Sorrow! sorrow! and they will get in the farmer to the weeping, and the makers of sad songs to give cries of grief.";
B._Amo5_17="In all the vine-gardens there will be cries of grief: for I will go through among you, says the Lord.";
B._Amo5_18="Sorrow to you who are looking for the day of the Lord! what is the day of the Lord to you? it is dark and not light.";
B._Amo5_19="As if a man, running away from a lion, came face to face with a bear; or went into the house and put his hand on the wall and got a bite from a snake.";
B._Amo5_20="Will not the day of the Lord be dark and not light? even very dark, with no light shining in it?";
B._Amo5_21="Your feasts are disgusting to me, I will have nothing to do with them; I will take no delight in your holy meetings.";
B._Amo5_22="Even if you give me your burned offerings and your meal offerings, I will not take pleasure in them: I will have nothing to do with the peace-offerings of your fat beasts.";
B._Amo5_23="Take away from me the noise of your songs; my ears are shut to the melody of your instruments.";
B._Amo5_24="But let the right go rolling on like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.";
B._Amo5_25="Did you come to me with offerings of beasts and meal offerings in the waste land for forty years, O Israel?";
B._Amo5_26="Truly, you will take up Saccuth your king and Kaiwan your images, the star of your god, which you made for yourselves.";
B._Amo5_27="And I will send you away as prisoners farther than Damascus, says the Lord, whose name is the God of armies.";
B._Amo6_1="Sorrow to those who are resting in comfort in Zion, and to those who have no fear of danger in the mountain of Samaria, the noted men of the chief of the nations, to whom the people of Israel come!";
B._Amo6_2="Go on to Calneh and see; and from there go to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines: are you better than these kingdoms? or is your land wider than theirs?";
B._Amo6_3="You who put far away the evil day, causing the rule of the violent to come near;";
B._Amo6_4="Who are resting on beds of ivory, stretched out on soft seats, feasting on lambs from the flock and young oxen from the cattle-house;";
B._Amo6_5="Making foolish songs to the sound of corded instruments, and designing for themselves instruments of music, like David;";
B._Amo6_6="Drinking wine in basins, rubbing themselves with the best oils; but they have no grief for the destruction of Joseph.";
B._Amo6_7="So now they will go away prisoners with the first of those who are made prisoners, and the loud cry of those who were stretched out will come to an end.";
B._Amo6_8="The Lord God has taken an oath by himself, says the Lord, the God of armies: the pride of Jacob is disgusting to me, and I have hate for his great houses: so I will give up the town with everything in it.";
B._Amo6_9="Then it will come about that if there are still ten men in a house, death will overtake them.";
B._Amo6_10="And when a man's relation, even the one who is responsible for burning his body, lifting him up to take his bones out of the house, says to him who is in the inmost part of the house, Is there still anyone with you? and he says, No; then he will say, Keep quiet, for the name of the Lord may not be named.";
B._Amo6_11="For see, at the order of the Lord the great house will be full of cracks and the little house will be broken.";
B._Amo6_12="Is it possible for horses to go running on the rock? may the sea be ploughed with oxen? for the right to be turned by you into poison, and the fruit of righteousness into a bitter plant?";
B._Amo6_13="You whose joy is in a thing of no value, who say, Have we not taken for ourselves horns by the strength which is ours?";
B._Amo6_14="For see, I will send against you a nation, O Israel, says the Lord, the God of armies, ruling you cruelly from the way into Hamath as far as the stream of the Arabah.";
B._Amo7_1="This is what the Lord God let me see: and I saw that, when the growth of the late grass was starting, he made locusts; it was the late growth after the king's cutting was done.";
B._Amo7_2="And it came about that after they had taken all the grass of the land, I said, O Lord God, have mercy: how will Jacob be able to keep his place? for he is small.";
B._Amo7_3="The Lord, changing his purpose about this, said, It will not be.";
B._Amo7_4="This is what the Lord let me see: and I saw that the Lord God sent for a great fire to be the instrument of his punishment; and, after burning up the great deep, it was about to put an end to the Lord's heritage.";
B._Amo7_5="Then said I, O Lord God, let there be an end: how will Jacob be able to keep his place? for he is small.";
B._Amo7_6="The Lord, changing his purpose about this, said, And this will not be.";
B._Amo7_7="This is what he let me see: and I saw the Lord stationed by a wall made straight by a weighted line, and he had a weighted line in his hand.";
B._Amo7_8="And the Lord said to me, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A weighted line. Then the Lord said, See, I will let down a weighted line among my people Israel; never again will my eyes be shut to their sin:";
B._Amo7_9="And the high places of Isaac will be unpeopled, and the holy places of Israel will be made waste; and I will come up against the family of Jeroboam with the sword.";
B._Amo7_10="Then Amaziah, the priest of Beth-el, sent to Jeroboam, king of Israel, saying, Amos has made designs against you among the people of Israel: the land is troubled by his words.";
B._Amo7_11="For Amos has said, Jeroboam will be put to the sword, and Israel will certainly be taken away as a prisoner out of his land.";
B._Amo7_12="And Amaziah said to Amos, O seer, go in flight into the land of Judah, and there get your living by working as a prophet:";
B._Amo7_13="But be a prophet no longer at Beth-el: for it is the holy place of the king, and the king's house.";
B._Amo7_14="Then Amos in answer said to Amaziah, I am no prophet, or one of the sons of the prophets; I am a herdman and one who takes care of sycamore-trees:";
B._Amo7_15="And the Lord took me from the flock, and the Lord said to me, Go, be a prophet to my people Israel.";
B._Amo7_16="Now then, give ear to the word of the Lord: You say, Be no prophet to Israel, and say not a word against the people of Isaac.";
B._Amo7_17="So this is what the Lord has said: Your wife will be a loose woman in the town, and your sons and your daughters will be put to the sword, and your land will be cut up into parts by a line; and you yourself will come to your end in an unclean land, and Israel will certainly be taken away a prisoner out of his land.";
B._Amo8_1="This is what the Lord God let me see: and I saw a basket of summer fruit.";
B._Amo8_2="And he said, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then the Lord said to me, The end has come to my people Israel; never again will my eyes be shut to their sin.";
B._Amo8_3="And the songs of the king's house will be cries of pain in that day, says the Lord God: great will be the number of the dead bodies, and everywhere they will put them out without a word.";
B._Amo8_4="Give ear to this, you who are crushing the poor, and whose purpose is to put an end to those who are in need in the land,";
B._Amo8_5="Saying, When will the new moon be gone, so that we may do trade in grain? and the Sabbath, so that we may put out in the market the produce of our fields? making the measure small and the price great, and trading falsely with scales of deceit;";
B._Amo8_6="Getting the poor for silver, and him who is in need for the price of two shoes, and taking a price for the waste parts of the grain.";
B._Amo8_7="The Lord has taken an oath by the pride of Jacob, Truly I will ever keep in mind all their works.";
B._Amo8_8="Will not the land be shaking with fear because of this, and everyone in it have sorrow? and all of it will be overflowing like the River; and it will be troubled and go down again like the River of Egypt.";
