B._Jos7_14="So in the morning you are to come near, tribe by tribe; and the tribe marked out by the Lord is to come near, family by family; and the family marked out by the Lord is to come near, house by house; and the house marked out by the Lord is to come near, man by man.";
B._Jos7_15="Then the man who is taken with the cursed thing is to be burned, with everything which is his; because he has gone against the agreement of the Lord and has done an act of shame in Israel.";
B._Jos7_16="So Joshua got up early in the morning, and made Israel come before him by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken;";
B._Jos7_17="Then he made Judah come forward, and the family of the Zerahites was taken; and he made the family of the Zerahites come forward man by man; and Zabdi was taken;";
B._Jos7_18="Then the house of Zabdi came forward man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.";
B._Jos7_19="And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give glory and praise to the Lord, the God of Israel; give me word now of what you have done, and keep nothing back from me.";
B._Jos7_20="And Achan, answering, said to Joshua, Truly I have done wrong against the Lord, the God of Israel, and this is what I have done:";
B._Jos7_21="When I saw among their goods a fair robe of Babylon and two hundred shekels of silver, and a mass of gold, fifty shekels in weight, I was overcome by desire and took them; and they are put away in the earth in my tent, and the silver is under it.";
B._Jos7_22="So Joshua sent men quickly, and looking in his tent, they saw where the robe had been put away secretly with the silver under it.";
B._Jos7_23="And they took them from the tent and came back with them to Joshua and the children of Israel, and put them before the Lord.";
B._Jos7_24="Then Joshua and all Israel took Achan, the son of Zerah, and the silver and the robe and the mass of gold, and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and everything he had; and they took them up into the valley of Achor.";
B._Jos7_25="And Joshua said, Why have you been a cause of trouble to us? Today the Lord will send trouble on you. And all Israel took part in stoning him; they had him stoned to death and then burned with fire.";
B._Jos7_26="And over him they put a great mass of stones, which is there to this day; then the heat of the Lord's wrath was turned away. So that place was named, The Valley of Achor, to this day.";
B._Jos8_1="Then the Lord said to Joshua, Have no fear and do not be troubled: take with you all the fighting-men and go up against Ai: for I have given into your hands the king of Ai and his people and his town and his land:";
B._Jos8_2="And you are to do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king: but their goods and their cattle you may take for yourselves: let a secret force be stationed to make a surprise attack on the town from the back.";
B._Jos8_3="So Joshua and the fighting-men got ready to go up against Ai; and Joshua took thirty thousand men of war, and sent them out by night.";
B._Jos8_4="And he gave them their orders, saying, Go and take up your position secretly at the back of the town: do not go very far away, and let all of you be ready:";
B._Jos8_5="And I and all the people with me will come near the town, and when they come out against us as they did before, we will go in flight from them;";
B._Jos8_6="And they will come out after us, till we have got them away from the town; for they will say, They have gone in flight from us as before; so we will go in flight before them;";
B._Jos8_7="Then you will get up from your secret position and take the town, for the Lord your God will give it up into your hands.";
B._Jos8_8="And when you have taken the town, put fire to it, as the Lord has said: see, I have given you your orders.";
B._Jos8_9="So Joshua sent them out: and they took up a secret position between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua kept with the people that night.";
B._Jos8_10="And early in the morning Joshua got up, and put the people in order, and he and the chiefs of Israel went up before the people to Ai.";
B._Jos8_11="And all the fighting-men who were with him went up and came near the town, and took up a position on the north side of Ai facing the town, with a valley between him and the town.";
B._Jos8_12="And taking about five thousand men, he put them in position for a surprise attack on the west side of Ai, between Beth-el and Ai.";
B._Jos8_13="So all the people were in their places, the army on the north side of the town and the secret force on the west; and that night Joshua went down into the valley.";
B._Jos8_14="Now when the king of Ai saw it, he got up quickly and went out to war against Israel, he and all his people, to the slope going down to the valley; but he had no idea that a secret force was waiting at the back of the town.";
B._Jos8_15="Then Joshua and all Israel, acting as if they were overcome before them, went in flight by way of the waste land.";
B._Jos8_16="And all the people in Ai came together to go after them; and they went after Joshua, moving away from the town.";
B._Jos8_17="There was not a man in Ai and Beth-el who did not go out after Israel; and the town was open and unwatched while they went after Israel.";
B._Jos8_18="And the Lord said to Joshua, Let your spear be stretched out against Ai; for I will give it into your hands. So Joshua took up his spear, stretching it out in the direction of the town.";
B._Jos8_19="Then the secret force came quickly from their place, and running forward when they saw his hand stretched out, went into the town and took it, and put fire to it straight away.";
B._Jos8_20="Then the men of Ai, looking back, saw the smoke of the town going up to heaven, and were unable to go this way or that: and the people who had gone in flight to the waste land were turned back on those who were coming after them.";
B._Jos8_21="And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the town had been taken by the surprise attack, and that the smoke of the town had gone up, turning round they overcame the men of Ai.";
B._Jos8_22="Then the other force came out of the town against them, so that they were being attacked on this side and on that: and Israel overcame them and let not one of them get away with his life.";
B._Jos8_23="But the king of Ai they made prisoner, and took him to Joshua.";
B._Jos8_24="Then, after the destruction of all the people of Ai in the field and in the waste land where they went after them, and when all the people had been put to death without mercy, all Israel went back to Ai, and put to death all who were in it without mercy.";
B._Jos8_25="On that day twelve thousand were put to death, men and women, all the people of Ai.";
B._Jos8_26="For Joshua did not take back his hand with the outstretched spear till the destruction of the people of Ai was complete.";
B._Jos8_27="But the cattle and the goods from that town, Israel took for themselves, as the Lord had given orders to Joshua.";
B._Jos8_28="So Joshua gave Ai to the flames, and made it a waste mass of stones for ever, as it is to this day.";
B._Jos8_29="And he put the king of Ai to death, hanging him on a tree till evening: and when the sun went down, Joshua gave them orders to take his body down from the tree, and put it in the public place of the town, covering it with a great mass of stones, which is there to this day.";
B._Jos8_30="Then Joshua put up an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,";
B._Jos8_31="In the way ordered by Moses, the servant of the Lord, as it is recorded in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones, untouched by any iron instrument: and on it they made burned offerings and peace-offerings to the Lord.";
B._Jos8_32="And he made there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, writing it before the eyes of the children of Israel.";
B._Jos8_33="And all Israel, those who were Israelites by birth, as well as the men from other lands living with them, and their responsible men and their overseers and judges, took their places round the ark, in front of the priests, the Levites, whose work it was to take up the ark of the Lord's agreement; half of them were stationed in front of Mount Gerizim and half in front of Mount Ebal, in agreement with the orders for the blessing of the children of Israel which Moses, the servant of the Lord, had given.";
B._Jos8_34="And after, he gave them all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, as it is all recorded in the book of the law;";
B._Jos8_35="Reading to all the meeting of Israel, with the women and the children and the men from other lands who were living among them, every word of the orders which Moses had given.";
B._Jos9_1="Now on hearing the news of these things, all the kings on the west side of Jordan, in the hill-country and the lowlands and by the Great Sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites,";
B._Jos9_2="Came together with one purpose, to make war against Joshua and Israel.";
B._Jos9_3="And the men of Gibeon, hearing what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,";
B._Jos9_4="Acting with deceit, got food together as if for a long journey; and took old food-bags for their asses, and old and cracked wine-skins kept together with cord;";
B._Jos9_5="And put old stitched-up shoes on their feet, and old clothing on their backs; and all the food they had with them was dry and broken up.";
B._Jos9_6="And they came to Joshua to the tent-circle at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, We have come from a far country: so now make an agreement with us.";
B._Jos9_7="And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, It may be that you are living among us; how then may we make an agreement with you?";
B._Jos9_8="And they said to Joshua, We are your servants. Then Joshua said to them, Who are you and where do you come from?";
B._Jos9_9="And they said to him, Your servants have come from a very far country, because of the name of the Lord your God: for the story of his great name, and of all he did in Egypt has come to our ears,";
B._Jos9_10="And what he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of Jordan, to Sihon, king of Heshbon, and to Og, king of Bashan, at Ashtaroth.";
B._Jos9_11="So the responsible men and all the people of our country said to us, Take food with you for the journey and go to them, and say to them, We are your servants: so now make an agreement with us.";
B._Jos9_12="This bread which we have with us for our food, we took warm and new from our houses when starting on our journey to you; but now see, it has become dry and broken up.";
B._Jos9_13="And these wine-skins were new when we put the wine in them, and now they are cracked as you see; and our clothing and our shoes have become old because of our very long journey here.";
B._Jos9_14="And the men took some of their food, without requesting directions from the Lord.";
B._Jos9_15="So Joshua made peace with them, and made an agreement with them that they were not to be put to death: and the chiefs of the people took an oath to them.";
B._Jos9_16="Now three days after, when they had made this agreement with them, they had word that these men were their neighbours, living near them.";
B._Jos9_17="And the children of Israel went forward on their journey, and on the third day came to their towns. Now their towns were Gibeon and Chephirah and Beeroth and Kiriath-jearim.";
B._Jos9_18="And the children of Israel did not put them to death, because the chiefs of the people had taken an oath to them by the Lord, the God of Israel. And all the people made an outcry against the chiefs.";
B._Jos9_19="But all the chiefs said to the people, We have taken an oath to them by the Lord, the God of Israel, and so we may not put our hands on them.";
B._Jos9_20="This is what we will do to them: we will not put them to death, for fear that wrath may come on us because of our oath to them.";
B._Jos9_21="Keep them living, and let them be servants, cutting wood and getting water for all the people. And all the people did as the chiefs had said to them.";
B._Jos9_22="Then Joshua sent for them, and said to them, Why have you been false to us, saying, We are very far from you, when you are living among us?";
B._Jos9_23="Now because of this you are cursed, and you will for ever be our servants, cutting wood and getting water for the house of my God.";
B._Jos9_24="And, answering Joshua, they said, Because it came to the ears of your servants that the Lord your God had given orders to his servant Moses to give you all this land, and to send destruction on all the people living in it, because of you; so, fearing greatly for our lives because of you, we have done this.";
B._Jos9_25="And now we are in your hands: do to us whatever seems good and right to you.";
B._Jos9_26="So he kept them safe from the children of Israel, and did not let them be put to death.";
B._Jos9_27="And that day Joshua made them servants, cutting wood and getting water for the people and for the altar of the Lord, in the place marked out by him, to this day.";
B._Jos10_1="Now when it came to the ears of Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, that Joshua had taken Ai, and had given it up to the curse (for as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king); and that the people of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were living among them;";
B._Jos10_2="He was in great fear, because Gibeon was a great town, like one of the king's towns, greater than Ai, and all the men in it were men of war.";
B._Jos10_3="So Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, sent to Hoham, king of Hebron, and to Piram, king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia, king of Lachish, and to Debir, king of Eglon, saying,";
B._Jos10_4="Come up to me and give me help, and let us make an attack on Gibeon: for they have made peace with Joshua and the children of Israel.";
B._Jos10_5="So the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, were banded together, and went up with all their armies and took up their position before Gibeon and made war against it.";
B._Jos10_6="And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the tent-circle at Gilgal, saying, Be not slow to send help to your servants; come up quickly to our support and keep us safe: for all the kings of the Amorites from the hill-country have come together against us.";
B._Jos10_7="So Joshua went up from Gilgal with all his army and all his men of war.";
B._Jos10_8="And the Lord said to Joshua, Have no fear of them, for I have given them into your hands; they will all give way before you.";
B._Jos10_9="So Joshua, having come up from Gilgal all night, made a sudden attack on them.";
B._Jos10_10="And the Lord made them full of fear before Israel, and they put great numbers of them to death at Gibeon, and went after them by the way going up to Beth-horon, driving them back to Azekah and Makkedah";
B._Jos10_11="And in their flight before Israel, on the way down from Beth-horon, the Lord sent down great stones from heaven on them all the way to Azekah, causing their death: those whose death was caused by the stones were more than those whom the children of Israel put to death with the sword.";
B._Jos10_12="It was on the day when the Lord gave up the Amorites into the hands of the children of Israel that Joshua said to the Lord, before the eyes of Israel, Sun, be at rest over Gibeon; and you, O moon, in the valley of Aijalon.";
B._Jos10_13="And the sun was at rest and the moon kept its place till the nation had given punishment to their attackers. (Is it not recorded in the book of Jashar?) So the sun kept its place in the middle of the heavens, and was waiting, and did not go down, for the space of a day.";
B._Jos10_14="And there was no day like that, before it or after it, when the Lord gave ear to the voice of a man; for the Lord was fighting for Israel.";
B._Jos10_15="And Joshua, with all Israel, went back to the tent-circle at Gilgal.";
B._Jos10_16="But these five kings went in flight secretly to a hole in the rock at Makkedah.";
B._Jos10_17="And word was given to Joshua that the five kings had been taken in a hole in the rock at Makkedah.";
B._Jos10_18="And Joshua said, Let great stones be rolled against the mouth of the hole, and let men keep watch by it:";
B._Jos10_19="But do you, without waiting, go after their army, attacking them from the back; do not let them get into their towns, for the Lord your God has given them into your hands.";
B._Jos10_20="Now when Joshua and the children of Israel had come to the end of their war of complete destruction, and had put to death all but a small band who had got safely into the walled towns,";
B._Jos10_21="All the people went back to Joshua to the tent-circle at Makkedah in peace: and no one said a word against the children of Israel.";
B._Jos10_22="Then Joshua said, Take away the stones from the mouth of the hole in the rock, and make those five kings come out to me.";
B._Jos10_23="And they did so, and made those five kings come out of the hole to him, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.";
B._Jos10_24="And when they had made those kings come out to Joshua, Joshua sent for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, Come near and put your feet on the necks of these kings. So they came near and put their feet on their necks.";
B._Jos10_25="And Joshua said to them, Have no fear and do not be troubled; be strong and take heart: for so will the Lord do to all against whom you make war.";
B._Jos10_26="Then Joshua had them put to death, hanging them on five trees, where they were till evening.";
B._Jos10_27="And when the sun went down, they were taken down from the trees, by Joshua's orders, and put into the hole where they had gone to be safe; and great stones were placed at the mouth of the hole, where they are to this day.";
B._Jos10_28="That day Joshua took Makkedah, and put it and its king to the sword; every soul in it he gave up to the curse without mercy: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.";
B._Jos10_29="Then Joshua and all Israel with him went on from Makkedah and came to Libnah, and made an attack on it;";
B._Jos10_30="And again the Lord gave it and its king into the hands of Israel; and he put it and every person in it to the sword, till their destruction was complete; and he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.";
B._Jos10_31="Then Joshua and all Israel with him went on from Libnah to Lachish, and took up their position against it and made an attack on it,";
B._Jos10_32="And the Lord gave Lachish into the hands of Israel, and on the second day he took it, putting it and every person in it to the sword without mercy, as he had done to Libnah.";
B._Jos10_33="Then Horam, king of Gezer, came up to the help of Lachish; and Joshua overcame him and his people, putting all of them to death.";
B._Jos10_34="And Joshua and all Israel with him went on from Lachish to Eglon: and they took up their position against it and made an attack on it;";
B._Jos10_35="And that day they took it, putting it and every person in it to the sword, as he had done to Lachish.";
B._Jos10_36="And Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron, and made an attack on it;";
B._Jos10_37="And took it, overcoming it and putting it and its king and its towns and every person in it to the sword: as he had done to Eglon, he put them all to death, and gave it up to the curse with every person in it.";
B._Jos10_38="And Joshua and all Israel with him went on to make an attack on Debir;";
B._Jos10_39="And he took it, with its king and all its towns: and he put them to the sword, giving every person in it to the curse; all were put to death: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king.";
B._Jos10_40="So Joshua overcame all the land, the hill-country and the South and the lowland and the mountain slopes, and all their kings; all were put to death: and every living thing he gave up to the curse, as the Lord, the God of Israel, had given him orders.";
B._Jos10_41="Joshua overcame them from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, and all the land of Goshen as far as Gibeon.";
B._Jos10_42="And all these kings and their land Joshua took at the same time, because the Lord, the God of Israel, was fighting for Israel.";
B._Jos10_43="Then Joshua and all Israel with him went back to their tents at Gilgal.";
B._Jos11_1="Now Jabin, king of Hazor, hearing of these things, sent to Jobab, king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,";
B._Jos11_2="And to the kings on the north in the hill-country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the highlands of Dor on the west,";
B._Jos11_3="And to the Canaanites on the east and on the west, and to the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the hill-country, and the Hivites under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.";
B._Jos11_4="And they went out, they and all their armies with them, a great people, in number like the sand on the seaside, with horses and war-carriages in great number.";
B._Jos11_5="And all these kings came together, and put their forces in position at the waters of Merom, to make war on Israel.";
B._Jos11_6="And the Lord said to Joshua, Have no fear of them: for tomorrow at this time I will give them all up dead before Israel; you are to have the leg-muscles of their horses cut and their war-carriages burned with fire.";
B._Jos11_7="So Joshua and all the men of war with him came against them suddenly at the waters of Merom, and made an attack on them.";
B._Jos11_8="And the Lord gave them up into the hands of Israel, and they overcame them driving them back to great Zidon and to Misrephoth-maim and into the valley of Mizpeh to the east; and they put them all to death, no man got away safely.";
B._Jos11_9="And Joshua did to them as the Lord had said to him; he had the leg-muscles of their horses cut and their war-carriages burned with fire.";
B._Jos11_10="At that time, Joshua went on to take Hazor and put its king to the sword: for in earlier times Hazor was the chief of all those kingdoms.";
B._Jos11_11="And they put every person in it to death without mercy, giving every living thing up to the curse, and burning Hazor.";
B._Jos11_12="And all the towns of these kings, and all the kings, Joshua took, and put them to the sword: he gave them up to the curse, as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had said.";
B._Jos11_13="As for the towns made on hills of earth, not one was burned by Israel but Hazor, which was burned by Joshua.";
B._Jos11_14="And all the goods taken from these towns, and their cattle, the children of Israel kept for themselves; but every man they put to death without mercy, till their destruction was complete, and there was no one living.";
B._Jos11_15="As the Lord had given orders to Moses his servant, so Moses gave orders to Joshua, and so Joshua did; every order which the Lord had given to Moses was done.";
B._Jos11_16="So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland and the Arabah, the hill-country of Israel and its lowland;";
B._Jos11_17="From Mount Halak, which goes up to Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon: and all their kings he overcame and put to death.";
B._Jos11_18="For a long time Joshua made war on all those kings.";
B._Jos11_19="Not one town made peace with the children of Israel, but only the Hivites of Gibeon: they took them all in war.";
B._Jos11_20="For the Lord made them strong in heart to go to war against Israel, so that he might give them up to the curse without mercy, and that destruction might come on them, as the Lord had given orders to Moses.";
B._Jos11_21="And Joshua came at that time and put an end to the Anakim in the hill-country, in Hebron, in Debir, in Anab, and in all the hill-country of Judah and Israel: Joshua gave them and their towns to the curse.";
B._Jos11_22="Not one of the Anakim was to be seen in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, some were still living.";
B._Jos11_23="So Joshua took all the land, as the Lord had said to Moses; and Joshua gave it to the children of Israel as their heritage, making division of it among them by their tribes. And the land had rest from war.";
B._Jos12_1="Now these are the kings of the land whom the children of Israel overcame, taking as their heritage their land on the east side of Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah to the east:";
B._Jos12_2="Sihon, king of the Amorites, who was living in Heshbon, ruling from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the town in the middle of the valley, and half Gilead, as far as the river Jabbok, the limits of the children of Ammon;";
B._Jos12_3="And the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth, to the east, and to the sea of the Arabah, that is the Salt Sea, to the east, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:";
