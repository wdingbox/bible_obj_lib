B._Act9_20="And straight away, in the Synagogues, he was preaching Jesus as the Son of God.";
B._Act9_21="And all those hearing him were full of wonder and said, Is not this the man who in Jerusalem was attacking all the worshippers of this name? and he had come here so that he might take them as prisoners before the chief priests.";
B._Act9_22="But Saul went on increasing in power, and the Jews in Damascus were not able to give answers to the arguments by which he made it clear that Jesus was the Christ.";
B._Act9_23="Then, after some days, the Jews made an agreement together to put him to death:";
B._Act9_24="But Saul got knowledge of their design. And they kept watch day and night on the roads out of the town, so that they might put him to death:";
B._Act9_25="But his disciples took him by night and let him down from the wall in a basket.";
B._Act9_26="And when he came to Jerusalem, he made an attempt to be joined to the disciples, but they were all in fear of him, not taking him for a disciple.";
B._Act9_27="But Barnabas took him to the Apostles and gave them an account of how he had seen the Lord on the road, and had given hearing to his words, and how at Damascus he had been preaching in the name of Jesus without fear.";
B._Act9_28="And he was with them, going in and out at Jerusalem,";
B._Act9_29="Preaching in the name of the Lord without fear; and he had discussions with the Greek Jews; but they were working for his death.";
B._Act9_30="And when the brothers had knowledge of it, they took him to Caesarea and sent him to Tarsus.";

B._Act9_35="And all those living in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and were turned to the Lord.";
B._Act9_36="Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, that is, Dorcas: this woman was given to good works and acts of mercy at all times.";
B._Act9_37="And it came about, in those days, that she got ill and came to her death: and when she had been washed, they put her in a room which was high up.";
B._Act9_38="And because Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having knowledge that Peter was there, sent two men to him, requesting him to come to them straight away.";
B._Act9_39="And Peter went with them. And when he had come, they took him into the room: and all the widows were there, weeping and putting before him the coats and clothing which Dorcas had made while she was with them.";
B._Act9_40="But Peter made them all go outside, and went down on his knees in prayer; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, get up. And, opening her eyes, she saw Peter and got up.";

B._Act10_6="Who is living with Simon, a leather-worker, whose house is by the sea.";
B._Act10_7="And when the angel who said these words to him had gone away, he sent for two of his house-servants, and a God-fearing man of the army, one of those who were waiting on him at all times;";

B._Act10_9="Now the day after, when they were on their journey and were near the town, Peter went up to the top of the house for prayer, about the sixth hour:";
B._Act10_10="And he was in need of food: but while they were getting it ready, a deep sleep came on him;";
B._Act10_11="And he saw the heavens opening, and a vessel coming down, like a great cloth let down on the earth,";
B._Act10_12="In which were all sorts of beasts and birds.";
B._Act10_13="And a voice came to him, saying, Come, Peter; take them for food.";
B._Act10_14="But Peter said, No, Lord; for I have never taken food which is common or unclean.";
B._Act10_15="And the voice came to him a second time, What God has made clean, do not you make common.";
B._Act10_16="And this was done three times: and then the vessel was taken back into heaven.";
B._Act10_17="Now while Peter was in doubt as to the purpose of this vision, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made search for Simon's house, came to the door,";
B._Act10_18="To see if Simon, named Peter, was living there.";
B._Act10_19="And, while Peter was turning the vision over in his mind, the Spirit said to him, See, three men are looking for you.";
B._Act10_20="Go down, then, and go with them, doubting nothing, for I have sent them.";
B._Act10_21="And Peter went down to the men, and said, I am the man you are looking for: why have you come?";
B._Act10_22="And they said, Cornelius, a captain, an upright and God-fearing man, respected by all the nation of the Jews, had word from God by an angel to send for you to his house, and to give hearing to your words.";
B._Act10_23="So he took them in for the night. And the day after, he went with them, taking some of the brothers from Joppa with him.";
B._Act10_24="And the day after that, they came to Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having got together his relations and his near friends.";
B._Act10_25="And when Peter came in, Cornelius came to him and, falling down at his feet, gave him worship.";

B._Act10_27="And saying these words, he went in, and saw that a great number of people had come together;";
B._Act10_28="And he said to them, You yourselves have knowledge that it is against the law for a man who is a Jew to be in the company of one who is of another nation; but God has made it clear to me that no man may be named common or unclean:";
B._Act10_29="And so I came without question, when I was sent for. What then is your purpose in sending for me?";
B._Act10_30="And Cornelius said, Four days from now I was in my house in prayer at the ninth hour; and I saw before me a man in shining clothing,";
B._Act10_31="Who said, Cornelius, your prayer has come to the ears of God, and your offerings are kept in his memory.";
B._Act10_32="Send, then, to Joppa, and get Simon, named Peter, to come to you; he is living in the house of Simon, a leather-worker, by the sea.";

B._Act10_43="To him all the prophets give witness, that through his name everyone who has faith in him will have forgiveness of sins.";
B._Act10_44="While Peter was saying these words, the Holy Spirit came on all those who were hearing the word.";
B._Act10_45="And the Jews of the faith, who had come with Peter, were full of wonder, because the Holy Spirit was given to the Gentiles,";
B._Act10_46="And they were talking in tongues, and giving glory to God. Then Peter said,";
B._Act10_47="Will any man say that these may not have baptism who have been given the Holy Spirit as we have?";
B._Act10_48="And he gave orders for them to have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they kept him with them for some days.";

B._Act11_3="Saying, You went to men without circumcision, and took food with them.";
B._Act11_4="But Peter gave them an account of it all in order, saying to them,";
B._Act11_5="I was in the town of Joppa, at prayer: and falling into a deep sleep, I saw in a vision a vessel like a great cloth let down from heaven, and it came down to me:";
B._Act11_6="And looking on it with attention I saw in it all sorts of beasts and birds.";
B._Act11_7="And a voice came to my ears saying, Come, Peter; take them for food.";
B._Act11_8="But I said, No, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever come into my mouth.";
B._Act11_9="But the voice, coming a second time from heaven, said, What God has made clean, do not you make common.";
B._Act11_10="And this was done three times, and they were all taken up again into heaven.";
B._Act11_11="And at that minute, three men, sent from Caesarea, came to the house where we were.";
B._Act11_12="And the Spirit gave me orders to go with them, doubting nothing. And these six brothers came with me; and we went into that man's house:";
B._Act11_13="And he gave us an account of how he had seen the angel in his house, saying, Send to Joppa, and get Simon, named Peter, to come to you;";

B._Act11_15="And, while I was talking to them, the Holy Spirit came on them, as on us at first.";
B._Act11_16="And the words of the Lord came into my mind, how he said, The baptism of John was with water, but you will have baptism with the Holy Spirit.";
B._Act11_17="If then God gave them, when they had faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the same as he gave to us, who was I to go against God?";
B._Act11_18="And hearing these things they said nothing more, but gave glory to God, saying, Then to the Gentiles as to us has God given a change of heart, so that they may have life.";

B._Act11_24="For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and a great number were joined to the Lord.";
B._Act11_25="Then he went on to Tarsus, looking for Saul;";
B._Act11_26="And when he had come across him, he took him to Antioch. And they were with the church there for a year, teaching the people; and the disciples were first given the name of Christians in Antioch.";
B._Act11_27="Now in those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.";
B._Act11_28="And one of them, named Agabus, said publicly through the Spirit that there would be serious need of food all over the earth: which came about in the time of Claudius.";
B._Act11_29="And the disciples, everyone as he was able, made a decision to send help to the brothers living in Judaea:";
B._Act11_30="Which they did, sending it to the rulers of the church by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.";
B._Act12_1="Now, about that time, Herod the king made cruel attacks on the Christians.";
B._Act12_2="And he put James, the brother of John, to death with the sword.";

B._Act12_5="So Peter was kept in prison: but the church made strong prayer to God for him.";
B._Act12_6="And when Herod was about to take him out, the same night Peter was sleeping in chains between two armed men, and the watchmen were keeping watch before the door of the prison.";
B._Act12_7="And a great light was seen shining in the room, and an angel of the Lord came to Peter and, touching him on his side so that he came out of his sleep, said, Get up quickly. And his chains came off his hands.";

B._Act12_13="And he gave a blow on the door, and a young girl came to it, named Rhoda.";
B._Act12_14="And hearing the voice of Peter, in her joy she went running, without opening the door, to say that Peter was outside.";
B._Act12_15="And they said to her, You are off your head. But still she said, with decision, that it was so. And they said, It is his angel.";
B._Act12_16="But Peter went on giving blows on the door: and when it was open and they saw him, they were full of wonder.";
B._Act12_17="But he made a sign to them with his hand to be quiet, and gave them an account of how the Lord had taken him out of prison. And he said, Give the news to James and the brothers. And then he went away.";
B._Act12_18="Now when it was day, the armed men were greatly troubled about what had become of Peter.";
B._Act12_19="And Herod, when he sent for him, and he was not there, after questioning the watchmen, gave orders that they were to be put to death. Then he went down from Judaea to Caesarea for a time.";
B._Act12_20="Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon: and they came to him, all together, and having made friends with Blastus, the controller of the king's house, they made a request for peace, because their country was dependent on the king's country for its food.";
B._Act12_21="And on the day which had been fixed, Herod, dressed in his robes and seated in his place, made a public statement to them.";
B._Act12_22="And the people, with loud cries, said, It is the voice of a god, not of a man.";
B._Act12_23="And straight away the angel of the Lord sent a disease on him, because he did not give the glory to God: and his flesh was wasted away by worms, and so he came to his end.";
B._Act12_24="But the word of the Lord went on increasing.";
B._Act12_25="And Barnabas and Saul came back from Jerusalem, when their work was ended, taking with them John named Mark.";
