B._Phl1_28="Having no fear of those who are against you; which is a clear sign of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God;";
B._Phl1_29="Because to you it has been given in the cause of Christ not only to have faith in him, but to undergo pain on his account:";
B._Phl1_30="Fighting the same fight which you saw in me, and now have word of in me.";
B._Phl2_1="If then there is any comfort in Christ, any help given by love, any uniting of hearts in the Spirit, any loving mercies and pity,";
B._Phl2_2="Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in harmony and of one mind;";
B._Phl2_3="Doing nothing through envy or through pride, but with low thoughts of self let everyone take others to be better than himself;";
B._Phl2_4="Not looking everyone to his private good, but keeping in mind the things of others.";
B._Phl2_5="Let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus,";
B._Phl2_6="To whom, though himself in the form of God, it did not seem that to take for oneself was to be like God;";
B._Phl2_7="But he made himself as nothing, taking the form of a servant, being made like men;";
B._Phl2_8="And being seen in form as a man, he took the lowest place, and let himself be put to death, even the death of the cross.";
B._Phl2_9="For this reason God has put him in the highest place and has given to him the name which is greater than every name;";
B._Phl2_10="So that at the name of Jesus every knee may be bent, of those in heaven and those on earth and those in the underworld,";
B._Phl2_11="And that every tongue may give witness that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.";
B._Phl2_12="So then, my loved ones, as you have at all times done what I say, not only when I am present, but now much more when I am not with you, give yourselves to working out your salvation with fear in your hearts;";
B._Phl2_13="For it is God who is the cause of your desires and of your acts, for his good pleasure.";
B._Phl2_14="Do all things without protests and arguments;";
B._Phl2_15="So that you may be holy and gentle, children of God without sin in a twisted and foolish generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world,";
B._Phl2_16="Offering the word of life; so that I may have glory in you in the day of Christ, because my running was not for nothing and my work was not without effect.";
B._Phl2_17="And even if I am offered like a drink offering, giving myself for the cause and work of your faith, I am glad and have joy with you all:";
B._Phl2_18="And in the same way do you be glad and have a part in my joy.";
B._Phl2_19="But I am hoping in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may be comforted when I have news of you.";
B._Phl2_20="For I have no man of like mind who will truly have care for you.";
B._Phl2_21="For they all go after what is theirs, not after the things of Christ.";
B._Phl2_22="But his quality is clear to you; how, as a child is to its father, so he was a help to me in the work of the good news.";
B._Phl2_23="Him then I am hoping to send as quickly as possible, when I am able to see how things will go for me:";
B._Phl2_24="But I have faith in the Lord that I myself will come before long.";
B._Phl2_25="But it seemed to me necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, who has taken part with me in the work and in the fight, and your servant, sent by you for help in my need;";
B._Phl2_26="Because his heart was with you all, and he was greatly troubled because you had news that he was ill:";
B._Phl2_27="For in fact he was ill almost to death: but God had mercy on him; and not only on him but on me, so that I might not have grief on grief.";
B._Phl2_28="I have sent him, then, the more gladly, so that when you see him again, you may be happy and I may have the less sorrow.";
B._Phl2_29="So take him to your hearts in the Lord with all joy, and give honour to such as he is:";
B._Phl2_30="Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, putting his life in danger to make your care for me complete.";
B._Phl3_1="For the rest, my brothers, be glad in the Lord. Writing the same things to you is no trouble to me, and for you it is safe.";
B._Phl3_2="Be on the watch against dogs, against the workers of evil, against those of the circumcision:";
B._Phl3_3="For we are the circumcision, who give worship to God and have glory in Jesus Christ, and have no faith in the flesh:";
B._Phl3_4="Even though I myself might have faith in the flesh: if any other man has reason to have faith in the flesh, I have more:";
B._Phl3_5="Being given circumcision on the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in relation to the law, a Pharisee:";
B._Phl3_6="In bitter hate I was cruel to the church; I kept all the righteousness of the law to the last detail.";
B._Phl3_7="But those things which were profit to me, I gave up for Christ.";
B._Phl3_8="Yes truly, and I am ready to give up all things for the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, which is more than all: for whom I have undergone the loss of all things, and to me they are less than nothing, so that I may have Christ as my reward,";
B._Phl3_9="And be seen in him, not having my righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:";
B._Phl3_10="That I may have knowledge of him, and of the power of his coming back from the dead, and a part with him in his pains, becoming like him in his death;";
B._Phl3_11="If in any way I may have the reward of life from the dead.";
B._Phl3_12="Not as if I had even now got the reward or been made complete: but I go on in the hope that I may come to the knowledge of that for which I was made the servant of Christ Jesus.";
B._Phl3_13="Brothers, it is clear to me that I have not come to that knowledge; but one thing I do, letting go those things which are past, and stretching out to the things which are before,";
B._Phl3_14="I go forward to the mark, even the reward of the high purpose of God in Christ Jesus.";
B._Phl3_15="Then let us all, who have come to full growth, be of this mind: and if in anything you are of a different mind, even this will God make clear to you:";
B._Phl3_16="Only, as far as we have got, let us be guided by the same rule.";
B._Phl3_17="Brothers, take me as your example, and take note of those who are walking after the example we have given.";
B._Phl3_18="For there are those, of whom I have given you word before, and do so now with sorrow, who are haters of the cross of Christ;";
B._Phl3_19="Whose end is destruction, whose god is the stomach, and whose glory is in their shame, whose minds are fixed on the things of the earth.";
B._Phl3_20="For our country is in heaven; from where the Saviour for whom we are waiting will come, even the Lord Jesus Christ:";
B._Phl3_21="By whom this poor body of ours will be changed into the image of the body of his glory, in the measure of the working by which he is able to put all things under himself.";
B._Phl4_1="So my brothers, well loved and very dear to me, my joy and crown, be strong in the Lord, my loved ones.";
B._Phl4_2="I make request to Euodias and Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.";
B._Phl4_3="And I make request to you, true helper in my work, to see to the needs of those women who took part with me in the good news, with Clement and the rest of my brother-workers whose names are in the book of life.";
B._Phl4_4="Be glad in the Lord at all times: again I say, Be glad.";
B._Phl4_5="Let your gentle behaviour be clear to all men. The Lord is near.";
B._Phl4_6="Have no cares; but in everything with prayer and praise put your requests before God.";
B._Phl4_7="And the peace of God, which is deeper than all knowledge, will keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.";
B._Phl4_8="For the rest, my brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things have honour, whatever things are upright, whatever things are holy, whatever things are beautiful, whatever things are of value, if there is any virtue and if there is any praise, give thought to these things.";
B._Phl4_9="The things which came to you by my teaching and preaching, and which you saw in me, these things do, and the God of peace will be with you.";
B._Phl4_10="But I am very glad in the Lord that your care for me has come to life again; though you did in fact take thought for me, but you were not able to give effect to it.";
B._Phl4_11="But I will not say anything about my needs, for I am able, wherever I am, to be dependent on myself.";
B._Phl4_12="It is the same to me if I am looked down on or honoured; everywhere and in all things I have the secret of how to be full and how to go without food; how to have wealth and how to be in need.";
B._Phl4_13="I am able to do all things through him who gives me strength.";
B._Phl4_14="But you did well to have care for me in my need.";
B._Phl4_15="And you have knowledge, Philippians, that when the good news first came to you, when I went away from Macedonia, no church took part with me in the business of giving to the saints, but you only;";
B._Phl4_16="Because even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to me in my need.";
B._Phl4_17="Not that I am looking for an offering, but for fruit which may be put to your credit.";
B._Phl4_18="I have all things and more than enough: I am made full, having had from Epaphroditus the things which came from you, a perfume of a sweet smell, an offering well pleasing to God.";
B._Phl4_19="And my God will give you all you have need of from the wealth of his glory in Christ Jesus.";
B._Phl4_20="Now to God our Father be glory for ever and ever. So be it.";
B._Phl4_21="Give words of love to every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send you their love.";
B._Phl4_22="All the saints send their love to you, specially those who are of Caesar's house.";
B._Phl4_23="The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.";
B._Col1_1="Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the purpose of God, and Timothy our brother,";
B._Col1_2="To the saints and true brothers in Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.";
B._Col1_3="We give praise to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, making prayer for you at all times,";
B._Col1_4="After hearing of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have for all the saints,";
B._Col1_5="Through the hope which is in store for you in heaven; knowledge of which was given to you before in the true word of the good news,";
B._Col1_6="Which has come to you; and which in all the world is giving fruit and increase, as it has done in you from the day when it came to your ears and you had true knowledge of the grace of God;";
B._Col1_7="As it was given to you by Epaphras, our well-loved helper, who is a true servant of Christ for us,";
B._Col1_8="And who, himself, made clear to us your love in the Spirit.";
B._Col1_9="For this reason, we, from the day when we had word of it, keep on in prayer for you, that you may be full of the knowledge of his purpose, with all wisdom and experience of the Spirit,";
B._Col1_10="Living uprightly in the approval of the Lord, giving fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;";
B._Col1_11="Full of strength in the measure of the great power of his glory, so that you may undergo all troubles with joy;";
B._Col1_12="Giving praise to the Father who has given us a part in the heritage of the saints in light;";
B._Col1_13="Who has made us free from the power of evil and given us a place in the kingdom of the Son of his love;";
B._Col1_14="In whom we have our salvation, the forgiveness of sins:";
B._Col1_15="Who is the image of the unseen God coming into existence before all living things;";
B._Col1_16="For by him all things were made, in heaven and on earth, things seen and things unseen, authorities, lords, rulers, and powers; all things were made by him and for him;";
B._Col1_17="He is before all things, and in him all things have being.";
B._Col1_18="And he is the head of the body, the church: the starting point of all things, the first to come again from the dead; so that in all things he might have the chief place.";
B._Col1_19="For God in full measure was pleased to be in him;";
B._Col1_20="Through him uniting all things with himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross; through him, I say, uniting all things which are on earth or in heaven.";
B._Col1_21="And you, who in the past were cut off and at war with God in your minds through evil works, he has now made one";
B._Col1_22="In the body of his flesh through death, so that you might be holy and without sin and free from all evil before him:";
B._Col1_23="If you keep yourselves safely based in the faith, not moved from the hope of the good news which came to you, and which was given to every living being under heaven; of which I, Paul, was made a servant.";
B._Col1_24="Now I have joy in my pain because of you, and in my flesh I undergo whatever is still needed to make the sorrows of Christ complete, for the salvation of his body, the church;";
B._Col1_25="Of which I became a servant by the purpose of God which was given to me for you, to give effect to the word of God,";
B._Col1_26="The secret which has been kept from all times and generations, but has now been made clear to his saints,";
B._Col1_27="To whom God was pleased to give knowledge of the wealth of the glory of this secret among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:";
B._Col1_28="Whom we are preaching; guiding and teaching every man in all wisdom, so that every man may be complete in Christ;";
B._Col1_29="And for this purpose I am working, using all my strength by the help of his power which is working in me strongly.";
B._Col2_1="For it is my desire to give you news of the great fight I am making for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not seen my face in the flesh;";
B._Col2_2="So that their hearts may be comforted, and that being joined together in love, they may come to the full wealth of the certain knowledge of the secret of God, even Christ,";
B._Col2_3="In whom are all the secret stores of wisdom and knowledge.";
B._Col2_4="I say this so that you may not be turned away by any deceit of words.";
B._Col2_5="For though I am not present in the flesh, still I am with you in the spirit, seeing with joy your order, and your unchanging faith in Christ.";
B._Col2_6="As, then, you took Christ Jesus the Lord, so go on in him,";
B._Col2_7="Rooted and based together in him, strong in the faith which the teaching gave you, giving praise to God at all times.";
B._Col2_8="Take care that no one takes you away by force, through man's wisdom and deceit, going after the beliefs of men and the theories of the world, and not after Christ:";
B._Col2_9="For in him all the wealth of God's being has a living form,";
B._Col2_10="And you are complete in him, who is the head of all rule and authority:";
B._Col2_11="In whom you had a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;";
B._Col2_12="Having been put to death with him in baptism, by which you came to life again with him, through faith in the working of God, who made him come back from the dead.";
B._Col2_13="And you, being dead through your sins and the evil condition of your flesh, to you, I say, he gave life together with him, and forgiveness of all our sins;";
B._Col2_14="Having put an end to the handwriting of the law which was against us, taking it out of the way by nailing it to his cross;";
B._Col2_15="Having made himself free from the rule of authorities and powers, he put them openly to shame, glorying over them in it.";
B._Col2_16="For this reason let no man be your judge in any question of food or drink or feast days or new moons or Sabbaths:";
B._Col2_17="For these are an image of the things which are to come; but the body is Christ's.";
B._Col2_18="Let no man take your reward from you by consciously making little of himself and giving worship to angels; having his thoughts fixed on the things which he has seen, being foolishly lifted up in his natural mind,";
B._Col2_19="And not joined to the Head, from whom all the body, being given strength and kept together through its joins and bands, has its growth with the increase of God.";
B._Col2_20="If you were made free, by your death with Christ, from the rules of the world, why do you put yourselves under the authority of orders";
B._Col2_21="Which say there may be no touching, tasting, or taking in your hands,";
B._Col2_22="(Rules which are all to come to an end with their use) after the orders and teaching of men?";
B._Col2_23="These things seem to have a sort of wisdom in self-ordered worship and making little of oneself, and being cruel to the body, not honouring it by giving it its natural use.";
B._Col3_1="If then you have a new life with Christ, give your attention to the things of heaven, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.";
B._Col3_2="Keep your mind on the higher things, not on the things of earth.";
B._Col3_3="For your life on earth is done, and you have a secret life with Christ in God.";
B._Col3_4="At the coming of Christ who is our life, you will be seen with him in glory.";
B._Col3_5="Then put to death your bodies which are of the earth; wrong use of the flesh, unclean things, passion, evil desires and envy, which is the worship of strange gods;";
B._Col3_6="Because of which the wrath of God comes on those who go against his orders;";
B._Col3_7="Among whom you were living in the past, when you did such things.";
B._Col3_8="But now it is right for you to put away all these things; wrath, passion, bad feeling, curses, unclean talk;";
B._Col3_9="Do not make false statements to one another; because you have put away the old man with all his doings,";
B._Col3_10="And have put on the new man, which has become new in knowledge after the image of his maker;";
B._Col3_11="Where there is no Greek or Jew, no one with circumcision or without circumcision, no division between nations, no servant or free man: but Christ is all and in all.";
B._Col3_12="As saints of God, then, holy and dearly loved, let your behaviour be marked by pity and mercy, kind feeling, a low opinion of yourselves, gentle ways, and a power of undergoing all things;";
B._Col3_13="Being gentle to one another and having forgiveness for one another, if anyone has done wrong to his brother, even as the Lord had forgiveness for you:";
B._Col3_14="And more than all, have love; the only way in which you may be completely joined together.";
B._Col3_15="And let the peace of Christ be ruling in your hearts, as it was the purpose of God for you to be one body; and give praise to God at all times.";
B._Col3_16="Let the word of Christ be in you in all wealth of wisdom; teaching and helping one another with songs of praise and holy words, making melody to God with grace in your hearts.";
B._Col3_17="And whatever you do, in word or in act, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving praise to God the Father through him.";
B._Col3_18="Wives, be under the authority of your husbands, as is right in the Lord.";
B._Col3_19="Husbands, have love for your wives, and be not bitter against them.";
B._Col3_20="Children, do the orders of your fathers and mothers in all things, for this is pleasing to the Lord.";
B._Col3_21="Fathers, do not be hard on your children, so that their spirit may not be broken.";
B._Col3_22="Servants, in all things do the orders of your natural masters; not only when their eyes are on you, as pleasers of men, but with all your heart, fearing the Lord:";
B._Col3_23="Whatever you do, do it readily, as to the Lord and not to men;";
B._Col3_24="Being certain that the Lord will give you the reward of the heritage: for you are the servants of the Lord Christ.";
B._Col3_25="For the wrongdoer will have punishment for the wrong he has done, without respect for any man's position.";
B._Col4_1="Masters, give your servants what is right and equal, conscious that you have a Master in heaven.";
B._Col4_2="Give yourselves to prayer at all times, keeping watch with praise;";
B._Col4_3="And making prayer for us, that God may give us an open door for the preaching of the word, the secret of Christ, for which I am now in chains;";
B._Col4_4="So that I may make it clear, as it is right for me to do.";

B._Col4_8="And I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may have news of how we are, and so that he may give your hearts comfort;";
B._Col4_9="And with him I have sent Onesimus, the true and well-loved brother, who is one of you. They will give you word of everything which is taking place here.";
B._Col4_10="Aristarchus, my brother-prisoner, sends his love to you, and Mark, a relation of Barnabas (about whom you have been given orders: if he comes to you, be kind to him),";
B._Col4_11="And Jesus, whose other name is Justus; these are of the circumcision: they are my only brother-workers for the kingdom of God, who have been a comfort to me.";
B._Col4_12="Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, sends you his love, ever taking thought for you in his prayers, that you may be complete and fully certain of all the purpose of God.";
B._Col4_13="For I give witness of him that he has undergone much trouble for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis.";
B._Col4_14="Luke, our well-loved medical friend, and Demas, send you their love.";
B._Col4_15="Give my love to the brothers in Laodicea and to Nymphas and the church in their house.";
B._Col4_16="And when this letter has been made public among you, let the same be done in the church of Laodicea; and see that you have the letter from Laodicea.";
B._Col4_17="Say to Archippus, See that you do the work which the Lord has given you to do.";
B._Col4_18="I, Paul, give you this word of love in my handwriting. Keep in memory that I am a prisoner. Grace be with you.";
B._1Ts1_1="Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.";
B._1Ts1_2="We give praise to God at all times for you, keeping you in memory in our prayers;";
B._1Ts1_3="Having ever in mind your work of faith and acts of love and the strength of your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father;";
B._1Ts1_4="Being conscious, my brothers, dear to God, that you have been marked out by God's purpose;";
B._1Ts1_5="Because our good news came to you, not in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Spirit, so that you were completely certain of it; even as you saw what our behaviour to you was like from our love to you.";
B._1Ts1_6="And you took us and the Lord as your example, after the word had come to you in much trouble, with joy in the Holy Spirit;";
B._1Ts1_7="So that you became an example to all those who have faith in Christ in Macedonia and Achaia.";
B._1Ts1_8="For not only was the word of the Lord sounding out from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith in God is made clear; so that we have no need to say anything.";
B._1Ts1_9="For they themselves give the news of how we came among you; and how you were turned from images to God, to the worship of a true and living God,";
B._1Ts1_10="Waiting for his Son from heaven, who came back from the dead, even Jesus, our Saviour from the wrath to come.";
B._1Ts2_1="For you yourselves, brothers, are conscious that our coming among you was not without effect:";
B._1Ts2_2="But after we had first undergone much pain and been cruelly attacked as you saw, at Philippi, by the help of God we gave you the good news without fear, though everything was against us.";
B._1Ts2_3="For our witness does not come from error or from an unclean heart or from deceit:";
B._1Ts2_4="But even as the good news was given to us by the approval of God, so we give it out; not as pleasing men, but God by whom our hearts are tested.";
B._1Ts2_5="For it is common knowledge among you that we never made use of smooth-sounding false words, and God is witness that at no time were we secretly desiring profit for ourselves,";
B._1Ts2_6="Or looking for glory from men, from you or from others, when we might have made ourselves a care to you as Apostles of Christ.";
B._1Ts2_7="But we were gentle among you, like a woman caring for her little ones:";
B._1Ts2_8="Even so, being full of loving desire for you, we took delight in giving you not only God's good news, but even our lives, because you were dear to us.";
B._1Ts2_9="For you have the memory, my brothers, of our trouble and care; how, working night and day, so that we might not be a trouble to any of you, we gave you the good news of God.";
B._1Ts2_10="You are witnesses, with God, how holy and upright and free from all evil was our way of life among you who have faith;";
