B._Rom7_13="Was then that which is good, death to me? In no way. But the purpose was that sin might be seen to be sin by working death to me through that which is good; so that through the orders of the law sin might seem much more evil.";
B._Rom7_14="For we are conscious that the law is of the spirit; but I am of the flesh, given into the power of sin.";
B._Rom7_15="And I have no clear knowledge of what I am doing, for that which I have a mind to do, I do not, but what I have hate for, that I do.";
B._Rom7_16="But, if I do that which I have no mind to do, I am in agreement with the law that the law is good.";
B._Rom7_17="So it is no longer I who do it, but the sin living in me.";
B._Rom7_18="For I am conscious that in me, that is, in my flesh, there is nothing good: I have the mind but not the power to do what is right.";
B._Rom7_19="For the good which I have a mind to do, I do not: but the evil which I have no mind to do, that I do.";
B._Rom7_20="But if I do what I have no mind to do, it is no longer I who do it, but the sin living in me.";
B._Rom7_21="So I see a law that, though I have a mind to do good, evil is present in me.";
B._Rom7_22="In my heart I take pleasure in the law of God,";
B._Rom7_23="But I see another law in my body, working against the law of my mind, and making me the servant of the law of sin which is in my flesh.";
B._Rom7_24="How unhappy am I! who will make me free from the body of this death?";
B._Rom7_25="I give praise to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So with my mind I am a servant to the law of God, but with my flesh to the law of sin.";
B._Rom8_1="For this cause those who are in Christ Jesus will not be judged as sinners.";
B._Rom8_2="For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.";
B._Rom8_3="For what the law was not able to do because it was feeble through the flesh, God, sending his Son in the image of the evil flesh, and as an offering for sin, gave his decision against sin in the flesh:";
B._Rom8_4="So that what was ordered by the law might be done in us, who are living, not in the way of the flesh, but in the way of the Spirit.";
B._Rom8_5="For those who are living in the way of the flesh give their minds to the things of the flesh, but those who go in the way of the Spirit, to the things of the Spirit.";
B._Rom8_6="For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace:";
B._Rom8_7="Because the mind of the flesh is opposite to God; it is not under the law of God, and is not able to be:";
B._Rom8_8="So that those who are in the flesh are not able to give pleasure to God.";
B._Rom8_9="You are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God is in you. But if any man has not the Spirit of Christ he is not one of his.";
B._Rom8_10="And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.";
B._Rom8_11="But if the Spirit of him who made Jesus come again from the dead is in you, he who made Christ Jesus come again from the dead will in the same way, through his Spirit which is in you, give life to your bodies which now are under the power of death.";
B._Rom8_12="So then, my brothers, we are in debt, not to the flesh to be living in the way of the flesh:";
B._Rom8_13="For if you go in the way of the flesh, death will come on you; but if by the Spirit you put to death the works of the body, you will have life.";
B._Rom8_14="And all those who are guided by the Spirit of God are sons of God.";
B._Rom8_15="For you did not get the spirit of servants again to put you in fear, but the spirit of sons was given to you, by which we say, Abba, Father.";
B._Rom8_16="The Spirit is witness with our spirit that we are children of God:";
B._Rom8_17="And if we are children, we have a right to a part in the heritage; a part in the things of God, together with Christ; so that if we have a part in his pain, we will in the same way have a part in his glory.";
B._Rom8_18="I am of the opinion that there is no comparison between the pain of this present time and the glory which we will see in the future.";
B._Rom8_19="For the strong desire of every living thing is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God.";
B._Rom8_20="For every living thing was put under the power of change, not by its desire, but by him who made it so, in hope";
B._Rom8_21="That all living things will be made free from the power of death and will have a part with the free children of God in glory.";
B._Rom8_22="For we are conscious that all living things are weeping and sorrowing in pain together till now.";
B._Rom8_23="And not only so, but we who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we have sorrow in our minds, waiting for the time when we will take our place as sons, that is, the salvation of our bodies.";
B._Rom8_24="For our salvation is by hope: but hope which is seen is not hope: for who is hoping for what he sees?";
B._Rom8_25="But if we have hope for that which we see not, then we will be able to go on waiting for it.";
B._Rom8_26="And in the same way the Spirit is a help to our feeble hearts: for we are not able to make prayer to God in the right way; but the Spirit puts our desires into words which are not in our power to say;";
B._Rom8_27="And he who is the searcher of hearts has knowledge of the mind of the Spirit, because he is making prayers for the saints in agreement with the mind of God.";
B._Rom8_28="And we are conscious that all things are working together for good to those who have love for God, and have been marked out by his purpose.";
B._Rom8_29="Because those of whom he had knowledge before they came into existence, were marked out by him to be made like his Son, so that he might be the first among a band of brothers:";
B._Rom8_30="And those who were marked out by him were named; and those who were named were given righteousness; and to those to whom he gave righteousness, in the same way he gave glory.";
B._Rom8_31="What may we say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us?";
B._Rom8_32="He who did not keep back his only Son, but gave him up for us all, will he not with him freely give us all things?";
B._Rom8_33="Who will say anything against the saints of God? It is God who makes us clear from evil;";
B._Rom8_34="Who will give a decision against us? It is Christ Jesus who not only was put to death, but came again from the dead, who is now at the right hand of God, taking our part.";
B._Rom8_35="Who will come between us and the love of Christ? Will trouble, or pain, or cruel acts, or the need of food or of clothing, or danger, or the sword?";
B._Rom8_36="As it is said in the holy Writings, Because of you we are put to death every day; we are like sheep ready for destruction.";
B._Rom8_37="But we are able to overcome all these things and more through his love.";
B._Rom8_38="For I am certain that not death, or life, or angels, or rulers, or things present, or things to come, or powers,";
B._Rom8_39="Or things on high, or things under the earth, or anything which is made, will be able to come between us and the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.";
B._Rom9_1="I say what is true in Christ, and not what is false, my mind giving witness with me in the Holy Spirit,";
B._Rom9_2="That I am full of sorrow and pain without end.";
B._Rom9_3="For I have a desire to take on myself the curse for my brothers, my family in the flesh:";
B._Rom9_4="Who are Israelites: who have the place of sons, and the glory, and the agreements with God, and the giving of the law, and the worship, and the hope offered by God:";
B._Rom9_5="Whose are the fathers, and of whom came Christ in the flesh, who is over all, God, to whom be blessing for ever. So be it.";
B._Rom9_6="But it is not as if the word of God was without effect. For they are not all Israel, who are of Israel:";
B._Rom9_7="And they are not all children because they are the seed of Abraham; but, In Isaac will your seed be named.";
B._Rom9_8="That is, it is not the children of the flesh, but the children of God's undertaking, who are named as the seed.";
B._Rom9_9="For this is the word of God's undertaking, At this time will I come, and Sarah will have a son.";
B._Rom9_10="And not only so, but Rebecca being about to have a child by our father Isaac--";
B._Rom9_11="Before the children had come into existence, or had done anything good or bad, in order that God's purpose and his selection might be effected, not by works, but by him whose purpose it is,";
B._Rom9_12="It was said to her, The older will be the servant of the younger.";
B._Rom9_13="Even as it is said, I had love for Jacob, but for Esau I had hate.";
B._Rom9_14="What may we say then? is God not upright? let it not be said.";
B._Rom9_15="For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and pity on whom I will have pity.";
B._Rom9_16="So then, it is not by the desire or by the attempt of man, but by the mercy of God.";
B._Rom9_17="For the holy Writings say to Pharaoh, For this same purpose did I put you on high, so that I might make my power seen in you, and that there might be knowledge of my name through all the earth.";
B._Rom9_18="So then, at his pleasure he has mercy on a man, and at his pleasure he makes the heart hard.";
B._Rom9_19="But you will say to me, Why does he still make us responsible? who is able to go against his purpose?";
B._Rom9_20="But, O man, who are you, to make answer against God? May the thing which is made say to him who made it, Why did you make me so?";
B._Rom9_21="Or has not the potter the right to make out of one part of his earth a vessel for honour, and out of another a vessel for shame?";
B._Rom9_22="What if God, desiring to let his wrath and his power be seen, for a long time put up with the vessels of wrath which were ready for destruction:";
B._Rom9_23="And to make clear the wealth of his glory to vessels of mercy, which he had before made ready for glory,";
B._Rom9_24="Even us, who were marked out by him, not only from the Jews, but from the Gentiles?";
B._Rom9_25="As he says in Hosea, They will be named my people who were not my people, and she will be loved who was not loved.";
B._Rom9_26="And in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, there they will be named the sons of the living God.";
B._Rom9_27="And Isaiah says about Israel, Even if the number of the children of Israel is as the sand of the sea, only a small part will get salvation:";
B._Rom9_28="For the Lord will give effect to his word on the earth, putting an end to it and cutting it short.";
B._Rom9_29="And, as Isaiah had said before, If the Lord of armies had not given us a seed, we would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah.";
B._Rom9_30="What then may we say? That the nations who did not go after righteousness have got righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith:";
B._Rom9_31="But Israel, going after a law of righteousness, did not get it.";
B._Rom9_32="Why? Because they were not searching for it by faith, but by works. They came up against the stone which was in the way;";
B._Rom9_33="As it is said, See, I am putting in Zion a stone causing a fall, and a rock in the way: but he who has faith in him will not be put to shame.";
B._Rom10_1="Brothers, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is, that they may get salvation.";
B._Rom10_2="For I give witness of them that they have a strong desire for God, but not with knowledge.";
B._Rom10_3="Because, not having knowledge of God's righteousness, and desiring to give effect to their righteousness, they have not put themselves under the righteousness of God.";
B._Rom10_4="For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who has faith.";
B._Rom10_5="For Moses says that the man who does the righteousness which is of the law will get life by it.";
B._Rom10_6="But the righteousness which is of faith says these words, Say not in your heart, Who will go up to heaven? (that is, to make Christ come down:)";
B._Rom10_7="Or, Who will go down into the deep? (that is, to make Christ come again from the dead:)";
B._Rom10_8="But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart: that is, the word of faith of which we are the preachers:";
B._Rom10_9="Because, if you say with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and have faith in your heart that God has made him come back from the dead, you will have salvation:";
B._Rom10_10="For with the heart man has faith to get righteousness, and with the mouth he says that Jesus is Lord to get salvation.";
B._Rom10_11="Because it is said in the holy Writings, Whoever has faith in him will not be shamed.";
B._Rom10_12="And the Jew is not different from the Greek: for there is the same Lord of all, who is good to all who have hope in his name:";
B._Rom10_13="Because, Whoever will give worship to the name of the Lord will get salvation.";
B._Rom10_14="But how will they give worship to him in whom they have no faith? and how will they have faith in him of whom they have not had news? and how will they have news without a preacher?";
B._Rom10_15="And how will there be preachers if they are not sent? As it is said, How beautiful are the feet of those who give the glad news of good things.";
B._Rom10_16="But they have not all given ear to the good news. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has had faith in our word?";
B._Rom10_17="So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.";
B._Rom10_18="But I say, Did not the word come to their ears? Yes, certainly: Their sound has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.";
B._Rom10_19="But I say, Had Israel no knowledge? First Moses says, You will be moved to envy by that which is not a nation, and by a foolish people I will make you angry.";
B._Rom10_20="And Isaiah says without fear, Those who were not searching for me made discovery of me; and I was seen by those whose hearts were turned away from me.";
B._Rom10_21="But about Israel he says; All the day my hands have been stretched out to a people whose hearts were turned away, and who put themselves against my word.";
B._Rom11_1="So I say, Has God put his people on one side? Let there be no such thought. For I am of Israel, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.";
B._Rom11_2="God has not put away the people of his selection. Or have you no knowledge of what is said about Elijah in the holy Writings? how he says words to God against Israel,";
B._Rom11_3="Lord, they have put your prophets to death, and made waste your altars, and now I am the last, and they are searching for me to take away my life.";
B._Rom11_4="But what answer does God make to him? I have still seven thousand men whose knees have not been bent to Baal.";
B._Rom11_5="In the same way, there are at this present time some who are marked out by the selection of grace.";
B._Rom11_6="But if it is of grace, then it is no longer of works: or grace would not be grace.";
B._Rom11_7="What then? That which Israel was searching for he did not get, but those of the selection got it and the rest were made hard.";
B._Rom11_8="As it was said in the holy Writings, God gave them a spirit of sleep, eyes which might not see, and ears which have no hearing, to this day.";
B._Rom11_9="And David says, Let their table be made a net for taking them, and a stone in their way, and a punishment:";
B._Rom11_10="Let their eyes be made dark so that they may not see, and let their back be bent down at all times.";
B._Rom11_11="So I say, Were their steps made hard in order that they might have a fall? In no way: but by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, so that they might be moved to envy.";
B._Rom11_12="Now, if their fall is the wealth of the world, and their loss the wealth of the Gentiles, how much greater will be the glory when they are made full?";
B._Rom11_13="But I say to you, Gentiles, in so far as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles, I make much of my position:";
B._Rom11_14="If in any way those who are of my flesh may be moved to envy, so that some of them may get salvation by me.";
B._Rom11_15="For, if by their putting away, the rest of men have been made friends with God, what will their coming back again be, but life from the dead?";
B._Rom11_16="And if the first-fruit is holy, so is the mass: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.";
B._Rom11_17="But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, an olive-tree of the fields, were put in among them, and were given a part with them in the root by which the olive-tree is made fertile,";
B._Rom11_18="Do not be uplifted in pride over the branches: because it is not you who are the support of the root, but it is by the root that you are supported.";
B._Rom11_19="You will say, Branches were broken off so that I might be put in.";
B._Rom11_20="Truly, because they had no faith they were broken off, and you have your place by reason of your faith. Do not be lifted up in pride, but have fear;";
B._Rom11_21="For, if God did not have mercy on the natural branches, he will not have mercy on you.";
B._Rom11_22="See then that God is good but his rules are fixed: to those who were put away he was hard, but to you he has been good, on the condition that you keep in his mercy; if not, you will be cut off as they were.";
B._Rom11_23="And they, if they do not go on without faith, will be united to the tree again, because God is able to put them in again.";
B._Rom11_24="For if you were cut out of a field olive-tree, and against the natural use were united to a good olive-tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be united again with the olive-tree which was theirs?";
B._Rom11_25="For it is my desire, brothers, that this secret may be clear to you, so that you may not have pride in your knowledge, that Israel has been made hard in part, till all the Gentiles have come in;";
B._Rom11_26="And so all Israel will get salvation: as it is said in the holy Writings, There will come out of Zion the One who makes free; by him wrongdoing will be taken away from Jacob:";
B._Rom11_27="And this is my agreement with them, when I will take away their sins.";
B._Rom11_28="As far as the good news is in question, they are cut off from God on account of you, but as far as the selection is in question, they are loved on account of the fathers.";
B._Rom11_29="Because God's selection and his mercies may not be changed.";
B._Rom11_30="For as you, in time past, were not under the rule of God, but now have got mercy through their turning away,";
B._Rom11_31="So in the same way these have gone against the orders of God, so that by the mercy given to you they may now get mercy.";
B._Rom11_32="For God has let them all go against his orders, so that he might have mercy on them all.";
B._Rom11_33="O how deep is the wealth of the wisdom and knowledge of God! no one is able to make discovery of his decisions, and his ways may not be searched out.";
B._Rom11_34="Who has knowledge of the mind of the Lord? or who has taken part in his purposes?";
B._Rom11_35="Or who has first given to him, and it will be given back to him again?";
B._Rom11_36="For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever. So be it.";
B._Rom12_1="For this reason I make request to you, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you will give your bodies as a living offering, holy, pleasing to God, which is the worship it is right for you to give him.";
B._Rom12_2="And let not your behaviour be like that of this world, but be changed and made new in mind, so that by experience you may have knowledge of the good and pleasing and complete purpose of God.";
B._Rom12_3="But I say to every one of you, through the grace given to me, not to have an over-high opinion of himself, but to have wise thoughts, as God has given to every one a measure of faith.";
B._Rom12_4="For, as we have a number of parts in one body, but all the parts have not the same use,";
B._Rom12_5="So we, though we are a number of persons, are one body in Christ, and are dependent on one another;";
B._Rom12_6="And having different qualities by reason of the grace given to us, such as the quality of a prophet, let it be made use of in relation to the measure of our faith;";
B._Rom12_7="Or the position of a Deacon of the church, let a man give himself to it; or he who has the power of teaching, let him make use of it;";
B._Rom12_8="He who has the power of comforting, let him do so; he who gives, let him give freely; he who has the power of ruling, let him do it with a serious mind; he who has mercy on others, let it be with joy.";
B._Rom12_9="Let love be without deceit. Be haters of what is evil; keep your minds fixed on what is good.";
B._Rom12_10="Be kind to one another with a brother's love, putting others before yourselves in honour;";
B._Rom12_11="Be not slow in your work, but be quick in spirit, as the Lord's servants;";
B._Rom12_12="Being glad in hope, quiet in trouble, at all times given to prayer,";
B._Rom12_13="Giving to the needs of the saints, ready to take people into your houses.";
B._Rom12_14="Give blessing and not curses to those who are cruel to you.";
B._Rom12_15="Take part in the joy of those who are glad, and in the grief of those who are sorrowing.";
B._Rom12_16="Be in harmony with one another. Do not have a high opinion of yourselves, but be in agreement with common people. Do not give yourselves an air of wisdom.";
B._Rom12_17="Do not give evil for evil to any man. Let all your business be well ordered in the eyes of all men.";
B._Rom12_18="As far as it is possible for you be at peace with all men.";
B._Rom12_19="Do not give punishment for wrongs done to you, dear brothers, but give way to the wrath of God; for it is said in the holy Writings, Punishment is mine, I will give reward, says the Lord.";
B._Rom12_20="But if one who has hate for you is in need of food or of drink, give it to him, for in so doing you will put coals of fire on his head.";
B._Rom12_21="Do not let evil overcome you, but overcome evil by good.";
B._Rom13_1="Let everyone put himself under the authority of the higher powers, because there is no power which is not of God, and all powers are ordered by God.";
B._Rom13_2="For which reason everyone who puts himself against the authority puts himself against the order of God: and those who are against it will get punishment for themselves.";
B._Rom13_3="For rulers are not a cause of fear to the good work but to the evil. If you would have no fear of the authority, do good and you will have praise;";
B._Rom13_4="For he is the servant of God to you for good. But if you do evil, have fear; for the sword is not in his hand for nothing: he is God's servant, making God's punishment come on the evil-doer.";
B._Rom13_5="So put yourselves under the authority, not for fear of wrath, but because you have the knowledge of what is right.";
B._Rom13_6="For the same reason, make payment of taxes; because the authority is God's servant, to take care of such things at all times.";
B._Rom13_7="Give to all what is their right: taxes to him whose they are, payment to him whose right it is, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour is to be given.";
B._Rom13_8="Be in debt for nothing, but to have love for one another: for he who has love for his neighbour has kept all the law.";
B._Rom13_9="And this, Do not be untrue in married life, Do not put to death, Do not take what is another's, Do not have desire for what is another's, and if there is any other order, it is covered by this word, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself.";
B._Rom13_10="Love does no wrong to his neighbour, so love makes the law complete.";
B._Rom13_11="See then that the time has come for you to be awake from sleep: for now is your salvation nearer than when you first had faith.";
B._Rom13_12="The night is far gone, and the day is near: so let us put off the works of the dark, arming ourselves with light,";
B._Rom13_13="With right behaviour as in the day; not in pleasure-making and drinking, not in bad company and unclean behaviour, not in fighting and envy.";
B._Rom13_14="But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not give thought to the flesh to do its desires.";
B._Rom14_1="Do not put on one side him who is feeble in faith, and do not put him in doubt by your reasonings.";
B._Rom14_2="One man has faith to take all things as food: another who is feeble in faith takes only green food.";
B._Rom14_3="Let not him who takes food have a low opinion of him who does not: and let not him who does not take food be a judge of him who does; for he has God's approval.";
B._Rom14_4="Who are you to make yourself a judge of another man's servant? it is to his master that he is responsible for good or bad. Yes, his place will be safe, because the Lord is able to keep him from falling.";
B._Rom14_5="This man puts one day before another: to that man they are the same. Let every man be certain in his mind.";
B._Rom14_6="He who keeps the day, keeps it to the Lord; and he who takes food, takes it as to the Lord, for he gives praise to God; and he who does not take food, to the Lord he takes it not, and gives praise to God.";
B._Rom14_7="For every man's life and every man's death has a relation to others as well as to himself.";
