B._Act19_5="And hearing this, they had baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus.";
B._Act19_6="And when Paul had put his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they had the power of talking in tongues, and acting like prophets.";
B._Act19_7="And there were about twelve of these men.";
B._Act19_8="And he went into the Synagogue, and for three months he was preaching there without fear, reasoning and teaching about the kingdom of God.";
B._Act19_9="But because some of the people were hard-hearted and would not give hearing, saying evil words about the Way before the people, he went away from them, and kept the disciples separate, reasoning every day in the school of Tyrannus.";
B._Act19_10="And this went on for two years, so that all those who were living in Asia had knowledge of the word of the Lord, Greeks as well as Jews.";
B._Act19_11="And God did special works of power by the hands of Paul:";
B._Act19_12="So that bits of linen and clothing from his body were taken to people who were ill, and their diseases went away from them and the evil spirits went out.";
B._Act19_13="But some of the Jews who went from place to place driving out evil spirits, took it on themselves to make use of the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, I give you orders, by Jesus, whom Paul is preaching.";
B._Act19_14="And there were seven sons of a man named Sceva, a Jew and a chief priest, who did this.";
B._Act19_15="And the evil spirit, answering, said to them, I have knowledge of Jesus, and of Paul, but who are you?";
B._Act19_16="And the man in whom the evil spirit was, jumping on them, was stronger than the two of them, and overcame them, so that they went running from that house, wounded and without their clothing.";
B._Act19_17="And this came to the ears of all those, Jews and Greeks, who were living at Ephesus; and fear came on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was made great.";
B._Act19_18="And a number of those who had faith came and made a public statement of their sins and all their acts.";
B._Act19_19="And a great number of those who were experts in strange arts took their books and put them on the fire in front of everyone: and when the books were valued they came to fifty thousand bits of silver.";
B._Act19_20="So the word of the Lord was increased very greatly and was full of power.";
B._Act19_21="Now after these things were ended, Paul came to a decision that when he had gone through Macedonia and Achaia he would go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I have a desire to see Rome.";
B._Act19_22="And having sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia, he himself went on living in Asia for a time.";
B._Act19_23="And about that time a great outcry took place about the Way.";
B._Act19_24="For there was a certain man named Demetrius, a silver-worker, who made silver boxes for the images of Diana, and gave no small profit to the workmen;";
B._Act19_25="Whom he got together, with other workmen of the same trade, and said to them, Men, it is clear that from this business we get our wealth.";
B._Act19_26="And you see, for it has come to your ears, that not only at Ephesus, but almost all through Asia, this Paul has been teaching numbers of people and turning them away, saying that those are not gods who are made by men's hands:";
B._Act19_27="And there is danger, not only that our trade may be damaged in the opinion of men, but that the holy place of the great goddess Diana may be no longer honoured, and that she to whom all Asia and the world give worship, will be put down from her high position.";
B._Act19_28="And hearing this, they were very angry, crying out and saying, Great is Diana of Ephesus.";

B._Act19_30="And when Paul was about to go in to the people, the disciples did not let him.";
B._Act19_31="And some of the rulers of Asia, being his friends, sent to him, requesting him seriously not to put himself in danger by going into the theatre.";
B._Act19_32="And some said one thing, and some another: for there was no order in the meeting; and most of them had no idea why they had come together.";
B._Act19_33="Then they took Alexander out from among the people, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander, making a sign with his hand, was about to make a statement to the people in answer:";
B._Act19_34="But when they saw that he was a Jew, all of them with one voice went on crying out for about two hours, Great is Diana of Ephesus.";
B._Act19_35="And when the chief secretary had got the people quiet, he said, Men of Ephesus, is any man without knowledge that the town of Ephesus is the keeper of the holy place of the great Diana, who was sent down from Jupiter?";
B._Act19_36="So then, because these things may not be doubted, it would be better for you to be quiet, and do nothing unwise.";
B._Act19_37="For you have taken these men, who are not doing damage to the holy place or talking against our goddess.";
B._Act19_38="If, then, Demetrius and the workmen who are with him have a protest to make against any man, the law is open to them, and there are judges; let them put up a cause at law against one another.";
B._Act19_39="But if any other business is in question, let it be taken up in the regular meeting.";
B._Act19_40="For, truly, we are in danger of being made responsible for this day's trouble, there being no cause for it: and we are not able to give any reason for this coming together.";

B._Act20_3="And when he had been there three months, because the Jews had made a secret design against him when he was about to take ship for Syria, he made a decision to go back through Macedonia.";
B._Act20_4="And Sopater of Beroea, the son of Pyrrhus, and Aristarchus and Secundus of Thessalonica, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia, went with him as far as Asia.";
B._Act20_5="But these had gone before, and were waiting for us at Troas.";
B._Act20_6="And we went away from Philippi by ship after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days; and we were there for seven days.";
B._Act20_7="And on the first day of the week, when we had come together for the holy meal, Paul gave them a talk, for it was his purpose to go away on the day after; and he went on talking till after the middle of the night.";
B._Act20_8="And there were a number of lights in the room where we had come together.";
B._Act20_9="And a certain young man named Eutychus, who was seated in the window, went into a deep sleep; and while Paul went on talking, being overcome by sleep, he had a fall from the third floor, and was taken up dead.";

B._Act20_16="For Paul's purpose was to go past Ephesus, so that he might not be kept in Asia; for he was going quickly, in order, if possible, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.";
B._Act20_17="And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the rulers of the church.";
B._Act20_18="And when they had come, he said to them, You yourselves have seen what my life has been like all the time from the day when I first came into Asia,";
B._Act20_19="Doing the Lord's work without pride, through all the sorrow and troubles which came on me because of the evil designs of the Jews:";
B._Act20_20="And how I kept back nothing which might be of profit to you, teaching you publicly and privately,";
B._Act20_21="Preaching to Jews and to Greeks the need for a turning of the heart to God, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.";
B._Act20_22="And now, as you see, I am going to Jerusalem, a prisoner in spirit, having no knowledge of what will come to me there:";
B._Act20_23="Only that the Holy Spirit makes clear to me in every town that prison and pains are waiting for me.";

B._Act21_12="And hearing these things, we and those who were living in that place made request to him not to go to Jerusalem.";
B._Act21_13="Then Paul said, What are you doing, weeping and wounding my heart? for I am ready, not only to be a prisoner, but to be put to death at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.";
B._Act21_14="And as he might not be moved we did no more, saying, Let the purpose of God be done.";
B._Act21_15="And after these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.";

B._Act21_19="And when he had said how glad he was to see them, he gave them a detailed account of the things which God had done through his work among the Gentiles.";
B._Act21_20="And hearing it, they gave praise to God; and they said to him, You see, brother, what thousands there are among the Jews, who have the faith; and they all have a great respect for the law:";
B._Act21_21="And they have had news of you, how you have been teaching all the Jews among the Gentiles to give up the law of Moses, and not to give circumcision to their children, and not to keep the old rules.";
B._Act21_22="What then is the position? They will certainly get news that you have come.";
B._Act21_23="Do this, then, which we say to you: We have four men who have taken an oath;";
B._Act21_24="Go with these, and make yourself clean with them, and make the necessary payments for them, so that they may be free from their oath: and everyone will see that the statements made about you are not true, but that you put yourself under rule, and keep the law.";
B._Act21_25="But as to the Gentiles who have the faith, we sent a letter, giving our decision that they were to keep themselves from offerings made to false gods, and from blood, and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law, and from the evil desires of the body.";

B._Act21_27="And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the Temple, got the people together and put their hands on him,";
B._Act21_28="Crying out, Men of Israel, come to our help: this is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against the people and the law and this place: and in addition, he has taken Greeks into the Temple, and made this holy place unclean.";
B._Act21_29="For they had seen him before in the town with Trophimus of Ephesus, and had the idea that Paul had taken him with him into the Temple.";
B._Act21_30="And all the town was moved, and the people came running together and put their hands on Paul, pulling him out of the Temple: and then the doors were shut.";
B._Act21_31="And while they were attempting to put him to death, news came to the chief captain of the band that all Jerusalem was out of control.";
B._Act21_32="And straight away he took some armed men and went quickly down to them: and the Jews, seeing them, gave no more blows to Paul.";
B._Act21_33="Then the chief captain came near and took him, and gave orders for him to be put in chains, questioning them as to who he was and what he had done.";
B._Act21_34="And some said one thing and some another, among the people: and as he was not able to get a knowledge of the facts because of the noise, he gave orders for Paul to be taken into the army building.";
B._Act21_35="And when he came on to the steps, he was lifted up by the armed men, because of the force of the people;";
B._Act21_36="For a great mass of people came after them, crying out, Away with him!";
B._Act21_37="And when Paul was about to be taken into the building, he said to the chief captain, May I say something to you? And he said, Have you a knowledge of Greek?";
B._Act21_38="Are you by chance the Egyptian who, before this, got the people worked up against the government and took four thousand men of the Assassins out into the waste land?";
B._Act21_39="But Paul said, I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, which is not an unimportant town: I make a request to you to let me say a word to the people.";
B._Act21_40="And when he let him do so, Paul, from the steps, made a sign with his hand to the people, and when they were all quiet, he said to them in the Hebrew language,";
B._Act22_1="My brothers and fathers, give ear to the story of my life which I now put before you.";
B._Act22_2="And, hearing him talking in the Hebrew language, they became the more quiet, and he said,";
B._Act22_3="I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia by birth, but I had my education in this town at the feet of Gamaliel, being trained in the keeping of every detail of the law of our fathers; given up to the cause of God with all my heart, as you are today.";
B._Act22_4="And I made attacks on this Way, even to death, taking men and women and putting them in prison.";
B._Act22_5="Of which the high priest will be a witness, and all the rulers, from whom I had letters to the brothers; and I went into Damascus, to take those who were there as prisoners to Jerusalem for punishment.";
B._Act22_6="And it came about that while I was on my journey, coming near to Damascus, about the middle of the day, suddenly I saw a great light from heaven shining round me.";
B._Act22_7="And when I went down on the earth, a voice came to my ears saying to me, Saul, Saul, why are you attacking me so cruelly?";
B._Act22_8="And I, answering, said, Who are you; Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are attacking.";
B._Act22_9="And those who were with me saw the light, but the voice of him who was talking to me came not to their ears.";
B._Act22_10="And I said, What have I to do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Get up, and go into Damascus; and it will be made clear to you what you have to do.";
B._Act22_11="And because I was unable to see because of the glory of that light, those who were with me took me by the hand, and so I came to Damascus.";
B._Act22_12="And one Ananias, a God-fearing man, who kept the law, and of whom all the Jews in that place had a high opinion,";
B._Act22_13="Came to my side and said, Brother Saul, let your eyes be open. And in that very hour I was able to see him.";
B._Act22_14="And he said, You have been marked out by the God of our fathers to have knowledge of his purpose, and to see the Upright One and to give ear to the words of his mouth.";
B._Act22_15="For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and of what has come to your ears.";
B._Act22_16="And now, why are you waiting? get up, and have baptism, for the washing away of your sins, giving worship to his name.";
B._Act22_17="And it came about that when I had come back to Jerusalem, while I was at prayer in the Temple, my senses became more than naturally clear,";
B._Act22_18="And I saw him saying to me, Go out of Jerusalem straight away because they will not give hearing to your witness about me.";
B._Act22_19="And I said, Lord, they themselves have knowledge that I went through the Synagogues putting in prison and whipping all those who had faith in you:";
B._Act22_20="And when Stephen your witness was put to death, I was there, giving approval, and looking after the clothing of those who put him to death.";
B._Act22_21="And he said to me, Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.";
B._Act22_22="And they gave him a hearing as far as this word; then with loud voices they said, Away with this man from the earth; it is not right for him to be living.";
B._Act22_23="And while they were crying out, and pulling off their clothing, and sending dust into the air,";
B._Act22_24="The chief captain gave orders for him to be taken into the army building, saying that he would put him to the test by whipping, so that he might have knowledge of the reason why they were crying out so violently against him.";
B._Act22_25="And when they had put leather bands round him, Paul said to the captain who was present, Is it the law for you to give blows to a man who is a Roman and has not been judged?";
B._Act22_26="And hearing this, the man went to the chief captain and gave him an account of it, saying, What are you about to do? for this man is a Roman.";
B._Act22_27="And the chief captain came to him and said, Give me an answer, are you a Roman? And he said, Yes.";
B._Act22_28="And the chief captain said, I got Roman rights for myself at a great price. And Paul said, But I had them by birth.";
B._Act22_29="Then those who were about to put him to the test went away: and the chief captain was in fear, seeing that he was a Roman, and that he had put chains on him.";
B._Act22_30="But on the day after, desiring to have certain knowledge of what the Jews had to say against him, he made him free, and gave orders for the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to come together, and he took Paul and put him before them.";
B._Act23_1="And Paul, looking fixedly at the Sanhedrin, said, My brothers, my life has been upright before God till this day.";
B._Act23_2="And the high priest, Ananias, gave orders to those who were near him to give him a blow on the mouth.";
B._Act23_3="Then Paul said to him, God will give blows to you, you whitewashed wall: are you here to be my judge by law, and by your orders am I given blows against the law?";
B._Act23_4="And those who were near said, Do you say such words against God's high priest?";
B._Act23_5="And Paul said, Brother, I had no idea that he was the high priest: for it has been said, You may not say evil about the ruler of your people.";
B._Act23_6="But when Paul saw that half of them were Sadducees and the rest Pharisees, he said in the Sanhedrin, Brothers, I am a Pharisee, and the son of Pharisees: I am here to be judged on the question of the hope of the coming back from the dead.";
B._Act23_7="And when he had said this, there was an argument between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and a division in the meeting.";
B._Act23_8="For the Sadducees say that there is no coming back from the dead, and no angels or spirits: but the Pharisees have belief in all these.";
B._Act23_9="And there was a great outcry: and some of the scribes on the side of the Pharisees got up and took part in the discussion, saying, We see no evil in this man: what if he has had a revelation from an angel or a spirit?";
B._Act23_10="And when the argument became very violent, the chief captain, fearing that Paul would be pulled in two by them, gave orders to the armed men to take him by force from among them, and take him into the army building.";

B._Act23_12="And when it was day, the Jews came together and put themselves under an oath that they would take no food or drink till they had put Paul to death.";
B._Act23_13="And more than forty of them took this oath.";
B._Act23_14="And they came to the chief priests and the rulers and said, We have taken a great oath to take no food till we have put Paul to death";
B._Act23_15="So now, will you and the Sanhedrin make a request to the military authorities to have him sent down to you, as if you were desiring to go into the business in greater detail; and we, before ever he gets to you, will be waiting to put him to death.";
B._Act23_16="But Paul's sister's son had word of their design, and he came into the army building and gave news of it to Paul.";
B._Act23_17="And Paul sent for a captain and said, Take this young man to your chief, for he has news for him.";
B._Act23_18="So he took him to the chief captain and said, Paul, the prisoner, made a request to me to take this young man to you, for he has something to say to you.";
B._Act23_19="And the chief took him by the hand and, going on one side, said to him privately, What is it you have to say to me?";
B._Act23_20="And he said, The Jews are in agreement together to make a request to you for Paul to be taken, on the day after this, into the Sanhedrin, to be questioned in greater detail.";
