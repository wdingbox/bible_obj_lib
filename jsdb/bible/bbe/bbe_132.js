B._Dan10_20="Then he said, It is clear to you why I have come to you. And now I will give you an account of what is recorded in the true writings:";
B._Dan10_21="But I am going back to make war with the angel of Persia, and when I am gone, the angel of Greece will come. And there is no one on my side against these, but Michael, your angel.";
B._Dan11_1="And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede I was on his side to make his position safe and make him strong.";
B._Dan11_2="And now I will make clear to you what is true. There are still three kings to come in Persia, and the fourth will have much greater wealth than all of them: and when he has become strong through his wealth, he will put his forces in motion against all the kingdoms of Greece.";
B._Dan11_3="And a strong king will come to power, ruling with great authority and doing whatever is his pleasure.";
B._Dan11_4="And when he has become strong, his kingdom will be broken and parted to the four winds of heaven; but not to his offspring, for it will be uprooted; and his kingdom will be for the others and not for these: but not with the same authority as his.";
B._Dan11_5="And the king of the south will be strong, but one of his captains will be stronger than he and will be ruler; and his rule will be a great rule.";
B._Dan11_6="And at the end of years they will be joined together; and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she will not keep the strength of her arm; and his offspring will not keep their place; but she will be uprooted, with those who were the cause of her coming, and her son, and he who took her in those times.";
B._Dan11_7="But out of a branch from her roots one will come up to take his place, who will come against the army, forcing his way into the strong place of the king of the north, and he will take them in hand and overcome them:";
B._Dan11_8="And their gods and their metal images and their fair vessels of silver and gold he will take away into the south; and for some years he will keep away from the king of the north.";
B._Dan11_9="And he will come into the kingdom of the king of the south, but he will go back to his land.";
B._Dan11_10="And his son will make war, and will get together an army of great forces, and he will make an attack on him, overflowing and going past: and he will again take the war even to his strong place.";
B._Dan11_11="And the king of the south will be moved with wrath, and will come out and make war on him, on this same king of the north: and he will get together a great army, but the army will be given into his hand.";
B._Dan11_12="And the army will be taken away, and his heart will be uplifted: he will be the cause of the downfall of tens of thousands, but he will not be strong.";
B._Dan11_13="And again the king of the north will get together an army greater than the first; and he will make an attack on him at the end of years, with a great army and much wealth.";
B._Dan11_14="In those times, a number will take up arms against the king of the south: and the children of the violent among your people will be lifting themselves up to make the vision come true; but it will be their downfall.";
B._Dan11_15="So the king of the north will come, and put up earthworks and take a well-armed town: and the forces of the king of the south will make an attempt to keep their position, even the best of his army, but they will not have strength to do so.";
B._Dan11_16="And he who comes against him will do his pleasure, and no one will be able to keep his place before him: he will take up his position in the beautiful land and in his hand there will be destruction.";
B._Dan11_17="And it will be his purpose to come with the strength of all his kingdom, but in place of this he will make an agreement with him; and he will give him the daughter of women to send destruction on it; but this will not take place or come about.";
B._Dan11_18="After this, his face will be turned to the islands, and he will take a number of them: but a chief, by his destruction, will put an end to the shame offered by him; and more than this, he will make his shame come back on him.";
B._Dan11_19="Then his face will be turned to the strong places of his land: but his way will be stopped, causing his downfall, and he will not be seen again.";
B._Dan11_20="Then his place will be taken by one who will send out a man with the glory of a king to get wealth together; but after a short time destruction will overtake him, but not in wrath or in the fight.";
B._Dan11_21="And his place will be taken by a low person, to whom the honour of the kingdom had not been given: but he will come in time of peace and will get the kingdom by fair words.";
B._Dan11_22="And his forces will be completely taken away from before him and broken; and even the ruler of the agreement will have the same fate.";
B._Dan11_23="And from the time when they make an agreement with him, he will be working falsely: for he will take up arms suddenly with a small force,";
B._Dan11_24="Against fertile places, and will make waste a part of the country; and he will do what his fathers have not done, or his fathers' fathers; he will make distribution among them of goods taken in war and by force, and of property: he will even make designs against the strong places for a time.";
B._Dan11_25="And he will put in motion his power and his strength against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south will go to war with a very great and strong army: but he will be forced to give way, because of their designs against him;";
B._Dan11_26="And his fears will overcome him and be the cause of his downfall, and his army will come to complete destruction, and a great number will be put to the sword.";
B._Dan11_27="And as for these two kings, their hearts will be fixed on doing evil and they will say false words at one table; but it will come to nothing: for the end will be at the time fixed.";
B._Dan11_28="And he will go back to his land with great wealth; and his heart will be against the holy agreement; and he will do his pleasure and go back to his land.";
B._Dan11_29="At the time fixed he will come back and come into the south; but in the later time it will not be as it was before.";
B._Dan11_30="For those who go out from the west will come against him, and he will be in fear and will go back, full of wrath against the holy agreement; and he will do his pleasure: and he will go back and be united with those who have given up the holy agreement.";
B._Dan11_31="And armies sent by him will take up their position and they will make unclean the holy place, even the strong place, and take away the regular burned offering and put in its place an unclean thing causing fear.";
B._Dan11_32="And those who do evil against the agreement will be turned to sin by his fair words: but the people who have knowledge of their God will be strong and do well.";
B._Dan11_33="And those who are wise among the people will be the teachers of the mass of the people: but they will come to their downfall by the sword and by the flame, being made prisoners and undergoing loss for a long time.";
B._Dan11_34="Now at the time of their downfall they will have a little help, but numbers will be joined to them in the town, and in their separate heritages.";
B._Dan11_35="And some of those who are wise will have wisdom in testing themselves and making themselves clean, till the time of the end: for it is still for the fixed time.";
B._Dan11_36="And the king will do his pleasure; he will put himself on high, lifting himself over every god, and saying things to be wondered at against the God of gods; and all will be well for him till the wrath is complete; for what has been purposed will be done.";
B._Dan11_37="He will have no respect for the gods of his fathers or for the god desired by women; he will have no respect for any god: for he will put himself on high over all.";
B._Dan11_38="But in place of this he will give honour to the god of armed places, and to a god of whom his fathers had no knowledge he will give honour with gold and silver and jewels and things to be desired.";
B._Dan11_39="And he will make use of the people of a strange god to keep his strongest places; to those whom he takes note of he will give high honour: and he will make them rulers over the mass of the people, and will make division of the land for a price.";
B._Dan11_40="And at the time of the end, the king of the south will make an attack on him: and the king of the north will come against him like a storm-wind, with war-carriages and horsemen and numbers of ships; and he will go through many lands like overflowing waters.";
B._Dan11_41="And he will come into the beautiful land, and tens of thousands will be overcome: but these will be kept from falling into his hands: Edom and Moab and the chief of the children of Ammon.";
B._Dan11_42="And his hand will be stretched out on the countries: and the land of the south will not be safe from him.";
B._Dan11_43="But he will have power over the stores of gold and silver, and over all the valued things of the south: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians will be at his steps.";
B._Dan11_44="But he will be troubled by news from the east and from the north; and he will go out in great wrath, to send destruction on, and put an end to, great numbers.";
B._Dan11_45="He will put the tents of his great house between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain: but he will come to his end with no helper.";
B._Dan12_1="And at that time Michael will take up his place, the great angel, who is the supporter of the children of your people: and there will be a time of trouble, such as there never was from the time there was a nation even till that same time: and at that time your people will be kept safe, everyone who is recorded in the book.";
B._Dan12_2="And a number of those who are sleeping in the dust of the earth will come out of their sleep, some to eternal life and some to eternal shame.";
B._Dan12_3="And those who are wise will be shining like the light of the outstretched sky; and those by whom numbers have been turned to righteousness will be like the stars for ever and ever.";
B._Dan12_4="But as for you, O Daniel, let the words be kept secret and the book rolled up and kept shut till the time of the end: numbers will be going out of the way and troubles will be increased.";
B._Dan12_5="Then I, Daniel, looking, saw two others, one at the edge of the river on this side and one at the edge of the river on that side.";
B._Dan12_6="And I said to the man clothed in linen, who was over the waters of the river, How long will it be to the end of these wonders?";
B._Dan12_7="Then in my hearing the man clothed in linen, who was over the river, lifting up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, took an oath by him who is living for ever that it would be a time, times, and a half; and when the power of the crusher of the holy people comes to an end, all these things will be ended.";
B._Dan12_8="And the words came to my ears, but the sense of them was not clear to me: then I said, O my lord, what is the sense of these things?";
B._Dan12_9="And he said, Go on your way, Daniel: for the words are secret and shut up till the time of the end;";
B._Dan12_10="Till a number are tested and make themselves clean; and the evil-doers will do evil; for not one of the evil-doers will have knowledge; but all will be made clear to those who are wise.";
B._Dan12_11="And from the time when the regular burned offering is taken away, and an unclean thing causing fear is put up, there will be a thousand, two hundred and ninety days.";
B._Dan12_12="A blessing will be on the man who goes on waiting, and comes to the thousand, three hundred and thirty-five days.";
B._Dan12_13="But you, go on your way and take your rest: for you will be in your place at the end of the days.";
B._Hos1_1="The word of the Lord which came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel.";
B._Hos1_2="The start of the word of the Lord by Hosea: And the Lord said to Hosea, Go, take for yourself a wife of loose ways, and children of the same, for the land has been untrue to the Lord.";
B._Hos1_3="So he took as his wife Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, and she gave birth to a son.";
B._Hos1_4="And the Lord said to him, Give him the name of Jezreel, for after a little time I will send punishment for the blood of Jezreel on the line of Jehu, and put an end to the kingdom of Israel.";
B._Hos1_5="And in that day I will let the bow of Israel be broken in the valley of Jezreel.";
B._Hos1_6="And after that she gave birth to a daughter. And the Lord said, Give her the name Lo-ruhamah; for I will not again have mercy on Israel, to give them forgiveness.";
B._Hos1_7="But I will have mercy on Judah and will give them salvation by the Lord their God, but not by the bow or the sword or by fighting or by horses or horsemen.";
B._Hos1_8="Now when Lo-ruhamah had been taken from the breast, the woman gave birth to a son.";
B._Hos1_9="And the Lord said, Give him the name Lo-ammi; for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.";
B._Hos1_10="But still the number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea, which may not be measured or numbered; and in place of its being said to them, You are not my people, it will be said to them, You are the sons of the living God";
B._Hos1_11="And the children of Israel and the children of Judah will come together and take for themselves one head, and will go up from the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel.";
B._Hos2_1="Say to your brothers, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.";
B._Hos2_2="Take up the cause against your mother, take it up, for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband; let her put away her loose ways from her face, and her false ways from between her breasts;";
B._Hos2_3="For fear that I may take away her robe from her, making her uncovered as in the day of her birth; making her like a waste place and a dry land, causing her death through need of water.";
B._Hos2_4="And I will have no mercy on her children, for they are the children of her loose ways.";
B._Hos2_5="For their mother has been untrue; she who gave them birth has done things of shame, for she said, I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my wine.";
B._Hos2_6="For this cause I will put thorns in her road, building up a wall round her so that she may not go on her way.";
B._Hos2_7="And if she goes after her lovers she will not overtake them; if she makes search for them she will not see them; then will she say, I will go back to my first husband, for then it was better for me than now.";
B._Hos2_8="For she had no knowledge that it was I who gave her the grain and the wine and the oil, increasing her silver and gold which they gave to the Baal.";
B._Hos2_9="So I will take away again my grain in its time and my wine, and I will take away my wool and my linen with which her body might have been covered.";
B._Hos2_10="And now I will make her shame clear before the eyes of her lovers, and no one will take her out of my hand.";
B._Hos2_11="And I will put an end to all her joy, her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her regular meetings.";
B._Hos2_12="And I will make waste her vines and her fig-trees, of which she has said, These are the payments which my lovers have made to me; and I will make them a waste of trees, and the beasts of the field will take them for food.";
B._Hos2_13="And I will give her punishment for the days of the Baals, to whom she has been burning perfumes, when she made herself fair with her nose-rings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, giving no thought to me, says the Lord.";
B._Hos2_14="For this cause I will make her come into the waste land and will say words of comfort to her.";
B._Hos2_15="And I will give her vine-gardens from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she will give her answer there as in the days when she was young, and as in the time when she came up out of the land of Egypt.";
B._Hos2_16="And in that day, says the Lord, you will say to me, Ishi; and you will never again give me the name of Baali;";
B._Hos2_17="For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and never again will she say their names.";
B._Hos2_18="And in that day I will make an agreement for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven and the things which go low on the earth; I will put an end to the bow and the sword and war in all the land, and will make them take their rest in peace.";
B._Hos2_19="And I will take you as my bride for ever; truly, I will take you as my bride in righteousness and in right judging, in love and in mercies.";
B._Hos2_20="I will take you as my bride in good faith, and you will have knowledge of the Lord.";
B._Hos2_21="And it will be, in that day, says the Lord, that I will give an answer to the heavens, and the heavens to the earth;";
B._Hos2_22="And the earth will give its answer to the grain and the wine and the oil, and they will give an answer to Jezreel;";
B._Hos2_23="And I will put her as seed in the earth, and I will have mercy on her to whom no mercy was given; and I will say to those who were not my people, You are my people, and they will say, My God.";
B._Hos3_1="And the Lord said to me, Give your love again to a woman who has a lover and is false to her husband, even as the Lord has love for the children of Israel, though they are turned to other gods and are lovers of grape-cakes.";
B._Hos3_2="So I got her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a half of barley;";
B._Hos3_3="And I said to her, You are to be mine for a long space of time; you are not to be false to me, and no other man is to have you for his wife; and so will I be to you.";
B._Hos3_4="For the children of Israel will for a long time be without king and without ruler, without offerings and without pillars, and without ephod or images.";
B._Hos3_5="And after that, the children of Israel will come back and go in search of the Lord their God and David their king; and they will come in fear to the Lord and to his mercies in the days to come.";
B._Hos4_1="Give ear to the word of the Lord, O children of Israel; for the Lord has a cause against the people of this land, because there is no good faith in it, and no mercy and no knowledge of God in the land.";
B._Hos4_2="There is cursing and broken faith, violent death and attacks on property, men are untrue in married life, houses are broken into, and there is blood touching blood.";
B._Hos4_3="Because of this the land will be dry, and everyone living in it will be wasted away, with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven; even the fishes of the sea will be taken away.";
B._Hos4_4="Let no man go to law or make protests, for your people are like those who go to law with a priest.";
B._Hos4_5="You will not be able to keep on your feet by day, and by night the prophet will be falling down with you, and I will give your mother to destruction.";
B._Hos4_6="Destruction has overtaken my people because they have no knowledge; because you have given up knowledge, I will give you up, so that you will be no priest to me, because you have not kept in mind the law of your God, I will not keep your children in my memory.";
B._Hos4_7="Even while they were increasing in number they were sinning against me; I will let their glory be changed into shame.";
B._Hos4_8="The sin of my people is like food to them; and their desire is for their wrongdoing.";
B._Hos4_9="And the priest will be like the people; I will give them punishment for their evil ways, and the reward of their acts.";
B._Hos4_10="They will have food, but they will not be full; they will be false to me, but they will not be increased, because they no longer give thought to the Lord.";
B._Hos4_11="Loose ways and new wine take away wisdom.";
B._Hos4_12="My people get knowledge from their tree, and their rod gives them news; for a false spirit is the cause of their wandering, and they have been false to their God.";
B._Hos4_13="They make offerings on the tops of mountains, burning perfumes in high places, under trees of every sort, because their shade is good: and so your daughters are given up to loose ways and your brides are false to their husbands.";
B._Hos4_14="I will not give punishment to your daughters or your brides for their evil behaviour; for they make themselves separate with loose women, and make offerings with those who are used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods: the people who have no wisdom will be sent away.";
B._Hos4_15="Do not you, O Israel, come into error; do not you, O Judah, come to Gilgal, or go up to Beth-aven, or take an oath, By the living Lord.";
B._Hos4_16="For Israel is uncontrolled, like a cow which may not be controlled; now will the Lord give them food like a lamb in a wide place.";
B._Hos4_17="Ephraim is joined to false gods; let him be.";
B._Hos4_18="Their drink has become bitter; they are completely false; her rulers take pleasure in shame.";
B._Hos4_19="They are folded in the skirts of the wind; they will be shamed because of their offerings.";
B._Hos5_1="Give ear to this, O priests; give attention, O Israel, and you, family of the king; for you are to be judged; you have been a deceit at Mizpah and a net stretched out on Tabor.";
B._Hos5_2="They have gone deep in the evil ways of Shittim, but I am the judge of all.";
B._Hos5_3="I have knowledge of Ephraim, and Israel is not secret from me; for now, O Ephraim, you have been false to me, Israel has become unclean.";
B._Hos5_4="Their works will not let them come back to their God, for a false spirit is in them and they have no knowledge of the Lord.";
B._Hos5_5="And the pride of Israel gives an answer to his face; and Ephraim will have a fall through his sins, and the fall of Judah will be the same as theirs.";
B._Hos5_6="They will go, with their flocks and their herds, in search of the Lord, but they will not see him; he has taken himself out of their view.";
B._Hos5_7="They have been false to the Lord; they have given birth to strange children; now the new moon will make them waste with their fields.";
B._Hos5_8="Let the horn be sounded in Gibeah and in Ramah; give a loud cry in Beth-aven, They are after you, O Benjamin.";
B._Hos5_9="Ephraim will become a waste in the day of punishment; I have given knowledge among the tribes of Israel of what is certain.";
B._Hos5_10="The rulers of Judah are like those who take away a landmark; I will let loose my wrath on them like flowing water.";
B._Hos5_11="Ephraim is troubled; he is crushed by his judges, because he took pleasure in walking after deceit.";
B._Hos5_12="And so to Ephraim I am like a wasting insect, and a destruction to the children of Judah.";
B._Hos5_13="When Ephraim saw his disease and Judah his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria and sent to the great king; but he is not able to make you well or give you help for your wound.";
B._Hos5_14="For I will be to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the children of Judah; I, even I, will give him wounds and go away; I will take him away, and there will be no helper.";
B._Hos5_15="I will go back to my place till they are made waste; in their trouble they will go after me early and will make search for me.";
B._Hos6_1="Come, let us go back to the Lord; for he has given us wounds and he will make us well; he has given blows and he will give help.";
B._Hos6_2="After two days he will give us life, and on the third day he will make us get up, and we will be living before him.";
B._Hos6_3="And let us have knowledge, let us go after the knowledge of the Lord; his going out is certain as the dawn, his decisions go out like the light; he will come to us like the rain, like the spring rain watering the earth.";
B._Hos6_4="O Ephraim, what am I to do to you? O Judah, what am I to do to you? For your love is like a morning cloud, and like the dew which goes early away.";
B._Hos6_5="So I have had it cut in stones; I gave them teaching by the words of my mouth;";
B._Hos6_6="Because my desire is for mercy and not offerings; for the knowledge of God more than for burned offerings.";
B._Hos6_7="But like a man, they have gone against the agreement; there they were false to me.";
B._Hos6_8="Gilead is a town of evil-doers, marked with blood.";
B._Hos6_9="And like a band of thieves waiting for a man, so are the priests watching secretly the way of those going quickly to Shechem, for they are working with an evil design.";
B._Hos6_10="In Israel I have seen a very evil thing; there false ways are seen in Ephraim, Israel is unclean;";
B._Hos6_11="And Judah has put up disgusting images for himself.";
B._Hos7_1="When my desire was for the fate of my people to be changed and to make Israel well, then the sin of Ephraim was made clear, and the evil-doing of Samaria; for their ways are false, and the thief comes into the house, while the band of outlaws takes property by force in the streets.";
