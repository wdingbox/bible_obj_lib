B._Neh4_16="And from that time, half of my servants were doing their part of the work, and half kept the spears and body-covers and the bows and the metal war-dresses; and the chiefs were at the back of the men of Judah.";
B._Neh4_17="Those who were building the wall and those who were moving material did their part, everyone working with one hand, with his spear in the other;";
B._Neh4_18="Every builder was working with his sword at his side. And by my side was a man for sounding the horn.";
B._Neh4_19="And I said to the great ones and the chiefs and the rest of the people, The work is great and widely spaced and we are far away from one another on the wall:";
B._Neh4_20="Wherever you may be when the horn is sounded, come here to us; our God will be fighting for us.";
B._Neh4_21="So we went on with the work: and half of them had spears in their hands from the dawn of the morning till the stars were seen.";
B._Neh4_22="And at the same time I said to the people, Let everyone with his servant come inside Jerusalem for the night, so that at night they may keep watch for us, and go on working by day.";
B._Neh4_23="So not one of us, I or my brothers or my servants or the watchmen who were with me, took off his clothing, everyone went armed to the water.";
B._Neh5_1="Then there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their countrymen the Jews.";
B._Neh5_2="For there were some who said, We, our sons and our daughters, are a great number: let us get grain, so that we may have food for our needs.";
B._Neh5_3="And there were some who said, We are giving our fields and our vine-gardens and our houses for debt: let us get grain because we are in need.";
B._Neh5_4="And there were others who said, We have given up our fields and our vine-gardens to get money for the king's taxes.";
B._Neh5_5="But our flesh is the same as the flesh of our countrymen, and our children as their children: and now we are giving our sons and daughters into the hands of others, to be their servants, and some of our daughters are servants even now: and we have no power to put a stop to it; for other men have our fields and our vine-gardens.";
B._Neh5_6="And on hearing their outcry and what they said I was very angry.";
B._Neh5_7="And after turning it over in my mind, I made a protest to the chiefs and the rulers, and said to them, Every one of you is taking interest from his countryman. And I got together a great meeting of protest.";
B._Neh5_8="And I said to them, We have given whatever we were able to give, to make our brothers the Jews free, who were servants and prisoners of the nations: and would you now give up your brothers for a price, and are they to become our property? Then they said nothing, answering not a word.";
B._Neh5_9="And I said, What you are doing is not good: is it not the more necessary for you to go in the fear of our God, because of the shame which the nations may put on us?";
B._Neh5_10="Even I and my servants have been taking interest for the money and the grain we have let them have. So now, let us give up this thing.";
B._Neh5_11="Give back to them this very day their fields, their vine-gardens, their olive-gardens, and their houses, as well as a hundredth part of the money and the grain and the wine and the oil which you have taken from them.";
B._Neh5_12="Then they said, We will give them back, and take nothing for them; we will do as you say. Then I sent for the priests and made them take an oath that they would keep this agreement.";
B._Neh5_13="And shaking out the folds of my robe, I said, So may God send out from his house and his work every man who does not keep this agreement; even so let him be sent out and made as nothing. And all the meeting of the people said, So be it, and gave praise to the Lord. And the people did as they had said.";
B._Neh5_14="Now from the time when I was made ruler of the people in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year till the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, for twelve years, I and my servants have never taken the food which was the right of the ruler.";
B._Neh5_15="But earlier rulers who were before me made the people responsible for their upkeep, and took from them bread and wine at the rate of forty shekels of silver; and even their servants were lords over the people: but I did not do so, because of the fear of God.";
B._Neh5_16="And I kept on with the work of this wall, and we got no land for ourselves: and all my servants were helping with the work.";
B._Neh5_17="And more than this, a hundred and fifty of the Jews and the rulers were guests at my table, in addition to those who came to us from the nations round about us.";
B._Neh5_18="Now the food made ready for one day was one ox and six fat sheep, as well as fowls; and once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine: but all the same, I did not take the food to which the ruler had a right, because the people were crushed under a hard yoke.";
B._Neh5_19="Keep in mind, O my God, for my good, all I have done for this people.";
B._Neh6_1="Now when word was given to Sanballat and Tobiah and to Geshem the Arabian and to the rest of our haters, that I had done the building of the wall and that there were no more broken places in it (though even then I had not put up the doors in the doorways);";
B._Neh6_2="Sanballat and Geshem sent to me saying, Come, let us have a meeting in one of the little towns in the lowland of Ono. But their purpose was to do me evil.";
B._Neh6_3="And I sent men to them saying, I am doing a great work, so that it is not possible for me to come down: is the work to be stopped while I go away from it and come down to you?";
B._Neh6_4="And four times they sent to me in this way, and I sent them the same answer.";
B._Neh6_5="Then Sanballat sent his servant to me a fifth time with an open letter in his hand;";
B._Neh6_6="And in it these words were recorded: It is said among the nations, and Geshem says so, that you and the Jews are hoping to make yourselves free from the king's authority; and that this is why you are building the wall: and they say that it is your purpose to be their king;";
B._Neh6_7="And that you have prophets preaching about you in Jerusalem, and saying, There is a king in Judah: now an account of these things will be sent to the king. So come now, and let us have a discussion.";
B._Neh6_8="Then I sent to him, saying, No such things as you say are being done, they are only a fiction you have made up yourself.";
B._Neh6_9="For they were hoping to put fear in us, saying, Their hands will become feeble and give up the work so that it may not get done. But now, O God, make my hands strong.";
B._Neh6_10="And I went to the house of Shemaiah, the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us have a meeting in the house of God, inside the Temple, and let the doors be shut: for they will come to put you to death; truly, in the night they will come to put you to death.";
B._Neh6_11="And I said, Am I the sort of man to go in flight? what man, in my position, would go into the Temple to keep himself safe? I will not go in.";
B._Neh6_12="Then it became clear to me that God had not sent him: he had given this word of a prophet against me himself: and Tobiah and Sanballat had given him money to do so.";
B._Neh6_13="For this reason they had given him money, in order that I might be overcome by fear and do what he said and do wrong, and so they would have reason to say evil about me and put shame on me.";
B._Neh6_14="Keep in mind, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat and what they did, and Noadiah, the woman prophet, and the rest of the prophets whose purpose was to put fear into me.";
B._Neh6_15="So the wall was complete on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.";
B._Neh6_16="And when our haters had news of this, all the nations round about us were full of fear and were greatly shamed, for they saw that this work had been done by our God.";
B._Neh6_17="And further, in those days the chiefs of Judah sent a number of letters to Tobiah, and his letters came to them.";
B._Neh6_18="For in Judah there were a number of people who had made an agreement by oath with him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah, the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken as his wife the daughter of Meshullam, the son of Berechiah.";
B._Neh6_19="And they said much before me of the good he had done, and gave him accounts of my words. And Tobiah sent letters with the purpose of causing me fear.";
B._Neh7_1="Now when the building of the wall was complete and I had put up the doors, and the door-keepers and the music-makers and the Levites had been given their places,";
B._Neh7_2="I made my brother Hanani, and Hananiah, the ruler of the tower, responsible for the government of Jerusalem: for he was a man of good faith, fearing God more than most.";
B._Neh7_3="And I said to them, Do not let the doors of Jerusalem be open till the sun is high; and while the watchmen are in their places, let the doors be shut and locked: and let the people of Jerusalem be put on watch, every one in his watch, opposite his house.";
B._Neh7_4="Now the town was wide and great: but the people in it were only a small number, and the houses had not been put up.";
B._Neh7_5="And my God put it into my heart to get together the rulers and the chiefs and the people so that they might be listed by families. And I came across a record of the names of those who came up at the first, and in it I saw these words:";
B._Neh7_6="These are the people of the divisions of the kingdom, among those who had been made prisoners by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and taken away by him, who went back to Jerusalem and Judah, every one to his town;";

B._Neh9_5="Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said, Get up and give praise to the Lord your God for ever and ever. Praise be to your great name which is lifted up high over all blessing and praise.";
B._Neh9_6="You are the Lord, even you only; you have made heaven, the heaven of heavens with all their armies, the earth and all things in it, the seas and everything in them; and you keep them from destruction: and the armies of heaven are your worshippers.";
B._Neh9_7="You are the Lord, the God, who took Abram and made him yours, guiding him from Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham;";
B._Neh9_8="You saw that his heart was true to you, and made an agreement with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite and the Girgashite, even to give it to his seed, and you have done what you said; for righteousness is yours:";
B._Neh9_9="And you saw the trouble of our fathers in Egypt, and their cry came to your ears by the Red Sea;";
B._Neh9_10="And you did signs and wonders on Pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land; for you saw how cruel they were to them. So you got yourself a name as it is today.";
B._Neh9_11="By you the sea was parted before them, so that they went through the sea on dry land; and those who went after them went down into the deep, like a stone into great waters.";
B._Neh9_12="And you went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light on the way they were to go.";
B._Neh9_13="And you came down on Mount Sinai, and your voice came to them from heaven, giving them right decisions and true laws, good rules and orders:";
B._Neh9_14="And you gave them word of your holy Sabbath, and gave them orders and rules and a law, by the hand of Moses your servant:";
B._Neh9_15="And you gave them bread from heaven when they were in need, and made water come out of the rock for their drink, and gave them orders to go in and take for their heritage the land which your hand had been lifted up to give them.";
B._Neh9_16="But they and our fathers, in their pride, made their necks stiff, and gave no attention to your orders,";
B._Neh9_17="And would not do them, and gave no thought to the wonders you had done among them; but made their necks stiff, and turning away from you, made a captain over themselves to take them back to their prison in Egypt: but you are a God of forgiveness, full of grace and pity, slow to wrath and great in mercy, and you did not give them up.";
B._Neh9_18="Even when they had made for themselves an ox of metal, and said, This is your God who took you up out of Egypt, and had done so much to make you angry;";
B._Neh9_19="Even then, in your great mercy, you did not give them up in the waste land: the pillar of cloud still went before them by day, guiding them on their way, and the pillar of fire by night, to give them light, and make clear the way they were to go.";
B._Neh9_20="And you gave your good spirit to be their teacher, and did not keep back your manna from their mouths, and gave them water when they had need of it.";
B._Neh9_21="Truly, for forty years you were their support in the waste land, and they were in need of nothing; their clothing did not get old or their feet become tired.";
B._Neh9_22="And you gave them kingdoms and peoples, making distribution to them in every part of the land: so they took for their heritage the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, king of Bashan.";
B._Neh9_23="And you made their children as great in number as the stars of heaven, and took them into the land, of which you had said to their fathers that they were to go in and take it for themselves.";
B._Neh9_24="So the children went in and took the land, and you overcame before them the people of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them up into their hands, with their kings and the people of the land, so that they might do with them whatever it was their pleasure to do.";
