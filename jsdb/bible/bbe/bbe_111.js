B._Jer5_10="Go up against her vines and make waste; let the destruction be complete: take away her branches, for they are not the Lord's.";
B._Jer5_11="For the people of Israel and the people of Judah have been very false to me, says the Lord.";
B._Jer5_12="They would have nothing to do with the Lord, saying, He will do nothing, and no evil will come to us; we will not see the sword or be short of food:";
B._Jer5_13="And the prophets will become wind, and the word is not in them; so it will be done to them.";
B._Jer5_14="For this reason the Lord, the God of armies, has said: Because you have said this, I will make my words in your mouth a fire, and this people wood, and they will be burned up by it.";
B._Jer5_15="See, I will send you a nation from far away, O people of Israel, says the Lord; a strong nation and an old nation, a nation whose language is strange to you, so that you may not get the sense of their words.";
B._Jer5_16="Their arrows give certain death, they are all men of war.";
B._Jer5_17="They will take all the produce of your fields, which would have been food for your sons and your daughters: they will take your flocks and your herds: they will take all your vines and your fig-trees: and with the sword they will make waste your walled towns in which you put your faith.";
B._Jer5_18="But even in those days, says the Lord, I will not let your destruction be complete.";
B._Jer5_19="And it will come about, when you say, Why has the Lord our God done all these things to us? that you will say to them, As you gave me up, making yourselves servants to strange gods in your land, so will you be servants to strange men in a land which is not yours.";
B._Jer5_20="Say this openly in Jacob and give it out in Judah, saying,";
B._Jer5_21="Give ear now to this, O foolish people without sense; who have eyes but see nothing, and ears without the power of hearing:";
B._Jer5_22="Have you no fear of me? says the Lord; will you not be shaking with fear before me, who have put the sand as a limit for the sea, by an eternal order, so that it may not go past it? and though it is ever in motion, it is not able to have its way; though the sound of its waves is loud, they are not able to go past it.";
B._Jer5_23="But the heart of this people is uncontrolled and turned away from me; they are broken loose and gone.";
B._Jer5_24="And they do not say in their hearts, Now let us give worship to our God, who gives the rain, the winter and the spring rain, at the right time; who keeps for us the ordered weeks of the grain-cutting.";
B._Jer5_25="Through your evil-doing these things have been turned away, and your sins have kept back good from you.";
B._Jer5_26="For there are sinners among my people: they keep watch, like men watching for birds; they put a net and take men in it.";
B._Jer5_27="As the fowl-house is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: for this reason they have become great and have got wealth.";
B._Jer5_28="They have become fat and strong: they have gone far in works of evil: they give no support to the cause of the child without a father, so that they may do well; they do not see that the poor man gets his rights.";

B._Jer6_5="Up! let us go up by night, and send destruction on her great houses.";
B._Jer6_6="For this is what the Lord of armies has said: Let trees be cut down and an earthwork be placed against Jerusalem: sorrow on the false town! inside her there is nothing but cruel ways.";
B._Jer6_7="As the spring keeps its waters cold, so she keeps her evil in her: the sound of cruel and violent behaviour is in her; before me at all times are disease and wounds.";
B._Jer6_8="Undergo teaching, O Jerusalem, or my soul will be turned away from you, and I will make you a waste, an unpeopled land.";
B._Jer6_9="This is what the Lord of armies has said: Everything will be taken from the rest of Israel as the last grapes are taken from the vine; let your hand be turned to the small branches, like one pulling off grapes.";
B._Jer6_10="To whom am I to give word, witnessing so that they may take note? see, their ears are stopped, and they are not able to give attention: see, the word of the Lord has been a cause of shame to them, they have no delight in it.";
B._Jer6_11="For this reason I am full of the wrath of the Lord, I am tired of keeping it in: may it be let loose on the children in the street, and on the band of the young men together: for even the husband with his wife will be taken, the old man with him who is full of days.";
B._Jer6_12="And their houses will be handed over to others, their fields and their wives together: for my hand will be stretched out against the people of the land, says the Lord.";
B._Jer6_13="For from the least of them even to the greatest, everyone is given up to getting money; from the prophet even to the priest, everyone is working deceit.";
B._Jer6_14="And they have made little of the wounds of my people, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.";
B._Jer6_15="Let them be put to shame because they have done disgusting things. They had no shame, they were not able to become red with shame: so they will come down with those who are falling: when my punishment comes on them, they will be made low, says the Lord.";
B._Jer6_16="This is what the Lord has said: Take your place looking out on the ways; make search for the old roads, saying, Where is the good way? and go in it that you may have rest for your souls. But they said, We will not go in it.";
B._Jer6_17="And I put watchmen over you, saying, Give attention to the sound of the horn; but they said, We will not give attention.";
B._Jer6_18="So then, give ear, you nations, and ...";
B._Jer6_19="Give ear, O earth: see, I will make evil come on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not given attention to my words, and they would have nothing to do with my law.";
B._Jer6_20="To what purpose does sweet perfume come to me from Sheba, and spices from a far country? your burned offerings give me no pleasure, your offerings of beasts are not pleasing to me.";

B._Jer7_6="If you are not cruel to the man from a strange country, and to the child without a father, and to the widow, and do not put the upright to death in this place, or go after other gods, causing damage to yourselves:";
B._Jer7_7="Then I will let you go on living in this place, in the land which I gave to your fathers in the past and for ever.";
B._Jer7_8="See, you put your faith in false words which are of no profit.";
B._Jer7_9="Will you take the goods of others, put men to death, and be untrue to your wives, and take false oaths, and have perfumes burned to the Baal, and go after other gods which are strange to you;";

B._Jer7_11="Has this house, which is named by my name, become a hole of thieves to you? Truly I, even I, have seen it, says the Lord.";
B._Jer7_12="But go now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I put my name at first, and see what I did to it because of the evil-doing of my people Israel.";
B._Jer7_13="And now, because you have done all these works, says the Lord, and I sent my word to you, getting up early and sending, but you did not give ear; and my voice came to you, but you gave no answer:";
B._Jer7_14="For this reason I will do to the house which is named by my name, and in which you have put your faith, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.";
B._Jer7_15="And I will send you away from before my face, as I have sent away all your brothers, even all the seed of Ephraim.";
B._Jer7_16="And as for you (Jeremiah), make no prayers for this people, send up no cry or prayer for them, make no request for them to me: for I will not give ear.";
B._Jer7_17="Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?";
B._Jer7_18="The children go for wood, the fathers get the fire burning, the women are working the paste to make cakes for the queen of heaven, and drink offerings are drained out to other gods, moving me to wrath.";
B._Jer7_19="Are they moving me to wrath? says the Lord; are they not moving themselves to their shame?";
B._Jer7_20="So this is what the Lord God has said: See, my wrath and my passion will be let loose on this place, on man and beast, and on the trees of the field, and on the produce of the earth; it will be burning and will not be put out.";
B._Jer7_21="These are the words of the Lord of armies, the God of Israel: Put your burned offerings with your offerings of beasts, and take flesh for your food.";
B._Jer7_22="For I said nothing to your fathers, and gave them no orders, on the day when I took them out of Egypt, about burned offerings or offerings of beasts:";
B._Jer7_23="But this was the order I gave them, saying, Give ear to my voice, and I will be your God, and you will be my people: go in all the way ordered by me, so that all may be well for you.";

B._Jer7_26="But still they took no note and would not give ear, but they made their necks stiff, doing worse than their fathers.";
B._Jer7_27="And you are to say all these words to them, but they will not give ear to you: you will send out your voice to them, but they will give no answer.";
B._Jer7_28="And you are to say to them, This is the nation which has not given ear to the voice of their God, or taken his teaching to heart: good faith is dead and is cut off from their mouths.";
B._Jer7_29="Let your hair be cut off, O Jerusalem, and let it go, and let a song of grief go up on the open hilltops; for the Lord is turned away from the generation of his wrath and has given them up.";
B._Jer7_30="For the children of Judah have done what is evil in my eyes, says the Lord: they have put their disgusting images in the house which is named by my name, making it unclean.";
B._Jer7_31="And they have put up the high place of Topheth in the valley of the son of Hinnom, burning their sons and their daughters there in the fire; a thing which was not ordered by me and never came into my mind.";
B._Jer7_32="For this cause, the days are coming, says the Lord, when it will no longer be named Topheth, or, The valley of the son of Hinnom, but, The valley of Death: for they will put the dead into the earth in Topheth till there is no more room.";
B._Jer7_33="And the bodies of this people will be food for the birds of heaven and for the beasts of the earth; and there will be no one to send them away.";
B._Jer7_34="And in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, I will put an end to the laughing voices, the voice of joy and the voice of the newly-married man and the voice of the bride: for the land will become a waste.";
B._Jer8_1="At that time, says the Lord, they will take the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his rulers, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the people of Jerusalem out of their resting-places:";
B._Jer8_2="And they will put them out before the sun and the moon and all the stars of heaven, whose lovers and servants they have been, after whom they have gone, to whom they have made prayers, and to whom they have given worship: they will not be put together or placed in the earth; they will be waste on the face of the earth.";
B._Jer8_3="And death will be desired more than life by the rest of this evil family who are still living in all the places where I have sent them away, says the Lord of armies.";
B._Jer8_4="Further, you are to say to them, This is what the Lord has said: Will those who are falling not be lifted up again? will he who has gone away not come back?";
B._Jer8_5="Why do these people of Jerusalem go back, for ever turning away? they will not give up their deceit, they will not come back.";
B._Jer8_6="I took note and gave ear, but no one said what is right: no man had regret for his evil-doing, saying, What have I done? everyone goes off on his way like a horse rushing to the fight.";
B._Jer8_7="Truly, the stork in the heavens is conscious of her fixed times; the dove and the swallow and the crane keep to the times of their coming; but my people have no knowledge of the law of the Lord.";
B._Jer8_8="How is it that you say, We are wise and the law of the Lord is with us? But see, the false pen of the scribes has made it false.";
B._Jer8_9="The wise men are shamed, they are overcome with fear and taken: see, they have given up the word of the Lord; and what use is their wisdom to them?";
B._Jer8_10="So I will give their wives to others, and their fields to those who will take them for themselves: for everyone, from the least to the greatest, is given up to getting money; from the priest even to the prophet, everyone is false.";
B._Jer8_11="And they have made little of the wounds of the daughter of Zion, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.";
B._Jer8_12="Let them be put to shame because they have done disgusting things. They had no shame, they were not able to become red with shame: so they will come down with those who are falling: in the time of their punishment they will be made low, says the Lord.";
B._Jer8_13="I will put an end to them completely, says the Lord: there are no grapes on the vine and no figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf is dry.";
B._Jer8_14="Why are we seated doing nothing? come together, and let us go to the walled towns, and let destruction overtake us there, for the Lord our God has sent destruction on us, and given us bitter water for our drink, because we have done evil against the Lord.";
B._Jer8_15="We were looking for peace, but no good came; and for a time of well-being, but there is only a great fear.";
B._Jer8_16="The loud breathing of the horses comes to our ears from Dan: at the sound of the outcry of his war-horses, all the land is shaking with fear; for they have come, and have made a meal of the land and everything in it; the town and the people living in it.";
B._Jer8_17="See, I will send snakes and poison-snakes among you, against which the wonder-worker has no power; and they will give you wounds which may not be made well, says the Lord.";
B._Jer8_18="Sorrow has come on me! my heart in me is feeble.";
B._Jer8_19="The voice of the cry of the daughter of my people comes from a far land: Is the Lord not in Zion? is not her King in her? Why have they made me angry with their images and their strange gods which are no gods?";
B._Jer8_20="The grain-cutting is past, the summer is ended, and no salvation has come to us.";
B._Jer8_21="For the destruction of the daughter of my people I am broken: I am dressed in the clothing of grief; fear has taken me in its grip.";
B._Jer8_22="Is there no life-giving oil in Gilead? is there no expert in medical arts? why then have my people not been made well?";
B._Jer9_1="If only my head was a stream of waters and my eyes fountains of weeping, so that I might go on weeping day and night for the dead of the daughter of my people!";
B._Jer9_2="If only I had in the waste land a night's resting-place for travellers, so that I might go away, far from my people! for they are all untrue, a band of false men.";
B._Jer9_3="Their tongues are bent like a bow to send out false words: they have become strong in the land, but not for good faith: they go on from evil to evil, and they have no knowledge of me, says the Lord.";
B._Jer9_4="Let everyone keep watch on his neighbour, and put no faith in any brother: for every brother will certainly be tricking his brother, and every neighbour will go about saying evil.";
B._Jer9_5="Everyone will make sport of his neighbour with deceit, not saying what is true: their tongues have been trained to say false words; they are twisted, hating to come back.";
B._Jer9_6="There is wrong on wrong, deceit on deceit; they have given up the knowledge of me, says the Lord.";
B._Jer9_7="So the Lord of armies has said, See, I will make them soft in the fire and put them to the test; this I will do because of their evil-doing.";
B._Jer9_8="His tongue is an arrow causing death; the words of his mouth are deceit: he says words of peace to his neighbour, but in his heart he is waiting secretly for him.";
B._Jer9_9="Am I not to send punishment for these things? says the Lord: will not my soul take payment from such a nation as this?";
B._Jer9_10="Give yourselves to weeping, crying out in sorrow for the mountains; and for the fields of the waste land send up a song of grief, because they are burned up, so that no one goes through; there is no sound of cattle; the bird of the heavens and the beast are in flight and are gone.";
B._Jer9_11="And I will make Jerusalem a mass of broken stones, the living-place of jackals; and I will make the towns of Judah a waste, with no man living there.";
B._Jer9_12="Who is the wise man able to see this? who is he to whom the word of the Lord has come, so that he may make it clear? why is the land given to destruction and burned up like a waste place, so that no one goes through?";
B._Jer9_13="And the Lord said, Because they have given up my law which I put before them, giving no attention to my voice and not being guided by it;";
B._Jer9_14="But they have been walking in the pride of their hearts, going after the Baals, as their fathers gave them teaching.";
B._Jer9_15="So the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said, I will give them, even this people, bitter plants for food and bitter water for drink.";
B._Jer9_16="And I will send them wandering among the nations, among people strange to them and to their fathers: and I will send the sword after them till I have put an end to them.";
B._Jer9_17="This is what the Lord of armies has said: Take thought and send for the weeping women, so that they may come; and send for the wise women, so that they may come:";
B._Jer9_18="Let them quickly make cries of sorrow for us, so that drops may be flowing from our eyes till they are streaming with water.";
B._Jer9_19="For a sound of weeping goes up from Zion, a cry, How has destruction come on us? we are overcome with shame because we have gone away from our land; he has sent us out from our house.";
B._Jer9_20="But even now, give ear to the word of the Lord, O you women; let your ears be open to the word of his mouth, training your daughters to give cries of sorrow, everyone teaching her neighbour a song of grief.";
B._Jer9_21="For death has come up into our windows, forcing its way into our great houses; cutting off the children in the streets and the young men in the wide places.";
B._Jer9_22="The bodies of men will be falling like waste on the open fields, and like grain dropped by the grain-cutter, and no one will take them up.";
B._Jer9_23="This is the word of the Lord: Let not the wise man take pride in his wisdom, or the strong man in his strength, or the man of wealth in his wealth:";
B._Jer9_24="But if any man has pride, let it be in this, that he has the wisdom to have knowledge of me, that I am the Lord, working mercy, giving true decisions, and doing righteousness in the earth: for in these things I have delight, says the Lord.";
B._Jer9_25="See, the day is coming, says the Lord, when I will send punishment on all those who have circumcision in the flesh;";
B._Jer9_26="On Egypt and on Judah and on Edom and on the children of Ammon and on Moab and on all who have the ends of their hair cut, who are living in the waste land: for all these nations and all the people of Israel are without circumcision in their hearts.";

B._Jer10_2="This is what the Lord has said: Do not go in the way of the nations; have no fear of the signs of heaven, for the nations go in fear of them.";
B._Jer10_3="For that which is feared by the people is foolish: it is the work of the hands of the workman; for a tree is cut down by him out of the woods with his axe.";
B._Jer10_4="They make it beautiful with silver and gold; they make it strong with nails and hammers, so that it may not be moved.";
B._Jer10_5="It is like a pillar in a garden of plants, and has no voice: it has to be lifted, for it has no power of walking. Have no fear of it; for it has no power of doing evil and it is not able to do any good.";
B._Jer10_6="There is no one like you, O Lord; you are great and your name is great in power.";
B._Jer10_7="Who would not have fear of you, O King of the nations? for it is your right: for among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is no one like you.";
B._Jer10_8="But they are together like beasts and foolish: the teaching of false gods is wood.";
B._Jer10_9="Silver hammered into plates is sent from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the expert workman and of the hands of the gold-worker; blue and purple is their clothing, all the work of expert men.";
