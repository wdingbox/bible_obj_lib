B._2Sa19_11="And King David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, Say to the responsible men of Judah, Why are you the last to take steps to get the king back to his house?";
B._2Sa19_12="You are my brothers, my bone and my flesh; why are you the last to get the king back again?";
B._2Sa19_13="And say to Amasa, Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God's punishment be on me, if I do not make you chief of the army before me at all times in place of Joab!";
B._2Sa19_14="And the hearts of the men of Judah were moved like one man; so that they sent to the king, saying, Come back, with all your servants.";
B._2Sa19_15="So the king came back, and came as far as Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, meeting the king there, to take him back with them over Jordan.";
B._2Sa19_16="And Shimei, the son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, got up quickly and went down with the men of Judah for the purpose of meeting King David;";
B._2Sa19_17="And with him a thousand men of Benjamin, and Ziba, the servant of Saul, with his fifteen sons and twenty servants, came rushing to Jordan before the king,";
B._2Sa19_18="And kept going across the river to take the people of the king's house over, and to do whatever was desired by the king. And Shimei, the son of Gera, went down on his face in the dust before the king, when he was about to go over Jordan,";
B._2Sa19_19="And said to him, Let me not be judged as a sinner in your eyes, O my lord, and do not keep in mind the wrong I did on the day when my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, or take it to heart.";
B._2Sa19_20="For your servant is conscious of his sin: and so, as you see, I have come today, the first of all the sons of Joseph, for the purpose of meeting my lord the king.";
B._2Sa19_21="But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said, Is not death the right fate for Shimei, because he has been cursing the one marked by the holy oil?";
B._2Sa19_22="And David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you put yourselves against me today? is it right for any man in Israel to be put to death today? for I am certain today that I am king in Israel.";
B._2Sa19_23="So the king said to Shimei, You will not be put to death. And the king gave him his oath.";
B._2Sa19_24="And Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son, came down for the purpose of meeting the king; his feet had not been cared for or his hair cut or his clothing washed from the day when the king went away till the day when he came back in peace.";
B._2Sa19_25="Now when he had come from Jerusalem to see the king, the king said to him, Why did you not come with me, Mephibosheth?";
B._2Sa19_26="And he said in answer, Because of the deceit of my servant, my lord king: for I, your servant, said to him, You are to make ready an ass and on it I will go with the king, for your servant has not the use of his feet.";
B._2Sa19_27="He has given you a false account of me: but my lord the king is like the angel of God: do then whatever seems good to you.";
B._2Sa19_28="For all my father's family were only dead men before my lord the king: and still you put your servant among those whose place is at the king's table. What right then have I to say anything more to the king?";
B._2Sa19_29="And the king said, Say nothing more about these things. I say, Let there be a division of the land between Ziba and you.";
B._2Sa19_30="And Mephibosheth said, Let him take it all, now that my lord the king has come back to his house in peace!";
B._2Sa19_31="And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went on as far as Jordan with the king to take him across Jordan.";
B._2Sa19_32="Now Barzillai was a very old man, as much as eighty years old: and he had given the king everything he had need of, while he was at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man.";
B._2Sa19_33="And the king said to Barzillai, Come over with me, and I will take care of you in Jerusalem.";
B._2Sa19_34="And Barzillai said to the king, How much of my life is still before me, for me to go up to Jerusalem with the king?";
B._2Sa19_35="I am now eighty years old: good and bad are the same to me; have meat and drink any taste for me now? am I able to take pleasure in the voices of men or women in song? why then am I to be a trouble to my lord the king?";
B._2Sa19_36="Your servant's desire was only to take the king over Jordan; why is the king to give me such a reward?";
B._2Sa19_37="Let your servant now go back again, so that when death comes to me, it may be in my town and by the resting-place of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham: let him go with my lord the king, and do for him what seems good to you.";
B._2Sa19_38="And the king said in answer, Let Chimham go over with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you: and whatever your desire is, I will do it for you.";
B._2Sa19_39="Then all the people went over Jordan, and the king went over: and the king gave Barzillai a kiss, with his blessing; and he went back to his place.";
B._2Sa19_40="So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went with him: and all the people of Judah, as well as half the people of Israel, took the king on his way.";
B._2Sa19_41="Then the men of Israel came to the king and said, Why have our countrymen of Judah taken you away in secret and come over Jordan with the king and all his family, because all his people are David's men?";
B._2Sa19_42="And all the men of Judah gave this answer to the men of Israel, Because the king is our near relation: why then are you angry about this? have we taken any of the king's food, or has he given us any offering?";
B._2Sa19_43="And in answer to the men of Judah, the men of Israel said, We have ten parts in the king, and we are the first in order of birth: why did you make nothing of us? and were we not the first to make suggestions for getting the king back? And the words of the men of Judah were more violent than the words of the men of Israel.";
B._2Sa20_1="Now by chance there was present a good-for-nothing person named Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he, sounding the horn, said, We have no part in David, or any interest in the son of Jesse: let every man go to his tent, O Israel.";
B._2Sa20_2="So all the men of Israel, turning away from David, went after Sheba, the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah were true to their king, going with him from Jordan as far as Jerusalem.";
B._2Sa20_3="And David came to his house at Jerusalem: and the king took the ten women to whom he had given the care of the house, and had them shut up, and gave them the necessaries of life, but did not go near them. So they were shut up till the day of their death, living as widows.";
B._2Sa20_4="Then the king said to Amasa, Get all the men of Judah together, and in three days be here yourself.";
B._2Sa20_5="So Amasa went to get all the men of Judah together, but he took longer than the time David had given him.";
B._2Sa20_6="And David said to Abishai, Sheba, the son of Bichri, will do us more damage than Absalom did; so take some of your lord's servants and go after him, before he makes himself safe in the walled towns, and gets away before our eyes.";
B._2Sa20_7="So there went after Abishai, Joab and the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the fighting-men; they went out of Jerusalem to overtake Sheba, the son of Bichri.";
B._2Sa20_8="When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came face to face with them. Now Joab had on his war-dress, and round him a band from which his sword was hanging in its cover; and while he was walking, it came out, falling to the earth.";
B._2Sa20_9="And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well, my brother? And with his right hand he took him by the hair of his chin to give him a kiss.";
B._2Sa20_10="But Amasa did not see danger from the sword which was now in Joab's left hand, and Joab put it through his stomach so that his inside came out on to the earth, and he did not give him another blow. So Joab and his brother Abishai went on after Sheba, the son of Bichri.";
B._2Sa20_11="And one of Joab's young men, taking his place at Amasa's side, said, Whoever is for Joab and for David, let him go after Joab!";
B._2Sa20_12="And Amasa was stretched out in a pool of blood in the middle of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people were stopping, he took Amasa out of the highway and put him in a field, with a cloth over him, when he saw that everyone who went by came to a stop.";
B._2Sa20_13="When he had been taken off the road, all the people went on after Joab in search of Sheba, the son of Bichri.";
B._2Sa20_14="And Sheba went through all the tribes of Israel, to Abel of Beth-maacah; and all the Bichrites came together and went in after him.";
B._2Sa20_15="And Joab and his men got him shut up in Abel of Beth-maacah, and put up an earthwork against the town: and all Joab's men did their best to get the wall broken down.";
B._2Sa20_16="Then a wise woman got up on the wall, and crying out from the town, said, Give ear, give ear; say now to Joab, Come near, so that I may have talk with you.";
B._2Sa20_17="And he came near, and the woman said, Are you Joab? And he said in answer, I am. Then she said, Give ear to your servant's words. And he said, I am giving ear.";
B._2Sa20_18="Then she said, In the old days, there was a saying, Let them put the question in Abel and in Dan, saying, Has what was ordered by men of good faith in Israel ever come to an end?";
B._2Sa20_19="Your purpose is the destruction of a mother-town in Israel: why would you put an end to the heritage of the Lord?";
B._2Sa20_20="And Joab, answering her, said, Far, far be it from me to be a cause of death or destruction;";
B._2Sa20_21="Not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba, son of Bichri, by name, has taken up arms against the king, against David: give up this man only, and I will go away from the town. And the woman said to Joab, His head will be dropped over the wall to you.";
B._2Sa20_22="Then the woman in her wisdom had talk with all the town. And they had Sheba's head cut off and sent out to Joab. And he had the horn sounded, and sent them all away from the town, every man to his tent. And Joab went back to Jerusalem to the king.";
B._2Sa20_23="Now Joab was over all the army; and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was at the head of the Cherethites and the Pelethites;";
B._2Sa20_24="And Adoram was overseer of the forced work; and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the recorder;";
B._2Sa20_25="And Sheva was the scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;";
B._2Sa20_26="And in addition, Ira the Jairite was a priest to David.";
B._2Sa21_1="In the days of David they were short of food for three years, year after year; and David went before the Lord for directions. And the Lord said, On Saul and on his family there is blood, because he put the Gibeonites to death.";
B._2Sa21_2="Then the king sent for the Gibeonites; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but were the last of the Amorites, to whom the children of Israel had given an oath; but Saul, in his passion for the children of Israel and Judah, had made an attempt on their lives:)";
B._2Sa21_3="So David said to the Gibeonites, What may I do for you? how am I to make up to you for your wrongs, so that you may give a blessing to the heritage of the Lord?";
B._2Sa21_4="And the Gibeonites said to him, It is not a question of silver and gold between us and Saul or his family; and it is not in our power to put to death any man in Israel. And he said, Say, then, what am I to do for you?";
B._2Sa21_5="And they said to the king, As for the man by whom we were wasted, and who made designs against us to have us completely cut off from the land of Israel,";
B._2Sa21_6="Let seven men of his family be given up to us and we will put an end to them by hanging them before the Lord in Gibeon, on the hill of the Lord. And the king said, I will give them.";
B._2Sa21_7="But the king did not give up Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son Jonathan, because of the Lord's oath made between David and Jonathan, the son of Saul.";
B._2Sa21_8="But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Saul to whom Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, had given birth; and the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab, whose father was Adriel, the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:";
B._2Sa21_9="And he gave them up to the Gibeonites, and they put them to death, hanging them on the mountain before the Lord; all seven came to their end together in the first days of the grain-cutting, at the start of the cutting of the barley.";
B._2Sa21_10="And Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, took haircloth, placing it on the rock as a bed for herself, from the start of the grain-cutting till rain came down on them from heaven; and she did not let the birds of the air come near them by day, or the beasts of the field by night.";
B._2Sa21_11="And news was given to David of what Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, one of Saul's wives, had done.";
B._2Sa21_12="And David went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had taken them away secretly from the public place of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had put them, hanging up the bodies there on the day when they put Saul to death in Gilboa:";
B._2Sa21_13="And he took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from that place; and they got together the bones of those who had been put to death by hanging.";
B._2Sa21_14="And they put them with the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the resting-place of Kish, his father, in Zela in the country of Benjamin; they did all the king had given them orders to do. And after that, God gave ear to their prayers for the land.";
B._2Sa21_15="And the Philistines went to war again with Israel; and David went down with his people, and while they were at Gob they had a fight with the Philistines:";
B._2Sa21_16="And there came against David one of the offspring of the Rephaim, whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, and having a new sword, he made an attempt to put David to death.";
B._2Sa21_17="But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, came to his help, and, turning on the Philistine, gave him his death-blow. Then David's men took an oath, and said, Never again are you to go out with us to the fight, so that you may not put out the light of Israel.";
B._2Sa21_18="Now after this there was war with the Philistines again at Gob, and Sibbecai the Hushathite put to death Saph, one of the offspring of the Rephaim.";
B._2Sa21_19="And again there was war with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan, the son of Jair the Beth-lehemite, put to death Goliath the Gittite, the stem of whose spear was like a cloth-worker's rod.";
B._2Sa21_20="And again there was war at Gath, where there was a very tall man, who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six fingers on his hands and six toes on his feet; he was one of the offspring of the Rephaim.";
B._2Sa21_21="And when he was purposing to put shame on Israel, Jonathan, the son of Shimei, David's brother, put him to death.";
B._2Sa21_22="These four were of the offspring of the Rephaim in Gath; and they came to their end by the hands of David and his servants.";
B._2Sa22_1="And David made a song to the Lord in these words, on the day when the Lord made him free from the hands of all his haters, and from the hand of Saul:";
B._2Sa22_2="And he said, The Lord is my Rock, my walled town, and my saviour, even mine;";
B._2Sa22_3="My God, my Rock, in him will I put my faith; my breastplate, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my safe place; my saviour, who keeps me safe from the violent man.";
B._2Sa22_4="I will send up my cry to the Lord, who is to be praised; so will I be made safe from those who are against me.";
B._2Sa22_5="For the waves of death came round me, and the seas of evil put me in fear;";
B._2Sa22_6="The cords of hell were round me: the nets of death came on me.";
B._2Sa22_7="In my trouble my voice went up to the Lord, and my cry to my God: my voice came to his hearing in his holy Temple, and my prayer came to his ears.";
B._2Sa22_8="Then the earth was moved with a violent shock; the bases of heaven were moved and shaking, because he was angry.";
B._2Sa22_9="There went up a smoke from his nose, and a fire of destruction from his mouth: coals were lighted by it.";
B._2Sa22_10="The heavens were bent, so that he might come down; and it was dark under his feet.";
B._2Sa22_11="And he went through the air, seated on a storm-cloud: going quickly on the wings of the wind.";
B._2Sa22_12="And he made the dark his tent round him, a mass of waters, thick clouds of the skies.";
B._2Sa22_13="Before his shining light his dark clouds went past, raining ice and coals of fire.";
B._2Sa22_14="The Lord made thunder in the heavens, and the voice of the Highest was sounding out.";
B._2Sa22_15="And he sent out his arrows, driving them in all directions; by his flames of fire they were troubled.";
B._2Sa22_16="Then the deep beds of the sea were seen, and the bases of the world were uncovered, because of the Lord's wrath, because of the breath of his mouth.";
B._2Sa22_17="He sent from on high, he took me, pulling me out of great waters.";
B._2Sa22_18="He made me free from my strong hater, from those who were against me, because they were stronger than I.";
B._2Sa22_19="They came on me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my support.";
B._2Sa22_20="He took me out into a wide place; he was my saviour because he had delight in me.";
B._2Sa22_21="The Lord gives me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean before him.";
B._2Sa22_22="For I have kept the ways of the Lord; I have not been turned away in sin from my God.";
B._2Sa22_23="For all his decisions were before me, and I did not put away his laws from me.";
B._2Sa22_24="And I was upright before him, and I kept myself from sin.";
B._2Sa22_25="Because of this the Lord has given me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean in his eyes.";
B._2Sa22_26="On him who has mercy you will have mercy; to the upright you will be upright;";
B._2Sa22_27="He who is holy will see that you are holy; but to the man whose way is not straight you will be a hard judge.";
B._2Sa22_28="For you are the saviour of those who are in trouble; but your eyes are on men of pride, to make them low.";
B._2Sa22_29="For you are my light, O Lord; and the Lord will make the dark bright for me.";
B._2Sa22_30="By your help I have made a way through the wall which was shutting me in: by the help of my God I have gone over a wall.";
B._2Sa22_31="As for God, his way is all good: the word of the Lord is tested; he is a safe cover for all those who put their faith in him.";
B._2Sa22_32="For who is God but the Lord? and who is a Rock but our God?";
B._2Sa22_33="God puts a strong band about me, guiding me in a straight way.";
B._2Sa22_34="He makes my feet like roes' feet, and puts me on high places.";
B._2Sa22_35="He makes my hands expert in war, so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms.";
B._2Sa22_36="You have given me the breastplate of your salvation, and your mercy has made me great.";
B._2Sa22_37="You have made my steps wide under me, so that my feet make no slip.";
B._2Sa22_38="I go after my haters and overtake them; not turning back till they are all overcome.";
B._2Sa22_39="I have sent destruction on them and given them wounds, so that they are not able to get up: they are stretched under my feet.";
B._2Sa22_40="For I have been armed by you with strength for the fight: you have made low under me those who came out against me.";
B._2Sa22_41="By you their backs are turned in flight, so that my haters are cut off.";
B._2Sa22_42="They were crying out, but there was no one to come to their help: even to the Lord, but he gave them no answer.";
B._2Sa22_43="Then they were crushed as small as the dust of the earth, stamped down under my feet like the waste of the streets.";
B._2Sa22_44="You have made me free from the fightings of my people; you have made me the head of the nations: a people of whom I had no knowledge will be my servants.";
B._2Sa22_45="Men of other countries will, with false hearts, put themselves under my authority: from the time when my name comes to their ears, they will be ruled by me.";
B._2Sa22_46="They will be wasted away, they will come out of their secret places shaking with fear.";
B._2Sa22_47="The Lord is living; praise be to my Rock, and let the God of my salvation be honoured:";
B._2Sa22_48="It is God who sends punishment on my haters, and puts peoples under my rule.";
B._2Sa22_49="He makes me free from my haters: I am lifted up over those who come up against me: you have made me free from the violent man.";
B._2Sa22_50="Because of this I will give you praise, O Lord, among the nations, and will make a song of praise to your name.";
B._2Sa22_51="Great salvation does he give to his king; he has mercy on the king of his selection, David, and on his seed for ever.";
B._2Sa23_1="Now these are the last words of David. David, the son of Jesse, says, the man who was lifted up on high, the man on whom the God of Jacob put the holy oil, the loved one of Israel's songs, says:";
B._2Sa23_2="The spirit of the Lord had voice through me, his word was on my tongue.";
B._2Sa23_3="The God of Israel said, the word of the Rock of Israel came to me: When an upright king is ruling over men, when he is ruling in the fear of God,";

B._2Sa23_5="For is not my house so with God? For he has made with me an eternal agreement, ordered in all things and certain: as for all my salvation and all my desire, will he not give it increase?";
B._2Sa23_6="But the evil-doers, all of them, will be like thorns to be pushed away, because they may not be gripped in the hand:";
B._2Sa23_7="But anyone touching them has to be armed with iron and the rod of a spear; and they will be burned with fire, every one of them.";
B._2Sa23_8="These are the names of David's men of war: Ishbaal the Hachmonite, chief of the three; his axe was lifted up against eight hundred put to death at one time.";
B._2Sa23_9="After him was Eleazar, the son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three great fighters, who was with David in Pas-dammim when the Philistines came together there for the fight; and when the men of Israel had gone in flight,";
B._2Sa23_10="He was with David and went on fighting the Philistines till his hand became tired and stiff from gripping his sword: and that day the Lord gave a great salvation, and the people came back after him only to take the goods of the Philistines.";
B._2Sa23_11="After him was Shammah, the son of Ela the Hararite. And the Philistines came together in Lehi, where there was a bit of land full of seed; and the people went in flight from the Philistines.";
B._2Sa23_12="But he kept his place in the middle of the bit of land, and kept back their attack and overcame the Philistines: and the Lord gave a great salvation.";
B._2Sa23_13="And three of the thirty went down at the start of the grain-cutting, and they came to David at the strong place of Adullam; and the band of Philistines had taken up their position in the valley of Rephaim.";
B._2Sa23_14="And at that time David had taken cover in the strong place, and an armed force of the Philistines was in Beth-lehem.";
B._2Sa23_15="And David, moved by a strong desire, said, If only someone would give me a drink of water from the water-hole of Beth-lehem, by the doorway into the town!";
B._2Sa23_16="And the three men, forcing their way through the Philistine army, got water from the water-hole of Beth-lehem, by the doorway into the town, and took it back to David: but he would not take it, but, draining it out, made an offering of it to the Lord.";
B._2Sa23_17="And he said, Far be it from me, O Lord, to do this; how may I take as my drink the life-blood of men who have put their lives in danger? So he would not take it. These things did the three great men of war.";
B._2Sa23_18="And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty. He put to death three hundred with his spear, and he got for himself a name among the thirty.";
