B._Jer28_4="And I will let Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, come back to this place, with all the prisoners of Judah who went to Babylon, says the Lord: for I will have the yoke of the king of Babylon broken.";
B._Jer28_5="Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, before the priests and all the people who had come into the house of the Lord,";
B._Jer28_6="The prophet Jeremiah said, So be it: may the Lord do so: may the Lord give effect to the words which you have said, and let the vessels of the Lord's house, and all the people who have been taken away, come back from Babylon to this place.";
B._Jer28_7="But still, give ear to this word which I am saying to you and to all the people:";
B._Jer28_8="The prophets, who were before me and before you, from early times gave word to a number of countries and great kingdoms about war and destruction and disease.";
B._Jer28_9="The prophet whose words are of peace, when his words come true, will be seen to be a prophet whom the Lord has sent.";
B._Jer28_10="Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and it was broken by his hands.";
B._Jer28_11="And before all the people Hananiah said, The Lord has said, Even so will I let the yoke of the king of Babylon be broken off the necks of all the nations in the space of two years. Then the prophet Jeremiah went away.";
B._Jer28_12="Then after the yoke had been broken off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah by Hananiah the prophet, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,";
B._Jer28_13="Go and say to Hananiah, This is what the Lord has said: Yokes of wood have been broken by you, but in their place I will make yokes of iron.";
B._Jer28_14="For the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: I have put a yoke of iron on the necks of all these nations, making them servants to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon; and they are to be his servants: and in addition I have given him the beasts of the field.";
B._Jer28_15="Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, Give ear, now, Hananiah; the Lord has not sent you; but you are making this people put their faith in what is false.";
B._Jer28_16="For this reason the Lord has said, See, I will send you away from off the face of the earth: this year death will overtake you, because you have said words against the Lord.";
B._Jer28_17="So death came to Hananiah the prophet the same year, in the seventh month.";
B._Jer29_1="Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the responsible men among those who had been taken away, and to the priests and the prophets and to all the rest of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken away prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylon;";
B._Jer29_2="(After Jeconiah the king and the queen-mother and the unsexed servants and the rulers of Judah and Jerusalem and the expert workmen and the metal-workers had gone away from Jerusalem;)";
B._Jer29_3="By the hand of Elasah, the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah, the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah, king of Judah, sent to Babylon, to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,) saying,";
B._Jer29_4="This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said to all those whom I have taken away prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylon:";
B._Jer29_5="Go on building houses and living in them, and planting gardens and using the fruit of them;";
B._Jer29_6="Take wives and have sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may have sons and daughters; and be increased in number there and do not become less.";
B._Jer29_7="And be working for the peace of the land to which I have had you taken away prisoners, and make prayer to the Lord for it: for in its peace you will have peace.";
B._Jer29_8="For this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: Do not let yourselves be tricked by the prophets who are among you, and the readers of signs, and give no attention to their dreams which they may have;";
B._Jer29_9="For they are saying to you what is false in my name: I have not sent them, says the Lord.";
B._Jer29_10="For this is what the Lord has said: When seventy years are ended for Babylon, I will have pity on you and give effect to my good purpose for you, causing you to come back to this place.";
B._Jer29_11="For I am conscious of my thoughts about you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you hope at the end.";
B._Jer29_12="And you will go on crying to me and making prayer to me, and I will give ear to you.";
B._Jer29_13="And you will be searching for me and I will be there, when you have gone after me with all your heart.";
B._Jer29_14="I will be near you again, says the Lord, and your fate will be changed, and I will get you together from all the nations and from all the places where I had sent you away, says the Lord; and I will take you back again to the place from which I sent you away prisoners.";
B._Jer29_15="For you have said, The Lord has given us prophets in Babylon.";
B._Jer29_16="For this is what the Lord has said about the king who is seated on the seat of David's kingdom, and about all the people living in this town, your countrymen who have not gone out with you as prisoners;";
B._Jer29_17="This is what the Lord of armies has said: See, I will send on them the sword and need of food and disease, and will make them like bad figs, which are of no use for food, they are so bad.";
B._Jer29_18="I will go after them, attacking them with the sword and with need of food and with disease, and will make them a cause of fear to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse and a wonder and a surprise and a name of shame among all the nations where I have sent them:";
B._Jer29_19="Because they have not given ear to my words, says the Lord, when I sent to them my servants the prophets, getting up early and sending them; but you did not give ear, says the Lord.";
B._Jer29_20="And now, give ear to the word of the Lord, all you whom I have sent away prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylon.";
B._Jer29_21="This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said about Ahab, the son of Kolaiah, and about Zedekiah, the son of Maaseiah, who are saying to you what is false in my name: See, I will give them up into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and he will put them to death before your eyes.";
B._Jer29_22="And their fate will be used as a curse by all the prisoners of Judah who are in Babylon, who will say, May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, who were burned in the fire by the king of Babylon;";
B._Jer29_23="Because they have done shame in Israel, and have taken their neighbours' wives, and in my name have said false words, which I did not give them orders to say; and I myself am the witness, says the Lord.";
B._Jer29_24="About Shemaiah the Nehelamite.";
B._Jer29_25="Shemaiah the Nehelamite sent a letter in his name to Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,";
B._Jer29_26="The Lord has made you priest in place of Jehoiada the priest, to be an overseer in the house of the Lord for every man who is off his head and is acting as a prophet, to put such men in prison and in chains.";
B._Jer29_27="So why have you made no protest against Jeremiah of Anathoth, who is acting as a prophet to you?";
B._Jer29_28="For he has sent to us in Babylon saying, The time will be long: go on building houses and living in them, and planting gardens and using the fruit of them.";
B._Jer29_29="And Zephaniah the priest made clear to Jeremiah the prophet what was said in the letter, reading it to him.";
B._Jer29_30="Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,";
B._Jer29_31="Send to all those who have been taken away, saying, This is what the Lord has said about Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has been acting as a prophet to you, and I did not send him, and has made you put your faith in what is false;";

B._Jer30_1="The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,";
B._Jer30_2="The Lord, the God of Israel, has said, Put down in a book all the words which I have said to you.";
B._Jer30_3="For see, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will let the fate of my people Israel and Judah be changed, says the Lord: and I will make them come back to the land which I gave to their fathers, so that they may take it for their heritage.";
B._Jer30_4="And these are the words which the Lord said about Israel and about Judah.";
B._Jer30_5="This is what the Lord has said: A voice of shaking fear has come to our ears, of fear and not of peace.";
B._Jer30_6="Put the question and see if it is possible for a man to have birth-pains: why do I see every man with his hands gripping his sides, as a woman does when the pains of birth are on her, and all faces are turned green?";
B._Jer30_7="Ha! for that day is so great that there is no day like it: it is the time of Jacob's trouble: but he will get salvation from it.";
B._Jer30_8="For it will come about on that day, says the Lord of armies, that his yoke will be broken off his neck, and his bands will be burst; and men of strange lands will no longer make use of him as their servant:";
B._Jer30_9="But they will be servants to the Lord their God and to David their king, whom I will give back to them.";
B._Jer30_10="So have no fear, O Jacob, my servant, says the Lord; and do not be troubled, O Israel: for see, I will make you come back from far away, and your seed from the land where they are prisoners; and Jacob will come back, and will be quiet and at peace, and no one will give him cause for fear.";
B._Jer30_11="For I am with you, says the Lord, to be your saviour: for I will put an end to all the nations where I have sent you wandering, but I will not put an end to you completely: though with wise purpose I will put right your errors, and will not let you go quite without punishment.";

B._Jer30_13="There is no help for your wound, there is nothing to make you well.";
B._Jer30_14="Your lovers have no more thought for you, they go after you no longer; for I have given you the wound of a hater, even cruel punishment;";
B._Jer30_15="Why are you crying for help because of your wound? for your pain may never be taken away: because your evil-doing was so great and because your sins were increased, I have done these things to you.";
B._Jer30_16="For this cause, all those who take you for their food will themselves become your food; and all your attackers, every one of them, will be taken prisoners; and those who send destruction on you will come to destruction; and all those who take away your goods by force will undergo the same themselves.";
B._Jer30_17="For I will make you healthy again and I will make you well from your wounds, says the Lord; because they have given you the name of an outlaw, saying, It is Zion cared for by no man.";
B._Jer30_18="The Lord has said, See, I am changing the fate of the tents of Jacob, and I will have pity on his houses; the town will be put up on its hill, and the great houses will be living-places again.";

B._Jer30_20="And their children will be as they were in the old days, and the meeting of the people will have its place before me, and I will send punishment on all who are cruel to them.";
B._Jer30_21="And their chief will be of their number; their ruler will come from among themselves; and I will let him be present before me, so that he may come near to me: for who may have strength of heart to come near me? says the Lord.";
B._Jer30_22="And you will be my people, and I will be your God.";
B._Jer30_23="See, the storm-wind of the Lord, even the heat of his wrath, has gone out, a rolling storm, bursting on the heads of the evil-doers.";
B._Jer30_24="The wrath of the Lord will not be turned back till he has done, till he has put into effect, the purposes of his heart: in days to come you will have full knowledge of this.";

B._Jer31_3="From far away he saw the Lord: my love for you is an eternal love: so with mercy I have made you come with me.";
B._Jer31_4="I will again make new your buildings, O virgin of Israel, and you will take up your place: again you will take up your instruments of music, and go out in the dances of those who are glad.";
B._Jer31_5="Again will your vine-gardens be planted on the hill of Samaria: the planters will be planting and using the fruit.";
B._Jer31_6="For there will be a day when those who get in the grapes on the hills of Ephraim will be crying, Up! let us go up to Zion to the Lord our God.";
B._Jer31_7="For the Lord has said, Make a glad song for Jacob and give a cry on the top of the mountains: give the news, give praise, and say, The Lord has given salvation to his people, even to the rest of Israel.";
B._Jer31_8="See, I will take them from the north country, and get them from the inmost parts of the earth, and with them the blind and the feeble-footed, the woman with child and her who is in birth-pains together: a very great army, they will come back here.";
B._Jer31_9="They will come with weeping, and going before them I will be their guide: guiding them by streams of water in a straight way where there is no falling: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is the first of my sons.";
B._Jer31_10="Give ear to the word of the Lord, O you nations, and give news of it in the sea-lands far away, and say, He who has sent Israel wandering will get him together and will keep him as a keeper does his flock.";
B._Jer31_11="For the Lord has given a price for Jacob, and made him free from the hands of him who was stronger than he.";
B._Jer31_12="So they will come with songs on the high places, flowing together to the good things of the Lord, to the grain and the wine and the oil, to the young ones of the flock and of the herd: their souls will be like a watered garden, and they will have no more sorrow.";
B._Jer31_13="Then the virgin will have joy in the dance, and the young men and the old will be glad: for I will have their weeping turned into joy, I will give them comfort and make them glad after their sorrow.";
B._Jer31_14="I will give the priests their desired fat things, and my people will have a full measure of my good things, says the Lord.";
B._Jer31_15="So has the Lord said: In Ramah there is a sound of crying, weeping and bitter sorrow; Rachel weeping for her children; she will not be comforted for their loss.";
B._Jer31_16="The Lord has said this: Keep your voice from sorrow and your eyes from weeping: for your work will be rewarded, says the Lord; and they will come back from the land of their hater.";
B._Jer31_17="And there is hope for the future, says the Lord; and your children will come back to the land which is theirs.";
B._Jer31_18="Certainly Ephraim's words of grief have come to my ears, You have given me training and I have undergone it like a young cow unused to the yoke: let me be turned and come back, for you are the Lord my God.";
B._Jer31_19="Truly, after I had been turned, I had regret for my ways; and after I had got knowledge, I made signs of sorrow: I was put to shame, truly, I was covered with shame, because I had to undergo the shame of my early years.";
B._Jer31_20="Is Ephraim my dear son? is he the child of my delight? for whenever I say things against him, I still keep him in my memory: so my heart is troubled for him; I will certainly have mercy on him, says the Lord.";
B._Jer31_21="Put up guiding pillars, make road signs for yourself: give attention to the highway, even the way in which you went: be turned again, O virgin of Israel, be turned to these your towns.";
B._Jer31_22="How long will you go on turning this way and that, O wandering daughter? for the Lord has made a new thing on the earth, a woman changed into a man.";
B._Jer31_23="So the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said, Again will these words be used in the land of Judah and in its towns, when I have let their fate be changed: May the blessing of the Lord be on you, O resting-place of righteousness, O holy mountain.";
B._Jer31_24="And Judah and all its towns will be living there together; the farmers and those who go about with flocks.";
B._Jer31_25="For I have given new strength to the tired soul and to every sorrowing soul in full measure.";
B._Jer31_26="At this, awaking from my sleep, I saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.";
B._Jer31_27="See, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will have Israel and Judah planted with the seed of man and with the seed of beast.";
B._Jer31_28="And it will come about that, as I have been watching over them for the purpose of uprooting and smashing down and overturning and sending destruction and causing trouble; so I will be watching over them for the purpose of building up and planting, says the Lord.";
B._Jer31_29="In those days they will no longer say, The fathers have been tasting bitter grapes and the children's teeth are put on edge.";
B._Jer31_30="But everyone will be put to death for the evil which he himself has done: whoever has taken bitter grapes will himself have his teeth put on edge.";
B._Jer31_31="See, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah:";
B._Jer31_32="Not like the agreement which I made with their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to be their guide out of the land of Egypt; which agreement was broken by them, and I gave them up, says the Lord.";
B._Jer31_33="But this is the agreement which I will make with the people of Israel after those days, says the Lord; I will put my law in their inner parts, writing it in their hearts; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.";
B._Jer31_34="And no longer will they be teaching every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, Get knowledge of the Lord: for they will all have knowledge of me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says the Lord: for they will have my forgiveness for their evil-doing, and their sin will go from my memory for ever.";
B._Jer31_35="These are the words of the Lord, who has given the sun for a light by day, ordering the moon and stars for a light by night, who puts the sea in motion, causing the thunder of its waves; the Lord of armies is his name.";
B._Jer31_36="If the order of these things before me is ever broken, says the Lord, then will the seed of Israel come to an end as a nation before me for ever.";
B._Jer31_37="This is what the Lord has said: If the heavens on high may be measured, and the bases of the earth searched out, then I will give up the seed of Israel, because of all they have done, says the Lord.";
B._Jer31_38="See, the days are coming, says the Lord, for the building of the Lord's town, from the tower of Hananel to the doorway of the angle.";
B._Jer31_39="And the measuring-line will go out in front of it as far as the hill Gareb, going round to Goah.";
B._Jer31_40="And all the valley of the dead bodies, and all the field of death as far as the stream Kidron, up to the angle of the horses' doorway to the east, will be holy to the Lord; it will not again be uprooted or overturned for ever.";
B._Jer32_1="The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.";
B._Jer32_2="Now at that time the king of Babylon's army was round Jerusalem, shutting it in: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the place of the armed watchmen, in the house of the king of Judah.";
B._Jer32_3="For Zedekiah, king of Judah, had had him shut up, saying, Why have you, as a prophet, been saying, The Lord has said, See, I will give this town into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will take it;";
B._Jer32_4="And Zedekiah, king of Judah, will not get away from the hands of the Chaldaeans, but will certainly be given up into the hands of the king of Babylon, and will have talk with him, mouth to mouth, and see him, eye to eye.";
B._Jer32_5="And he will take Zedekiah away to Babylon, where he will be till I have pity on him, says the Lord: though you are fighting with the Chaldaeans, things will not go well for you?";
B._Jer32_6="And Jeremiah said, The word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Jer32_7="See, Hanamel, the son of Shallum, your father's brother, will come to you and say, Give the price and get for yourself my property in Anathoth: for you have the right of the nearest relation.";
B._Jer32_8="So Hanamel, the son of my father's brother, came to me, as the Lord had said, to the place of the armed watchmen, and said to me, Give the price and get my property which is in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: for you have the nearest relation's right to the heritage; so get it for yourself. Then it was clear to me that this was the word of the Lord.";
B._Jer32_9="So I got for a price the property in Anathoth from Hanamel, the son of my father's brother, and gave him the money, seventeen shekels of silver;";
B._Jer32_10="And I put it in writing, stamping it with my stamp, and I took witnesses and put the money into the scales.";
B._Jer32_11="So I took the paper witnessing the business, one copy rolled up and stamped, and one copy open:";
B._Jer32_12="And I gave the paper to Baruch, the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, before the eyes of Hanamel, the son of my father's brother, and of the witnesses who had put their names to the paper, and before all the Jews who were seated in the place of the armed watchmen.";
B._Jer32_13="And I gave orders to Baruch in front of them, saying,";
B._Jer32_14="This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: Take these papers, the witness of this business, the one which is rolled up and stamped, and the one which is open; and put them in a vessel of earth so that they may be kept for a long time.";
B._Jer32_15="For the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said, There will again be trading in houses and fields and vine-gardens in this land.";
B._Jer32_16="Now after I had given the paper to Baruch, the son of Neriah, I made my prayer to the Lord, saying,";
B._Jer32_17="Ah Lord God! see, you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm, and there is nothing you are not able to do:";
B._Jer32_18="You have mercy on thousands, and send punishment for the evil-doing of the fathers on their children after them: the great, the strong God, the Lord of armies is his name:";
B._Jer32_19="Great in wisdom and strong in act: whose eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of men, giving to everyone the reward of his ways and the fruit of his doings:";
B._Jer32_20="You have done signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and even to this day, in Israel and among other men; and have made a name for yourself as at this day;";
B._Jer32_21="And have taken your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, causing great fear;";
B._Jer32_22="And have given them this land, which you gave your word to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;";
B._Jer32_23="And they came in and took it for their heritage, but they did not give ear to your voice, and were not ruled by your law; they have done nothing of all you gave them orders to do: so you have made all this evil come on them:";
B._Jer32_24="See, they have made earthworks against the town to take it; and the town is given into the hands of the Chaldaeans who are fighting against it, because of the sword and need of food and disease: and what you have said has taken place, and truly you see it.";
B._Jer32_25="And you have said to me, Give the money to get yourself a property, and have the business witnessed; though the town is given into the hands of the Chaldaeans.";
B._Jer32_26="And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,";
B._Jer32_27="See, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: is there anything so hard that I am unable to do it?";
B._Jer32_28="So this is what the Lord has said: See, I am giving this town into the hands of the Chaldaeans and into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, and he will take it:";
B._Jer32_29="And the Chaldaeans, who are fighting against this town, will come and put the town on fire, burning it together with the houses, on the roofs of which perfumes have been burned to the Baal, and drink offerings have been drained out to other gods, moving me to wrath.";
