B._Isa66_2="For all these things my hand has made, and they are mine, says the Lord; but to this man only will I give attention, to him who is poor and broken in spirit, fearing my word.";
B._Isa66_3="He who puts an ox to death puts a man to death; he who makes an offering of a lamb puts a dog to death; he who makes a meal offering makes an offering of pig's blood; he who makes an offering of perfumes for a sign gives worship to an image: as they have gone after their desires, and their soul takes pleasure in their disgusting things;";
B._Isa66_4="So I will go after trouble for them, and will send on them what they are fearing: because no one made answer to my voice, or gave ear to my word; but they did what was evil in my eyes, going after that in which I took no pleasure.";
B._Isa66_5="Give ear to the word of the Lord, you who are in fear at his word: your countrymen, hating you, and driving you out because of my name, have said, Let the Lord's glory be made clear, so that we may see your joy; but they will be put to shame.";
B._Isa66_6="There is a noise of war from the town, a sound from the Temple, the voice of the Lord giving punishment to his haters.";
B._Isa66_7="Before her pains came, she gave birth; before her pains, she gave birth to a man-child.";
B._Isa66_8="When has such a story come to men's ears? who has seen such things? will a land come to birth in one day? will a nation be given birth in a minute? For when Zion's pains came on her, she gave birth to her children straight away.";
B._Isa66_9="Will I by whom the birth was started, not make it complete? says the Lord. Will I who make children come to birth, let them be kept back? says your God.";
B._Isa66_10="Have joy with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you her lovers: take part in her joy, all you who are sorrowing for her:";
B._Isa66_11="So that you may take of the comfort flowing from her breasts, and be delighted with the full measure of her glory.";
B._Isa66_12="For the Lord says, See, I will make her peace like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream, and she will take her children in her arms, gently caring for them on her knees.";
B._Isa66_13="As to one who is comforted by his mother, so will I give you comfort: and you will be comforted in Jerusalem.";
B._Isa66_14="And you will see it and your heart will be glad, and your bones will get new strength, like young grass: and the hand of the Lord will be seen at work for his servants, and his wrath against his haters.";
B._Isa66_15="For the Lord is coming with fire, and his war-carriages will be like the storm-wind; to give punishment in the heat of his wrath, and his passion is like flames of fire.";
B._Isa66_16="For with fire and sword will the Lord come, judging all the earth, and his sword will be on all flesh: and great numbers will be put to death by him.";
B._Isa66_17="As for those who keep themselves separate, and make themselves clean in the gardens, going after one in the middle, taking pig's flesh for food, and other disgusting things, such as the mouse: their works and their thoughts will come to an end together, says the Lord.";
B._Isa66_18="And I am coming to get together all nations and tongues: and they will come and will see my glory.";
B._Isa66_19="And I will put a sign among them, and I will send those who are still living to the nations, to Tarshish, Put, and Lud, Meshech and Rosh, Tubal and Javan, to the sea-lands far away, who have not had word of me, or seen my glory; and they will give the knowledge of my glory to the nations.";
B._Isa66_20="And they will take your countrymen out of all the nations for an offering to the Lord, on horses, and in carriages, and in carts, and on asses, and on camels, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the Lord, as the children of Israel take their offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord.";
B._Isa66_21="And some of them will I take for priests and Levites, says the Lord.";
B._Isa66_22="For as the new heaven and the new earth which I will make will be for ever before me, says the Lord, so will your seed and your name be for ever.";
B._Isa66_23="And it will be, that from new moon to new moon, and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh will come to give worship before me, says the Lord.";
B._Isa66_24="And they will go out to see the dead bodies of the men who have done evil against me: for their worm will ever be living, and their fire will never be put out, and they will be a thing of fear to all flesh.";
B._Jer1_1="The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:";
B._Jer1_2="To whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his rule.";
B._Jer1_3="And it came again in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, up to the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah; till Jerusalem was taken away in the fifth month.";
B._Jer1_4="Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Jer1_5="Before you were formed in the body of your mother I had knowledge of you, and before your birth I made you holy; I have given you the work of being a prophet to the nations.";
B._Jer1_6="Then said I, O Lord God! see, I have no power of words, for I am a child.";
B._Jer1_7="But the Lord said to me, Do not say, I am a child: for wherever I send you, you are to go, and whatever I give you orders to say, you are to say.";
B._Jer1_8="Have no fear because of them: for I am with you, to keep you safe, says the Lord.";
B._Jer1_9="Then the Lord put out his hand, touching my mouth; and the Lord said to me, See, I have put my words in your mouth:";
B._Jer1_10="See, this day I have put you over the nations and over the kingdoms, for uprooting and smashing down, for destruction and overturning, for building up and planting.";
B._Jer1_11="Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what do you see? And I said, I see a branch of an almond-tree.";
B._Jer1_12="Then the Lord said to me, You have seen well: for I keep watch over my word to give effect to it.";
B._Jer1_13="And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying, What do you see? And I said, I see a boiling pot, and its face is from the north.";
B._Jer1_14="Then the Lord said to me, Out of the north evil will come, bursting out on all the people of the land.";
B._Jer1_15="For see, I will send for all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says the Lord; and they will come, everyone placing his high seat at the way into Jerusalem, and against its walls on every side, and against all the towns of Judah.";
B._Jer1_16="And I will give my decision against them on account of all their evil-doing; because they have given me up, burning perfumes to other gods and worshipping the works of their hands.";
B._Jer1_17="So make yourself ready, and go and say to them everything I give you orders to say: do not be overcome by fear of them, or I will send fear on you before them.";
B._Jer1_18="For see, this day have I made you a walled town, and an iron pillar, and walls of brass, against all the land, against the kings of Judah, against its captains, against its priests, and against the people of the land.";
B._Jer1_19="They will be fighting against you, but they will not overcome you: for I am with you, says the Lord, to give you salvation.";
B._Jer2_1="And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,";
B._Jer2_2="Go and say in the ears of Jerusalem, The Lord says, I still keep the memory of your kind heart when you were young, and your love when you became my bride; how you went after me in the waste of sand, in an unplanted land.";
B._Jer2_3="Israel was holy to the Lord, the first-fruits of his increase: all who made attacks on him were judged as wrongdoers, evil came on them, says the Lord.";
B._Jer2_4="Give ear to the words of the Lord, O sons of Jacob and all the families of Israel:";
B._Jer2_5="These are the words of the Lord: What evil have your fathers seen in me that they have gone far from me, and, walking after what is false, have become false?";
B._Jer2_6="And they never said, Where is the Lord, who took us up out of the land of Egypt; who was our guide through the waste of sand, through an unplanted land full of deep holes, through a dry land of deep shade, which no one went through and where no man was living?";
B._Jer2_7="And I took you into a fertile land, where you were living on its fruit and its wealth; but when you came in, you made my land unclean, and made my heritage a disgusting thing.";
B._Jer2_8="The priests did not say, Where is the Lord? and those who were expert in the law had no knowledge of me: and the rulers did evil against me, and the prophets became prophets of the Baal, going after things without value.";
B._Jer2_9="For this reason, I will again put forward my cause against you, says the Lord, even against you and against your children's children.";
B._Jer2_10="For go over to the sea-lands of Kittim and see; send to Kedar and give deep thought to it; and see if there has ever been such a thing.";
B._Jer2_11="Has any nation ever made a change in their gods, though they are no gods? but my people have given up their glory in exchange for what is of no profit.";
B._Jer2_12="Be full of wonder, O heavens, at this; be overcome with fear, be completely waste, says the Lord.";
B._Jer2_13="For my people have done two evils; they have given up me, the fountain of living waters, and have made for themselves water-holes, cut out from the rock, broken water-holes, of no use for storing water.";
B._Jer2_14="Is Israel a servant? has he been a house-servant from birth? why has he been made waste?";
B._Jer2_15="The young lions have made an outcry against him with a loud voice: they have made his land waste; his towns are burned up, with no one living in them.";
B._Jer2_16="Even the children of Noph and Tahpanhes have put shame on you.";
B._Jer2_17="Has not this come on you because you have given up the Lord your God, who was your guide by the way?";
B._Jer2_18="And now, what have you to do on the way to Egypt, to get your drink from the waters of the Nile? or what have you to do on the way to Assyria, to get your drink from the waters of the River?";
B._Jer2_19="The evil you yourselves have done will be your punishment, your errors will be your judge: be certain then, and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing to give up the Lord your God, and no longer to be moved by fear of me, says the Lord, the Lord of armies.";
B._Jer2_20="For in the past, your yoke was broken by your hands and your cords parted; and you said, I will not be your servant; for on every high hill and under every branching tree, your behaviour was like that of a loose woman";
B._Jer2_21="But when you were planted by me, you were a noble vine, in every way a true seed: how then have you been changed into the branching plant of a strange vine?";
B._Jer2_22="For even if you are washed with soda and take much soap, still your evil-doing is marked before me, says the Lord God.";
B._Jer2_23="How are you able to say, I am not unclean, I have not gone after the Baals? see your way in the valley, be clear about what you have done: you are a quick-footed camel twisting her way in and out;";
B._Jer2_24="An untrained ass, used to the waste land, breathing up the wind in her desire; at her time, who is able to send her away? all those who are looking for her will have no need to make themselves tired; in her month they will get her.";
B._Jer2_25="Do not let your foot be without shoes, or your throat dry from need of water: but you said, There is no hope: no, for I have been a lover of strange gods, and after them I will go.";
B._Jer2_26="As the thief is shamed when he is taken, so is Israel shamed; they, their kings and their rulers, their priests and their prophets;";
B._Jer2_27="Who say to a tree, You are my father; and to a stone, You have given me life: for their backs have been turned to me, not their faces: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Up! and be our saviour.";
B._Jer2_28="But where are the gods you have made for yourselves? let them come, if they are able to give you salvation in the time of your trouble: for the number of your gods is as the number of your towns, O Judah.";
B._Jer2_29="Why will you put forward your cause against me? You have all done evil against me, says the Lord.";
B._Jer2_30="I gave your children blows to no purpose; they got no good from training: your sword has been the destruction of your prophets, like a death-giving lion.";
B._Jer2_31="O generation, see the word of the Lord. Have I been a waste land to Israel? or a land of dark night? why do my people say, We have got loose, we will not come to you again?";
B._Jer2_32="Is it possible for a virgin to put out of her memory her ornaments, or a bride her robes? but my people have put me out of their memories for unnumbered days.";
B._Jer2_33="With what care are your ways ordered when you are looking for love! so ... your ways.";
B._Jer2_34="And in the skirts of your robe may be seen the life-blood of those who have done no wrong: ...";
B._Jer2_35="And still you said, I have done no wrong; truly, his wrath is turned away from me. See, I will take up the cause against you, because you say, I have done no wrong.";
B._Jer2_36="Why do you go about so much for the purpose of changing your way? you will be shamed on account of Egypt, as you were shamed on account of Assyria.";
B._Jer2_37="Truly, you will go out from him with your hands on your head: for the Lord has given up those in whom you have put your faith, and they will be of no help to you.";
B._Jer3_1="They say, If a man puts away his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man's, will he go back to her again? will not that land have been made unclean? but though you have been acting like a loose woman with a number of lovers, will you now come back to me? says the Lord.";
B._Jer3_2="Let your eyes be lifted up to the open hilltops, and see; where have you not been taken by your lovers? You have been seated waiting for them by the wayside like an Arabian in the waste land; you have made the land unclean with your loose ways and your evil-doing.";
B._Jer3_3="So the showers have been kept back, and there has been no spring rain; still your brow is the brow of a loose woman, you will not let yourself be shamed.";
B._Jer3_4="Will you not, from this time, make your prayer to me, crying, My father, you are the friend of my early years?";
B._Jer3_5="Will he be angry for ever? will he keep his wrath to the end? These things you have said, and have done evil and have had your way.";
B._Jer3_6="And the Lord said to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen what Israel, turning away from me, has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every branching tree, acting like a loose woman there.";
B._Jer3_7="And I said, After she has done all these things she will come back to me; but she did not. And her false sister Judah saw it.";
B._Jer3_8="And though she saw that, because Israel, turning away from me, had been untrue to me, I had put her away and given her a statement in writing ending the relation between us, still Judah, her false sister, had no fear, but went and did the same.";
B._Jer3_9="So that through all her loose behaviour the land became unclean, and she was untrue, giving herself to stones and trees.";
B._Jer3_10="But for all this, her false sister Judah has not come back to me with all her heart, but with deceit, says the Lord.";
B._Jer3_11="And the Lord said to me, Israel in her turning away is seen to be more upright than false Judah.";
B._Jer3_12="Go, and give out these words to the north, and say, Come back, O Israel, though you have been turned away from me, says the Lord; my face will not be against you in wrath: for I am full of mercy, says the Lord, I will not be angry for ever.";
B._Jer3_13="Only be conscious of your sin, the evil you have done against the Lord your God; you have gone with strange men under every branching tree, giving no attention to my voice, says the Lord.";
B._Jer3_14="Come back, O children who are turned away, says the Lord; for I am a husband to you, and I will take you, one from a town and two from a family, and will make you come to Zion;";
B._Jer3_15="And I will give you keepers, pleasing to my heart, who will give you your food with knowledge and wisdom.";
B._Jer3_16="And it will come about, when your numbers are increased in the land, in those days, says the Lord, that they will no longer say, The ark of the agreement of the Lord: it will not come into their minds, they will not have any memory of it, or be conscious of the loss of it, and it will not be made again.";
B._Jer3_17="At that time Jerusalem will be named the seat of the Lord's kingdom; and all the nations will come together to it, to the name of the Lord, to Jerusalem: and no longer will their steps be guided by the purposes of their evil hearts.";
B._Jer3_18="In those days the family of Judah will go with the family of Israel, and they will come together out of the land of the north into the land which I gave for a heritage to your fathers.";
B._Jer3_19="But I said, How am I to put you among the children, and give you a desired land, a heritage of glory among the armies of the nations? and I said, You are to say to me, My father; and not be turned away from me.";
B._Jer3_20="Truly, as a wife is false to her husband, so have you been false to me, O Israel, says the Lord.";
B._Jer3_21="A voice is sounding on the open hilltops, the weeping and the prayers of the children of Israel; because their way is twisted, they have not kept the Lord their God in mind.";
B._Jer3_22="Come back, you children who have been turned away, and I will take away your desire for wandering. See, we have come to you, for you are the Lord our God.";
B._Jer3_23="Truly, the hills, and the noise of an army on the mountains, are a false hope: truly, in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.";
B._Jer3_24="But the Baal has taken all the work of our fathers from our earliest days; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.";
B._Jer3_25="Let us be stretched on the earth in our downfall, covering ourselves with our shame: for we have been sinners against the Lord our God, we and our fathers, from our earliest years even till this day: and we have not given ear to the voice of the Lord our God.";
B._Jer4_1="If you will come back, O Israel, says the Lord, you will come back to me: and if you will put away your disgusting ways, you will not be sent away from before me.";
B._Jer4_2="And you will take your oath, By the living Lord, in good faith and wisdom and righteousness; and the nations will make use of you as a blessing, and in you will they take a pride.";
B._Jer4_3="For this is what the Lord says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem: Get your unworked land ploughed up, do not put in your seeds among thorns.";
B._Jer4_4="Undergo a circumcision of the heart, you men of Judah and people of Jerusalem: or my wrath may come out like fire, burning so that no one is able to put it out, because of the evil of your doings.";
B._Jer4_5="Say openly in Judah, give it out in Jerusalem, and say, Let the horn be sounded in the land: crying out in a loud voice, Come together, and let us go into the walled towns.";
B._Jer4_6="Put up a flag for a sign to Zion: go in flight so that you may be safe, waiting no longer: for I will send evil from the north, and a great destruction.";
B._Jer4_7="A lion has gone up from his secret place in the woods, and one who makes waste the nations is on his way; he has gone out from his place, to make your land unpeopled, so that your towns will be made waste, with no man living in them.";
B._Jer4_8="For this put on haircloth, with weeping and loud crying: for the burning wrath of the Lord is not turned back from us.";
B._Jer4_9="And it will come about in that day, says the Lord, that the heart of the king will be dead in him, and the hearts of the rulers; and the priests will be overcome with fear, and the prophets with wonder.";
B._Jer4_10="Then said I, Ah, Lord God! your words were not true when you said to this people and to Jerusalem, You will have peace; when the sword has come even to the soul.";
B._Jer4_11="At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A burning wind from the open hilltops in the waste land is blowing on the daughter of my people, not for separating or cleaning the grain;";
B._Jer4_12="A full wind will come for me: and now I will give my decision against them.";
B._Jer4_13="See, he will come up like the clouds, and his war-carriages like the storm-wind: his horses are quicker than eagles. Sorrow is ours, for destruction has come on us.";
B._Jer4_14="O Jerusalem, make your heart clean from evil, so that you may have salvation. How long are evil purposes to have a resting-place in you?";
B._Jer4_15="For a voice is sounding from Dan, giving out evil from the hills of Ephraim:";
B._Jer4_16="Make this come to the minds of the nations, make a statement openly against Jerusalem, that attackers are coming from a far country and their voices will be loud against the towns of Judah.";
B._Jer4_17="Like keepers of a field they are against her on every side; because she has been fighting against me, says the Lord.";
B._Jer4_18="Your ways and your doings have made these things come on you; this is your sin; truly it is bitter, going deep into your heart.";
B._Jer4_19="My soul, my soul! I am pained to my inmost heart; my heart is troubled in me; I am not able to be quiet, because the sound of the horn, the note of war, has come to my ears.";
B._Jer4_20="News is given of destruction on destruction; all the land is made waste: suddenly my tents, straight away my curtains, are made waste.";
B._Jer4_21="How long will I go on seeing the flag and hearing the sound of the war-horn?";
B._Jer4_22="For my people are foolish, they have no knowledge of me; they are evil-minded children, without sense, all of them: they are wise in evil-doing, but have no knowledge of doing good.";
B._Jer4_23="Looking at the earth, I saw that it was waste and without form; and to the heavens, that they had no light.";
B._Jer4_24="Looking at the mountains, I saw them shaking, and all the hills were moved about.";
B._Jer4_25="Looking, I saw that there was no man, and all the birds of heaven had gone in flight.";
B._Jer4_26="Looking, I saw that the fertile field was a waste, and all its towns were broken down before the Lord and before his burning wrath.";
B._Jer4_27="For this is what the Lord has said: All the land will become a waste; I will make destruction complete.";
B._Jer4_28="The earth will be weeping for this, and the heavens on high will be black: because I have said it, and I will not go back from it; it is my purpose, and it will not be changed.";
B._Jer4_29="All the land is in flight because of the noise of the horsemen and the bowmen; they have taken cover in the woodland and up on the rocks: every town has been given up, not a man is living in them.";
B._Jer4_30="And you, when you are made waste, what will you do? Though you are clothed in red, though you make yourself beautiful with ornaments of gold, though you make your eyes wide with paint, it is for nothing that you make yourself fair; your lovers have no more desire for you, they have designs on your life.";
B._Jer4_31="A voice has come to my ears like the voice of a woman in birth-pains, the pain of one giving birth to her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, fighting for breath, stretching out her hands, saying, Now sorrow is mine! for my strength is gone from me before the takers of life.";
B._Jer5_1="Go quickly through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and get knowledge, and make a search in her wide places if there is a man, if there is one in her who is upright, who keeps faith; and she will have my forgiveness.";
B._Jer5_2="And though they say, By the living Lord; truly their oaths are false.";
B._Jer5_3="O Lord, do not your eyes see good faith? you have given them punishment, but they were not troubled; you have sent destruction on them, but they did not take your teaching to heart: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they would not come back.";
B._Jer5_4="Then I said, But these are the poor: they are foolish, for they have no knowledge of the way of the Lord or of the behaviour desired by their God.";
B._Jer5_5="I will go to the great men and have talk with them; for they have knowledge of the way of the Lord and of the behaviour desired by their God. But as for these, their one purpose is a broken yoke and burst bands.";
B._Jer5_6="And so a lion from the woods will put them to death, a wolf of the waste land will make them waste, a leopard will keep watch on their towns, and everyone who goes out from them will be food for the beasts; because of the great number of their sins and the increase of their wrongdoing.";
B._Jer5_7="How is it possible for you to have my forgiveness for this? your children have given me up, taking their oaths by those who are no gods: when I had given them food in full measure, they were false to their wives, taking their pleasure in the houses of loose women.";
