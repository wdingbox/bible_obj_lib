B._Exo5_3="And they said, The God of the Hebrews has come to us: let us then go three days' journey into the waste land to make an offering to the Lord our God, so that he may not send death on us by disease or the sword.";
B._Exo5_4="And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people away from their work? get back to your work.";
B._Exo5_5="And Pharaoh said, Truly, the people of the land are increasing in number, and you are keeping them back from their work.";
B._Exo5_6="The same day Pharaoh gave orders to the overseers and those who were responsible for the work, saying,";
B._Exo5_7="Give these men no more dry stems for their brick-making as you have been doing; let them go and get the material for themselves.";
B._Exo5_8="But see that they make the same number of bricks as before, and no less: for they have no love for work; and so they are crying out and saying, Let us go and make an offering to our God.";
B._Exo5_9="Give the men harder work, and see that they do it; let them not give attention to false words.";
B._Exo5_10="And the overseers of the people and their responsible men went out and said to the people, Pharaoh says, I will give you no more dry stems.";
B._Exo5_11="Go yourselves and get dry stems wherever you are able; for your work is not to be any less.";
B._Exo5_12="So the people were sent in all directions through the land of Egypt to get dry grass for stems.";
B._Exo5_13="And the overseers went on driving them and saying, Do your full day's work as before when there were dry stems for you.";
B._Exo5_14="And the responsible men of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's overseers had put over them, were given blows, and they said to them, Why have you not done your regular work, in making bricks as before?";
B._Exo5_15="Then the responsible men of the children of Israel came to Pharaoh, protesting and saying, Why are you acting in this way to your servants?";
B._Exo5_16="They give us no dry stems and they say to us, Make bricks: and they give your servants blows; but it is your people who are in the wrong.";
B._Exo5_17="But he said, You have no love for work: that is why you say, Let us go and make an offering to the Lord.";
B._Exo5_18="Go now, get back to your work; no dry stems will be given to you, but you are to make the full number of bricks.";
B._Exo5_19="Then the responsible men of the children of Israel saw that they were purposing evil when they said, The number of bricks which you have to make every day will be no less than before.";
B._Exo5_20="And they came face to face with Moses and Aaron, who were in their way when they came out from Pharaoh:";
B._Exo5_21="And they said to them, May the Lord take note of you and be your judge; for you have given Pharaoh and his servants a bad opinion of us, putting a sword in their hands for our destruction.";
B._Exo5_22="And Moses went back to the Lord and said, Lord, why have you done evil to this people? why have you sent me?";
B._Exo5_23="For from the time when I came to Pharaoh to put your words before him, he has done evil to this people, and you have given them no help.";
B._Exo6_1="And the Lord said to Moses, Now you will see what I am about to do to Pharaoh; for by a strong hand he will be forced to let them go, driving them out of his land because of my outstretched arm.";
B._Exo6_2="And God said to Moses, I am Yahweh:";
B._Exo6_3="I let myself be seen by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as God, the Ruler of all; but they had no knowledge of my name Yahweh.";
B._Exo6_4="And I made an agreement with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their wanderings.";
B._Exo6_5="And truly my ears are open to the cry of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians keep under their yoke; and I have kept in mind my agreement.";
B._Exo6_6="Say then to the children of Israel, I am Yahweh, and I will take you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians, and make you safe from their power, and will make you free by the strength of my arm after great punishments.";
B._Exo6_7="And I will take you to be my people and I will be your God; and you will be certain that I am the Lord your God, who takes you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.";
B._Exo6_8="And I will be your guide into the land which I made an oath to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for your heritage: I am Yahweh.";
B._Exo6_9="And Moses said these words to the children of Israel, but they gave no attention to him, because of the grief of their spirit and the cruel weight of their work.";
B._Exo6_10="And the Lord said to Moses,";
B._Exo6_11="Go in and say to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he is to let the children of Israel go out of his land.";
B._Exo6_12="And Moses, answering the Lord, said, See, the children of Israel will not give ear to me; how then will Pharaoh give ear to me, whose lips are unclean?";
B._Exo6_13="And the word of the Lord came to Moses and Aaron, with orders for the children of Israel and for Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to take the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo6_14="These are the heads of their fathers' families: the sons of Reuben the oldest son of Israel: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi: these are the families of Reuben.";
B._Exo6_15="And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul, the son of a woman of Canaan: these are the families of Simeon.";

B._Exo6_17="The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, in the order of their families.";
B._Exo6_18="And the sons of Kohath: Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel: and the years of Kohath's life were a hundred and thirty-three.";
B._Exo6_19="And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi: these are the families of the Levites, in the order of their generations.";
B._Exo6_20="And Amram took Jochebed, his father's sister, as wife; and she gave birth to Aaron and Moses: and the years of Amram's life were a hundred and thirty-seven.";

B._Exo6_22="And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael and Elzaphan and Sithri.";

B._Exo6_25="And Eleazar, Aaron's son, took as his wife one of the daughters of Putiel; and she gave birth to Phinehas. These are the heads of the families of the Levites, in the order of their families.";
B._Exo6_26="These are the same Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said, Take the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt in their armies.";
B._Exo6_27="These are the men who gave orders to Pharaoh to let the children of Israel go out of Egypt: these are the same Moses and Aaron.";
B._Exo6_28="And on the day when the word of the Lord came to Moses in the land of Egypt,";
B._Exo6_29="The Lord said to Moses, I am the Lord: say to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, everything I am saying to you.";
B._Exo6_30="And Moses said to the Lord, My lips are unclean; how is it possible that Pharaoh will give me a hearing?";
B._Exo7_1="And the Lord said to Moses, See I have made you a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother will be your prophet.";
B._Exo7_2="Say whatever I give you orders to say: and Aaron your brother will give word to Pharaoh to let the children of Israel go out of his land.";
B._Exo7_3="And I will make Pharaoh's heart hard, and my signs and wonders will be increased in the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo7_4="But Pharaoh will not give ear to you, and I will put my hand on Egypt, and take my armies, my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt, after great punishments.";
B._Exo7_5="And the Egyptians will see that I am the Lord, when my hand is stretched out over Egypt, and I take the children of Israel out from among them.";
B._Exo7_6="And Moses and Aaron did so: as the Lord gave them orders, so they did.";
B._Exo7_7="And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they gave the Lord's word to Pharaoh.";
B._Exo7_8="And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron,";
B._Exo7_9="If Pharaoh says to you, Let me see a wonder: then say to Aaron, Take your rod and put it down on the earth before Pharaoh so that it may become a snake.";
B._Exo7_10="Then Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and they did as the Lord had said: and Aaron put his rod down on the earth before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a snake.";
B._Exo7_11="Then Pharaoh sent for the wise men and the wonder-workers, and they, the wonder-workers of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts.";
B._Exo7_12="For every one of them put down his rod on the earth, and they became snakes: but Aaron's rod made a meal of their rods.";
B._Exo7_13="But Pharaoh's heart was made hard, and he did not give ear to them, as the Lord had said.";
B._Exo7_14="And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, Pharaoh's heart is unchanged; he will not let the people go.";
B._Exo7_15="Go to Pharaoh in the morning; when he goes out to the water, you will be waiting for him by the edge of the Nile, with the rod which was turned into a snake in your hand;";
B._Exo7_16="And say to him, The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, Let my people go so that they may give me worship in the waste land; but up to now you have not given ear to his words.";
B._Exo7_17="So the Lord says, By this you may be certain that I am the Lord; see, by the touch of this rod in my hand the waters of the Nile will be turned to blood;";
B._Exo7_18="And the fish in the Nile will come to destruction, and the river will send up a bad smell, and the Egyptians will not be able, for disgust, to make use of the water of the Nile for drinking.";
B._Exo7_19="And the Lord said, Say to Aaron, Let the rod in your hand be stretched out over the waters of Egypt, and over the rivers and the streams and the pools, and over every stretch of water, so that they may be turned to blood; and there will be blood through all the land of Egypt, in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.";
B._Exo7_20="And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had said; and when his rod had been lifted up and stretched out over the waters of the Nile before the eyes of Pharaoh and his servants, all the water in the Nile was turned to blood;";
B._Exo7_21="And the fish in the Nile came to destruction, and a bad smell went up from the river, and the Egyptians were not able to make use of the water of the Nile for drinking; and there was blood through all the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo7_22="And the wonder-workers of Egypt did the same with their secret arts: but Pharaoh's heart was made hard, and he would not give ear to them, as the Lord had said.";
B._Exo7_23="Then Pharaoh went into his house, and did not take even this to heart.";
B._Exo7_24="And all the Egyptians made holes round about the Nile to get drinking-water, for they were not able to make use of the Nile water.";
B._Exo7_25="And seven days went past, after the Lord had put his hand on the Nile.";
B._Exo8_1="And this is what the Lord said to Moses: Go to Pharaoh and say to him, The Lord says, Let my people go so that they may give me worship.";
B._Exo8_2="And if you will not let them go, see, I will send frogs into every part of your land:";
B._Exo8_3="The Nile will be full of frogs, and they will come up into your house and into your bedrooms and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants and your people, and into your ovens and into your bread-basins.";
B._Exo8_4="The frogs will come up over you and your people and all your servants.";
B._Exo8_5="And the Lord said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Let the rod in your hand be stretched out over the streams and the waterways and the pools, causing frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo8_6="And when Aaron put out his hand over the waters of Egypt, the frogs came up and all the land of Egypt was covered with them.";
B._Exo8_7="And the wonder-workers did the same with their secret arts, making frogs come up over the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo8_8="Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said, Make prayer to the Lord that he will take away these frogs from me and my people; and I will let the people go and make their offering to the Lord.";
B._Exo8_9="And Moses said, I will let you have the honour of saying when I am to make prayer for you and your servants and your people, that the frogs may be sent away from you and your houses, and be only in the Nile.";
B._Exo8_10="And he said, By tomorrow. And he said, Let it be as you say: so that you may see that there is no other like the Lord our God.";
B._Exo8_11="And the frogs will be gone from you and from your houses and from your servants and from your people and will be only in the Nile.";
B._Exo8_12="Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses made prayer to the Lord about the frogs which he had sent on Pharaoh.";
B._Exo8_13="And the Lord did as Moses said; and there was an end of all the frogs in the houses and in the open spaces and in the fields.";
B._Exo8_14="And they put them together in masses, and a bad smell went up from the land.";
B._Exo8_15="But when Pharaoh saw that there was peace for a time, he made his heart hard and did not give ear to them, as the Lord had said.";
B._Exo8_16="And the Lord said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Let your rod be stretched out over the dust of the earth so that it may become insects through all the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo8_17="And they did so; and Aaron, stretching out the rod in his hand, gave a touch to the dust of the earth, and insects came on man and on beast; all the dust of the earth was changed into insects through all the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo8_18="And the wonder-workers with their secret arts, attempting to make insects, were unable to do so: and there were insects on man and on beast.";
B._Exo8_19="Then the wonder-workers said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: but Pharaoh's heart was hard, and he did not give ear to them, as the Lord had said.";
B._Exo8_20="And the Lord said to Moses, Get up early in the morning and take your place before Pharaoh when he comes out to the water; and say to him, This is what the Lord says: Let my people go to give me worship.";
B._Exo8_21="For if you do not let my people go, see, I will send clouds of flies on you and on your servants and on your people and into their houses; and the houses of the Egyptians and the land where they are will be full of flies.";
B._Exo8_22="And at that time I will make a division between your land and the land of Goshen where my people are, and no flies will be there; so that you may see that I am the Lord over all the earth.";
B._Exo8_23="And I will put a division between my people and your people; tomorrow this sign will be seen.";
B._Exo8_24="And the Lord did so; and great clouds of flies came into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants' houses, and all the land of Egypt was made waste because of the flies.";
B._Exo8_25="And Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said, Go and make your offering to your God here in the land.";
B._Exo8_26="And Moses said, It is not right to do so; for we make our offerings of that to which the Egyptians give worship; and if we do so before their eyes, certainly we will be stoned.";
B._Exo8_27="But we will go three days' journey into the waste land and make an offering to the Lord our God as he may give us orders.";
B._Exo8_28="Then Pharaoh said, I will let you go to make an offering to the Lord your God in the waste land; but do not go very far away, and make prayer for me.";
B._Exo8_29="And Moses said, When I go out from you I will make prayer to the Lord that the cloud of flies may go away from Pharaoh and from his people and from his servants tomorrow: only let Pharaoh no longer by deceit keep back the people from making their offering to the Lord.";
B._Exo8_30="Then Moses went out from Pharaoh and made prayer to the Lord.";
B._Exo8_31="And the Lord did as Moses said, and took away the cloud of flies from Pharaoh and from his servants and from his people; not one was to be seen.";
B._Exo8_32="But again Pharaoh made his heart hard and did not let the people go.";
B._Exo9_1="Then the Lord said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go so that they may give me worship.";
B._Exo9_2="For if you will not let them go, but still keep them in your power,";
B._Exo9_3="Then the hand of the Lord will put on your cattle in the field, on the horses and the asses and the camels, on the herds and the flocks, a very evil disease.";
B._Exo9_4="And the Lord will make a division between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; there will be no loss of any of the cattle of Israel.";
B._Exo9_5="And the time was fixed by the Lord, and he said, Tomorrow the Lord will do this thing in the land.";
B._Exo9_6="And on the day after, the Lord did as he had said, causing the death of all the cattle of Egypt, but there was no loss of any of the cattle of Israel.";
B._Exo9_7="And Pharaoh sent and got word that there was no loss of any of the cattle of Israel. But the heart of Pharaoh was hard and he did not let the people go.";
B._Exo9_8="And the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, Take in your hand a little dust from the fire and let Moses send it in a shower up to heaven before the eyes of Pharaoh.";
B._Exo9_9="And it will become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and will be a skin-disease bursting out in wounds on man and beast through all the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo9_10="So they took some dust from the fire, and placing themselves before Pharaoh, Moses sent it out in a shower up to heaven; and it became a skin-disease bursting out on man and on beast.";
B._Exo9_11="And the wonder-workers were not able to take their places before Moses, because of the disease; for the disease was on the wonder-workers and on all the Egyptians.";
B._Exo9_12="And the Lord made Pharaoh's heart hard, and he would not give ear to them, as the Lord had said.";
B._Exo9_13="And the Lord said to Moses, Get up early in the morning and take your place before Pharaoh, and say to him, This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go so that they may give me worship.";
B._Exo9_14="For this time I will send all my punishments on yourself and on your servants and on your people; so that you may see that there is no other like me in all the earth.";
B._Exo9_15="For if I had put the full weight of my hand on you and your people, you would have been cut off from the earth:";
B._Exo9_16="But, for this very reason, I have kept you from destruction, to make clear to you my power, and so that my name may be honoured through all the earth.";
B._Exo9_17="Are you still uplifted in pride against my people so that you will not let them go?";
B._Exo9_18="Truly, tomorrow about this time I will send down an ice-storm, such as never was in Egypt from its earliest days till now.";
B._Exo9_19="Then send quickly and get in your cattle and all you have from the fields; for if any man or beast in the field has not been put under cover, the ice-storm will come down on them with destruction.";
B._Exo9_20="Then everyone among the servants of Pharaoh who had the fear of the Lord, made his servants and his cattle come quickly into the house:";
B._Exo9_21="And he who gave no attention to the word of the Lord, kept his servants and his cattle in the field.";
B._Exo9_22="And the Lord said to Moses, Now let your hand be stretched out to heaven so that there may be an ice-storm on all the land of Egypt, on man and on beast and on every plant of the field through all the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo9_23="And Moses put out his rod to heaven: and the Lord sent thunder, and an ice-storm, and fire running down on the earth; the Lord sent an ice-storm on the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo9_24="So there was an ice-storm with fire running through it, coming down with great force, such as never was in all the land of Egypt from the time when it became a nation.";
B._Exo9_25="And through all the land of Egypt the ice-storm came down on everything which was in the fields, on man and on beast; and every green plant was crushed and every tree of the field broken.";
B._Exo9_26="Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no ice-storm.";
B._Exo9_27="Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have done evil this time: the Lord is upright, and I and my people are sinners.";
B._Exo9_28="Make prayer to the Lord; for there has been enough of these thunderings of God and this ice-storm; and I will let you go and will keep you no longer.";
B._Exo9_29="And Moses said, When I am gone outside the town, my hands will be stretched out to the Lord; the thunders and the ice-storm will come to an end, so that you may see that the earth is the Lord's.";
B._Exo9_30="But as for you and your servants, I am certain that even now the fear of the Lord God will not be in your hearts.";
B._Exo9_31="And the flax and the barley were damaged, for the barley was almost ready to be cut and the flax was in flower.";
B._Exo9_32="But the rest of the grain-plants were undamaged, for they had not come up.";
B._Exo9_33="So Moses went out of the town, and stretching out his hands made prayer to God: and the thunders and the ice-storm came to an end; and the fall of rain was stopped.";
B._Exo9_34="But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the ice-storm and the thunders were ended, he went on sinning, and made his heart hard, he and his servants.";
B._Exo9_35="And the heart of Pharaoh was hard, and he did not let the people go, as the Lord had said by the mouth of Moses.";
B._Exo10_1="And the Lord said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh: for I have made his heart and the hearts of his servants hard, so that I may let my signs be seen among them:";
B._Exo10_2="And so that you may be able to give to your son and to your son's son the story of my wonders in Egypt, and the signs which I have done among them; so that you may see that I am the Lord.";
B._Exo10_3="Then Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: How long will you be lifted up in your pride before me? let my people go so that they may give me worship.";
B._Exo10_4="For if you will not let my people go, tomorrow I will send locusts into your land:";
B._Exo10_5="And the face of the earth will be covered with them, so that you will not be able to see the earth: and they will be the destruction of everything which up to now has not been damaged, everything which was not crushed by the ice-storm, and every tree still living in your fields.";
B._Exo10_6="And your houses will be full of them, and the houses of your servants and of all the Egyptians; it will be worse than anything your fathers have seen or their fathers, from the day when they were living on the earth till this day. And so he went out from Pharaoh.";
B._Exo10_7="And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long is this man to be the cause of evil to us? let the men go so that they may give worship to the Lord their God: are you not awake to Egypt's danger?";
B._Exo10_8="Then Moses and Aaron came in again before Pharaoh: and he said to them, Go and give worship to the Lord your God: but which of you are going?";
B._Exo10_9="And Moses said, We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds; for we are to keep a feast to the Lord.";
B._Exo10_10="And he said to them, May the Lord be with you, if I will let you and your little ones go! take care, for your purpose clearly is evil.";
B._Exo10_11="Not so; but let your males go and give worship to the Lord, as your desire is. This he said, driving them out from before him.";
B._Exo10_12="And the Lord said to Moses, Let your hand be stretched out over the land of Egypt so that the locusts may come up on the land for the destruction of every green plant in the land, even everything untouched by the ice-storm.";
B._Exo10_13="And Moses' rod was stretched out over the land of Egypt, and the Lord sent an east wind over the land all that day and all the night; and in the morning the locusts came up with the east wind.";
B._Exo10_14="And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, resting on every part of the land, in very great numbers; such an army of locusts had never been seen before, and never will be again.";
B._Exo10_15="For all the face of the earth was covered with them, so that the land was black; and every green plant and all the fruit of the trees which was untouched by the ice-storm they took for food: not one green thing, no plant or tree, was to be seen in all the land of Egypt.";
B._Exo10_16="Then Pharaoh quickly sent for Moses and Aaron, and said, I have done evil against the Lord your God and against you.";
B._Exo10_17="Let me now have forgiveness for my sin this time only, and make prayer to the Lord your God that he will take away from me this death only.";
