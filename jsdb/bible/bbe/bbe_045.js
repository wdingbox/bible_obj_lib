B._1Sa13_15="Then Samuel went up from Gilgal and the rest of the people went up after Saul against the men of war, and they came from Gilgal to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin: and Saul took the number of the people who were with him, about six hundred men.";
B._1Sa13_16="And Saul, with Jonathan his son and the people who were with them, was waiting in Geba in the land of Benjamin: but the tents of the Philistines were in Michmash.";
B._1Sa13_17="And three bands of men came out from the Philistines to make an attack; one band went by the road which goes to Ophrah, into the land of Shual:";
B._1Sa13_18="And another went in the direction of Beth-horon: and another went by the hill looking down on the valley of Zeboiim, in the direction of the waste land.";
B._1Sa13_19="Now there was no iron-worker in all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, For fear the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears:";
B._1Sa13_20="But all the Israelites had to go to the Philistines to get their ploughs and blades and axes and hooks made sharp;";
B._1Sa13_21="For they had instruments for putting an edge on their ploughs and blades and forks and axes, and for putting iron points on their ox-driving rods.";
B._1Sa13_22="So on the day of the fight at Michmash, not a sword or a spear was to be seen in the hands of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan: only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.";
B._1Sa13_23="And the armed force of the Philistines went out to the narrow way of Michmash.";
B._1Sa14_1="Now one day Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man who was with him, looking after his arms, Come, let us go over to the Philistine force over there. But he said nothing to his father.";
B._1Sa14_2="And Saul was still waiting in the farthest part of Geba, under the fruit-tree in Migron: there were about six hundred men with him;";
B._1Sa14_3="And Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, brother of Ichabod, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the Lord in Shiloh, who had the ephod. And the people had no idea that Jonathan had gone.";
B._1Sa14_4="Now between the narrow roads over the mountains by which Jonathan was making his way to the Philistines' forces, there was a sharp overhanging rock on one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: one was named Bozez and the other Seneh.";
B._1Sa14_5="The one rock went up on the north in front of Michmash and the other on the south in front of Geba.";
B._1Sa14_6="And Jonathan said to his young servant who had his arms, Come, let us go over to the armies of these men who have no circumcision: it may be that the Lord will give us help, for there is no limit to his power; the Lord is able to give salvation by a great army or by a small band.";
B._1Sa14_7="And his servant said to him, Do whatever is in your mind: see, I am with you in every impulse of your heart.";
B._1Sa14_8="Then Jonathan said, Now we will go over to these men and let them see us.";
B._1Sa14_9="If they say to us, Keep quiet where you are till we come to you; then we will keep our places and not go up to them.";
B._1Sa14_10="But if they say, Come up to us; then we will go up, for the Lord has given them into our hands: and this will be the sign to us.";
B._1Sa14_11="And they let the Philistine force see the two of them: and the Philistines said, Look! the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have taken cover.";
B._1Sa14_12="And the armed men of the force gave Jonathan and his servant their answer, saying, Come up here to us, and we will let you see something. Then Jonathan said to his servant, Come up after me: for the Lord has given them up into the hands of Israel.";
B._1Sa14_13="And Jonathan went up, gripping with his hands and his feet, his servant going up after him; and the Philistines gave way before Jonathan when he made an attack on them, and his servant put them to death after him.";
B._1Sa14_14="And at their first attack, Jonathan and his servant put to the sword about twenty men, all inside the space of half an acre of land.";
B._1Sa14_15="And there was great fear in the tents and in the field and among all the men of the armed force, and the attackers were shaking with fear; even the earth was moved with a great shaking and there was a fear as from God.";
B._1Sa14_16="And the watchmen of Saul, looking out from Geba in the land of Benjamin, saw all the army flowing away and running here and there.";
B._1Sa14_17="Then Saul said to the people who were with him, Let everyone be numbered and let us see who has gone from us. And when they had been numbered, it was seen that Jonathan and his servant were not there.";
B._1Sa14_18="And Saul said to Ahijah, Let the ephod come here. For he went before Israel with the ephod at that time.";
B._1Sa14_19="Now while Saul was talking to the priest, the noise in the tents of the Philistines became louder and louder; and Saul said to the priest, Take back your hand.";
B._1Sa14_20="And Saul and all the people with him came together and went forward to the fight: and every man's sword was turned against the man at his side, and there was a very great noise.";
B._1Sa14_21="Then the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines for some time, and had gone up with them to their tents, turning round were joined to those who were with Saul and Jonathan.";
B._1Sa14_22="And all the men of Israel who had taken cover in the hill-country of Ephraim, hearing that the Philistines had been put to flight, went after them, attacking them.";
B._1Sa14_23="So the Lord made Israel safe that day: and the fight went over to Beth-aven.";
B._1Sa14_24="And all the people were with Saul, about twenty thousand men, and the fight was general through all the hill-country of Ephraim; but Saul made a great error that day, by putting the people under an oath, saying, Let that man be cursed who takes food before evening comes and I have given punishment to those who are against me. So the people had not a taste of food.";
B._1Sa14_25="And there was honey on the face of the field, and all the people came to the honey, the bees having gone from it;";
B._1Sa14_26="But not a man put his hand to his mouth for fear of the curse.";
B._1Sa14_27="But Jonathan, having no knowledge of the oath his father had put on the people, stretching out the rod which was in his hand, put the end of it in the honey, and put it to his mouth; then his eyes were made bright.";
B._1Sa14_28="Then one of the people said to him, Your father put the people under an oath, saying, Let that man be cursed who takes any food this day. And the people were feeble, needing food.";
B._1Sa14_29="Then Jonathan said, My father has made trouble come on the land: now see how bright my eyes have become because I have taken a little of this honey.";
B._1Sa14_30="How much more if the people had freely taken their food from the goods of those who were fighting against them! would there not have been much greater destruction among the Philistines?";
B._1Sa14_31="That day they overcame the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were feeble from need of food.";
B._1Sa14_32="And rushing at the goods taken in the fight, the people took oxen and sheep and young oxen, and put them to death there on the earth, and had a meal, taking the flesh with the blood in it.";
B._1Sa14_33="Then it was said to Saul, See, the people are sinning against the Lord, taking the blood with the flesh. And he said to those who gave him the news, Now let a great stone be rolled to me here.";
B._1Sa14_34="And Saul said, Go about among the people and say to them, Let every man come here to me with his ox and his sheep, and put them to death here, and take his meal: do no sin against the Lord by taking the blood with the flesh. So all the people took their oxen with them that night and put them to death there.";
B._1Sa14_35="And Saul put up an altar to the Lord: this was the first altar which he put up to the Lord.";
B._1Sa14_36="And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, attacking them till the morning, till there is not a man of them living. And they said, Do whatever seems right to you. Then the priest said, Let us come near to God.";
B._1Sa14_37="And Saul, desiring directions from God, said, Am I to go down after the Philistines? will you give them up into the hands of Israel? But he gave him no answer that day.";
B._1Sa14_38="And Saul said, Come near, all you chiefs of the people, and let us get word from God and see in whom is this sin today.";
B._1Sa14_39="For, by the living Lord, the saviour of Israel, even if the sinner is Jonathan, my son, death will certainly be his fate. But not a man among all the people gave him any answer.";
B._1Sa14_40="Then he said to all Israel, You be on one side, and I with Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do whatever seems good to you.";
B._1Sa14_41="Then Saul said to the Lord, the God of Israel, Why have you not given me an answer today? If the sin is in me or in Jonathan my son, O Lord God of Israel, give Urim, and if it is in your people Israel, give Thummim. And by the decision of the Lord, Saul and Jonathan were marked out, and the people went free.";
B._1Sa14_42="And Saul said, Give your decision between my son Jonathan and me. And Jonathan was taken.";
B._1Sa14_43="Then Saul said to Jonathan, Give me an account of what you have done. And Jonathan gave him the story and said, Certainly I took a little honey on the end of my rod; and now death is to be my fate.";
B._1Sa14_44="And Saul said, May God's punishment be on me if death is not your fate, Jonathan.";
B._1Sa14_45="And the people said to Saul, Is death to come to Jonathan, the worker of this great salvation for Israel? Let it not be so: by the living Lord, not one hair of his head is to be touched, for he has been working with God today. So the people kept Jonathan from death.";
B._1Sa14_46="Then Saul, turning back, went after the Philistines no longer: and the Philistines went back to their place.";
B._1Sa14_47="Now when Saul had taken his place as ruler of Israel, he made war on those who were against him on every side, Moab and the Ammonites and Edom and the kings of Zobah and the Philistines: and whichever way he went, he overcame them.";
B._1Sa14_48="And he did great things, and overcame the Amalekites, and made Israel safe from the hands of their attackers.";
B._1Sa14_49="Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan and Ishvi and Malchi-shua; and these are the names of his daughters: the older was named Merab and the younger Michal;";
B._1Sa14_50="The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz; the captain of his army was Abner, the son of Ner, brother of Saul's father.";
B._1Sa14_51="Kish, the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abner, were sons of Abiel.";
B._1Sa14_52="All through the life of Saul there was bitter war against the Philistines; and whenever Saul saw any strong man or any good fighting man, he kept him near himself.";
B._1Sa15_1="And Samuel said to Saul, The Lord sent me to put the holy oil on you and to make you king over his people, over Israel: so give ear now to the words of the Lord.";
B._1Sa15_2="The Lord of armies says, I will give punishment to Amalek for what he did to Israel, fighting against him on the way when Israel came out of Egypt.";
B._1Sa15_3="Go now and put Amalek to the sword, putting to the curse all they have, without mercy: put to death every man and woman, every child and baby at the breast, every ox and sheep, camel and ass.";
B._1Sa15_4="And Saul sent for the people and had them numbered in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah.";
B._1Sa15_5="And Saul came to the town of Amalek, and took up his position in the valley secretly.";
B._1Sa15_6="And Saul said to the Kenites, Go away, take yourselves out from among the Amalekites, or destruction will overtake you with them: for you were kind to the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt. So the Kenites went away from among the Amalekites.";
B._1Sa15_7="And Saul made an attack on the Amalekites from Havilah on the road to Shur, which is before Egypt.";
B._1Sa15_8="He took Agag, king of the Amalekites, prisoner, and put all the people to the sword without mercy.";
B._1Sa15_9="But Saul and the people did not put Agag to death, and they kept the best of the sheep and the oxen and the fat beasts and the lambs, and whatever was good, not desiring to put them to the curse: but everything which was bad and of no use they put to the curse.";
B._1Sa15_10="Then the Lord said to Samuel,";
B._1Sa15_11="It is no longer my pleasure for Saul to be king; for he is turned back from going in my ways, and has not done my orders. And Samuel was very sad, crying to the Lord in prayer all night.";
B._1Sa15_12="And early in the morning he got up and went to Saul; and word was given to Samuel that Saul had come to Carmel and put up a pillar, and had gone from there down to Gilgal.";
B._1Sa15_13="And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, May the blessing of the Lord be with you: I have done what was ordered by the Lord.";
B._1Sa15_14="And Samuel said, What then is this sound of the crying of sheep and the noise of oxen which comes to my ears?";
B._1Sa15_15="And Saul said, They have taken them from the Amalekites: for the people have kept the best of the sheep and of the oxen as an offering to the Lord your God; all the rest we have given up to destruction.";
B._1Sa15_16="Then Samuel said to Saul, Say no more! Let me give you word of what the Lord has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.";
B._1Sa15_17="And Samuel said, Though you may seem little to yourself, are you not head of the tribes of Israel? for the Lord with the holy oil made you king over Israel,";
B._1Sa15_18="And the Lord sent you on a journey and said, Go and put to the curse those sinners, the Amalekites, fighting against them till every one is dead.";
B._1Sa15_19="Why then did you not do the orders of the Lord, but by violently taking their goods did evil in the eyes of the Lord?";
B._1Sa15_20="And Saul said, Truly, I have done the orders of the Lord and have gone the way the Lord sent me; I have taken Agag, the king of Amalek, and have given the Amalekites up to destruction.";
B._1Sa15_21="But the people took some of their goods, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which were put to the curse, to make an offering of them to the Lord your God in Gilgal.";
B._1Sa15_22="And Samuel said, Has the Lord as much delight in offerings and burned offerings as in the doing of his orders? Truly, to do his pleasure is better than to make offerings, and to give ear to him than the fat of sheep.";
B._1Sa15_23="For to go against his orders is like the sin of those who make use of secret arts, and pride is like giving worship to images. Because you have put away from you the word of the Lord, he has put you from your place as king.";
B._1Sa15_24="And Saul said to Samuel, Great is my sin: for I have gone against the orders of the Lord and against your words: because, fearing the people, I did what they said.";
B._1Sa15_25="So now, let my sin have forgiveness, and go back with me to give worship to the Lord.";
B._1Sa15_26="And Samuel said to Saul, I will not go back with you: for you have put away from you the word of the Lord, and the Lord has put you from your place as king over Israel.";
B._1Sa15_27="And when Samuel was turning round to go away, Saul took the skirt of his robe in his hand, and the cloth came away.";
B._1Sa15_28="And Samuel said to him, The Lord has taken away the kingdom of Israel from you this day by force, and has given it to a neighbour of yours who is better than you.";
B._1Sa15_29="And further, the Glory of Israel will not say what is false, and his purpose may not be changed: for he is not a man, whose purpose may be changed.";
B._1Sa15_30="Then he said, Great is my sin: but still, give me honour now before the heads of my people and before Israel, and come back with me so that I may give worship to the Lord your God.";
B._1Sa15_31="So Samuel went back after Saul, and Saul gave worship to the Lord.";
B._1Sa15_32="Then Samuel said, Make Agag, the king of the Amalekites, come here to me. And Agag came to him shaking with fear. And Agag said, Truly the pain of death is past.";
B._1Sa15_33="And Samuel said, As your sword has made women without children, so now your mother will be without children among women. And Agag was cut up by Samuel, bone from bone, before the Lord in Gilgal.";
B._1Sa15_34="Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah, in the land of Saul.";
B._1Sa15_35="And Samuel never saw Saul again till the day of his death; but Samuel was sorrowing for Saul: and it was no longer the Lord's pleasure for Saul to be king over Israel.";
B._1Sa16_1="And the Lord said to Samuel, How long will you go on sorrowing for Saul, seeing that I have put him from his place as king over Israel? Take oil in your vessel and go; I will send you to Jesse, the Beth-lehemite: for I have got a king for myself among his sons.";
B._1Sa16_2="And Samuel said, How is it possible for me to go? If Saul gets news of it he will put me to death. And the Lord said, Take a young cow with you and say, I have come to make an offering to the Lord.";
B._1Sa16_3="And send for Jesse to be present at the offering, and I will make clear to you what you are to do: and you are to put the holy oil on him whose name I give you.";
B._1Sa16_4="And Samuel did as the Lord said and came to Beth-lehem. And the responsible men of the town came out to him in fear and said, Do you come in peace?";
B._1Sa16_5="And he said, In peace: I have come to make an offering to the Lord: make yourselves clean and come with me to make the offering. And he made Jesse and his sons clean, and sent for them to be present at the offering.";
B._1Sa16_6="Now when they came, looking at Eliab, he said, Clearly the man of the Lord's selection is before him.";
B._1Sa16_7="But the Lord said to Samuel, Do not take note of his face or how tall he is, because I will not have him: for the Lord's view is not man's; man takes note of the outer form, but the Lord sees the heart.";
B._1Sa16_8="Then Jesse sent for Abinadab and made him come before Samuel. And he said, The Lord has not taken this one.";
B._1Sa16_9="Then Jesse made Shammah come before him. And he said, The Lord has not taken this one.";
B._1Sa16_10="And Jesse made his seven sons come before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, The Lord has not taken any of these.";
B._1Sa16_11="Then Samuel said to Jesse, Are all your children here? And he said, There is still the youngest, and he is looking after the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and make him come here: for we will not take our seats till he is here.";
B._1Sa16_12="So he sent and made him come in. Now he had red hair and beautiful eyes and pleasing looks. And the Lord said, Come, put the oil on him, for this is he.";
B._1Sa16_13="Then Samuel took the bottle of oil, and put the oil on him there among his brothers: and from that day the spirit of the Lord came on David with power. So Samuel went back to Ramah.";
B._1Sa16_14="Now the spirit of the Lord had gone from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord was troubling him.";
B._1Sa16_15="And Saul's servants said to him, See now, an evil spirit from God is troubling you.";
B._1Sa16_16="Now give orders to your servants who are here before you to go in search of a man who is an expert player on a corded instrument: and it will be that when the evil spirit from God is on you, he will make music for you on his instrument, and you will get well.";
B._1Sa16_17="And Saul said to his servants, Then get me a man who is an expert player, and make him come to me.";
B._1Sa16_18="Then one of the servants in answer said, I have seen a son of Jesse, the Beth-lehemite, who is expert at playing, and a strong man and a man of war; and he is wise in his words, and pleasing in looks, and the Lord is with him.";
B._1Sa16_19="So Saul sent his servants to Jesse and said, Send me your son David who is with the sheep.";
B._1Sa16_20="And Jesse took five cakes of bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them to Saul by David.";
B._1Sa16_21="And David came to Saul, waiting before him: and he became very dear to Saul, who made him his servant, giving him the care of his arms.";
B._1Sa16_22="And Saul sent to Jesse saying, Let David be with me, for he is pleasing to me.";
B._1Sa16_23="And whenever the evil spirit from God came on Saul, David took his instrument and made music: so new life came to Saul, and he got well, and the evil spirit went away from him.";
B._1Sa17_1="Now the Philistines got their armies together for war, and came together at Socoh in the land of Judah, and took up their position between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim.";
B._1Sa17_2="And Saul and the men of Israel came together and took up their position in the valley of Elah, and put their forces in order against the Philistines.";
B._1Sa17_3="The Philistines were stationed on the mountain on one side and Israel on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.";
B._1Sa17_4="And a fighter came out from the tents of the Philistines, named Goliath of Gath; he was more than six cubits tall.";
B._1Sa17_5="And he had a head-dress of brass on his head, and he was dressed in a coat of metal, the weight of which was five thousand shekels of brass.";
B._1Sa17_6="His legs were covered with plates of brass and hanging on his back was a javelin of brass.";
B._1Sa17_7="The stem of his spear was as long as a cloth-worker's rod, and its head was made of six hundred shekels' weight of iron: and one went before him with his body-cover.";
B._1Sa17_8="He took up his position and in a loud voice said to the armies of Israel, Why have you come out to make war? Am I not a Philistine and you servants of Saul? Send out a man for yourselves and let him come down to me.";
B._1Sa17_9="If he is able to have a fight with me and overcome me, then we will be your servants: but if I am able to overcome him, then you will be our servants and do work for us.";
B._1Sa17_10="And the Philistine said, I have put to shame the armies of Israel this day; give me a man so that we may have a fight together.";
B._1Sa17_11="And Saul and all Israel, hearing those words of the Philistine, were troubled and full of fear.";
B._1Sa17_12="Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah named Jesse, who had eight sons; and he was an old man in Saul's day, and far on in years.";
B._1Sa17_13="And the three oldest sons of Jesse had gone with Saul to the fight: the names of the three who went to the fight were Eliab, the oldest, and Abinadab the second, and Shammah the third.";
B._1Sa17_14="And David was the youngest: and the three oldest were with Saul's army.";
B._1Sa17_15="Now David went to and from Saul, looking after his father's sheep at Beth-lehem.";
B._1Sa17_16="And the Philistine came near every morning and evening for forty days.";
B._1Sa17_17="And Jesse said to his son David, Take now for your brothers an ephah of this dry grain and these ten cakes of bread, and go quickly with them to the tents to your brothers;";
B._1Sa17_18="And take these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and see how your brothers are and come back with a sign to say how they are.";
B._1Sa17_19="Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.";
B._1Sa17_20="And David got up early in the morning, and, giving the sheep into the care of a keeper, took the things and went as Jesse had said; and he came to the lines where the carts were, when the army was going out to the fight giving their war-cry.";
B._1Sa17_21="And Israel and the Philistines had put their forces in position, army against army.";
B._1Sa17_22="And David gave his parcels into the hands of the keeper of the army stores, and went running to the army and came to his brothers to get knowledge about them.";
B._1Sa17_23="And while he was talking to them, the fighter, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came out from the Philistines' lines and said the same words, in David's hearing.";
B._1Sa17_24="And all the men of Israel, when they saw him, went in flight, overcome with fear.";
B._1Sa17_25="And the men of Israel said, Have you seen this man? Clearly he has come out to put shame on Israel: and it is certain that if any man overcomes him, the king will give that man great wealth, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's family free in Israel.";
B._1Sa17_26="And David said to the men near him, What will be done to the man who overcomes this Philistine and takes away the shame from Israel? for who is this Philistine, a man without circumcision, that he has put shame on the armies of the living God?";
B._1Sa17_27="And the people gave him this answer, So it will be done to the man who overcomes him.";
B._1Sa17_28="And Eliab, his oldest brother, hearing what David said to the men, was moved to wrath against David, and said, Why have you come here? Into whose care have you given that little flock of sheep in the waste land? I have knowledge of your pride and the evil of your heart, you have come down to see the fight.";
