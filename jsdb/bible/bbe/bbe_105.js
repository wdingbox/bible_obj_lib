B._Isa29_3="And I will make war on you like David, and you will be shut in by earthworks, and I will make towers round you.";
B._Isa29_4="And you will be made low, and your voice will come out of the earth, and your words will be low out of the dust; and your voice will come out of the earth like that of a spirit, making bird-like noises out of the dust.";
B._Isa29_5="And the army of your attackers will be like small dust, and all the cruel ones like dry stems gone before the wind; suddenly it will come about.";
B._Isa29_6="The Lord of armies will come in with thunder and earth-shaking and great noise, with rushing wind and storm, and the flame of burning fire.";
B._Isa29_7="And all the nations making war on Ariel, and all those who are fighting against her and shutting her in with their towers, will be like a dream, like a vision of the night.";
B._Isa29_8="And it will be like a man desiring food, and dreaming that he is feasting; but when he is awake there is nothing in his mouth: or like a man in need of water, dreaming that he is drinking; but when he is awake he is feeble and his soul is full of desire: so will all the nations be which make war on Mount Zion.";
B._Isa29_9="Be surprised and full of wonder; let your eyes be covered and be blind: be overcome, but not with wine; go with uncertain steps, but not because of strong drink.";
B._Isa29_10="For the Lord has sent on you a spirit of deep sleep; and by him your eyes, the prophets, are shut, and your heads, the seers, are covered.";
B._Isa29_11="And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book which is shut, which men give to one who has knowledge of writing, saying, Make clear to us what is in the book: and he says, I am not able to, for the book is shut:";
B._Isa29_12="And they give it to one without learning, saying, Make clear to us what is in the book: and he says, I have no knowledge of writing.";
B._Isa29_13="And the Lord said, because this people come near to me with their mouths, and give honour to me with their lips, but their heart is far from me, and their fear of me is false, a rule given them by the teaching of men;";

B._Isa31_1="Cursed are those who go down to Egypt for help, and who put their faith in horses; looking to war-carriages for salvation, because of their numbers; and to horsemen, because they are very strong; but they are not looking to the Holy One of Israel, or turning their hearts to the Lord;";
B._Isa31_2="Though he is wise, and able to send evil, and his purpose will not be changed; but he will go against the house of the evil-doers, and against those to whom they are looking for help.";
B._Isa31_3="For the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses are flesh, and not spirit: and when the Lord's hand is stretched out, the helper and he who is helped will come down together.";
B._Isa31_4="For the Lord has said to me, As a lion, or a young lion, makes an angry noise over his food, and if a band of herdsmen come out against him, he will not be in fear of their voices, or give up his food for their noise: so the Lord of armies will come down to make war against Mount Zion and its hill.";

B._Isa32_5="The foolish man will no longer be named noble, and they will not say of the false man that he is a man of honour.";
B._Isa32_6="For the foolish man will say foolish things, having evil thoughts in his heart, working what is unclean, and talking falsely about the Lord, to keep food from him who is in need of it, and water from him whose soul is desiring it.";
B._Isa32_7="The designs of the false are evil, purposing the destruction of the poor man by false words, even when he is in the right.";
B._Isa32_8="But the noble-hearted man has noble purposes, and by these he will be guided.";

B._Isa32_11="Be shaking with fear, you women who are living in comfort; be troubled, you who have no fear of danger: take off your robes and put on clothing of grief.";
B._Isa32_12="Have sorrow for the fields, the pleasing fields, the fertile vine;";
B._Isa32_13="And for the land of my people, where thorns will come up; even for all the houses of joy in the glad town.";
B._Isa32_14="For the fair houses will have no man living in them; the town which was full of noise will become a waste; the hill and the watchtower will be unpeopled for ever, a joy for the asses of the woods, a place of food for the flocks;";
B._Isa32_15="Till the spirit comes on us from on high, and the waste land becomes a fertile field, and the fertile field is changed into a wood.";
B._Isa32_16="Then in the waste land there will be an upright rule, and righteousness will have its place in the fertile field.";
B._Isa32_17="And the work of righteousness will be peace; and the effect of an upright rule will be to take away fear for ever.";
B._Isa32_18="And my people will be living in peace, in houses where there is no fear, and in quiet resting-places.";
B._Isa32_19="But the tall trees will come down with a great fall, and the town will be low in a low place.";

B._Isa33_1="Ho! you who make waste those who did not make you waste; acting falsely to those who were not false to you. When you have come to an end of wasting, you will be made waste, and after your false acts, they will do the same to you.";
B._Isa33_2="O Lord, have mercy on us; for we have been waiting for your help: be our strength every morning, our salvation in time of trouble.";
B._Isa33_3="At the loud noise the peoples have gone in flight; at your coming up the nations have gone in all directions.";

B._Isa33_5="The Lord is lifted up; his place is on high: he has made Zion full of righteousness and true religion.";
B._Isa33_6="And she will have no more fear of change, being full of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge: the fear of the Lord is her wealth.";
B._Isa33_7="See, the men of war are sorrowing outside the town: those who came looking for peace are weeping bitterly.";
B._Isa33_8="The highways are waste, no man is journeying there: the agreement is broken, he has made sport of the towns, he has no thought for man.";
B._Isa33_9="The earth is sorrowing and wasting away; Lebanon is put to shame and has become waste; Sharon is like the Arabah; and in Bashan and Carmel the leaves are falling.";
B._Isa33_10="Now will I come forward, says the Lord; now will I be lifted up; now will my power be seen.";
B._Isa33_11="Your designs will be without profit, and their effect will be nothing: you will be burned up by the fire of my breath.";
B._Isa33_12="And the peoples will be like the burning of chalk: as thorns cut down, which are burned in the fire.";

B._Isa33_17="Your eyes will see the king in his glory: they will be looking on a far-stretching land.";
B._Isa33_18="Your heart will give thought to the cause of your fear: where is the scribe, where is he who made a record of the payments, where is he by whom the towers were numbered?";
B._Isa33_19="Never again will you see the cruel people, a people whose tongue has no sense for you; whose language is strange to you.";
B._Isa33_20="Let your eyes be resting on Zion, the town of our holy feasts: you will see Jerusalem, a quiet resting-place, a tent which will not be moved, whose tent-pins will never be pulled up, and whose cords will never be broken.";
B._Isa33_21="But there the Lord will be with us in his glory, ... wide rivers and streams; where no boat will go with blades, and no fair ship will be sailing.";

B._Isa34_6="The sword of the Lord is full of blood, it is fat with the best of the meat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the best parts of the sheep: for the Lord has a feast in Bozrah, and much cattle will be put to death in the land of Edom.";

B._Isa36_6="See, you are basing your hope on that broken rod of Egypt, which will go into a man's hand if he makes use of it for a support; for so is Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to all who put their faith in him.";
B._Isa36_7="And if you say to me, Our hope is in the Lord our God; is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away, saying to Judah and Jerusalem that worship may only be given before this altar?";
B._Isa36_8="And now, take a chance with my master, the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able to put horsemen on them.";
