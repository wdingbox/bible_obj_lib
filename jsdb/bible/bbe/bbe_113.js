B._Jer16_16="See, I will send for great numbers of fishermen, says the Lord, and they will take them like fish in a net; and after that, I will send for numbers of bowmen, and they will go after them, driving them from every mountain and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.";
B._Jer16_17="For my eyes are on all their ways: there is no cover for them from my face, and their evil-doing is not kept secret from my eyes.";
B._Jer16_18="And I will give them the reward of their evil-doing and their sin twice over; because they have made my land unclean, and have made my heritage full of the bodies of their unholy and disgusting things.";
B._Jer16_19="O Lord, my strength and my strong tower, my safe place in the day of trouble, the nations will come to you from the ends of the earth, and say, The heritage of our fathers is nothing but deceit, even false things in which there is no profit.";

B._Jer17_3="I will give your wealth and all your stores to be taken away in war without a price, because of your sins in every part of your land.";
B._Jer17_4="And your hand will have to let go your heritage which I gave you; and I will make you a servant to your haters in a land which is strange to you: for you have put my wrath on fire with a flame which will go on burning for ever.";
B._Jer17_5="This is what the Lord has said: Cursed is the man who puts his faith in man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart is turned away from the Lord.";
B._Jer17_6="For he will be like the brushwood in the upland, and will not see when good comes; but his living-place will be in the dry places in the waste land, in a salt and unpeopled land.";
B._Jer17_7="A blessing is on the man who puts his faith in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.";
B._Jer17_8="For he will be like a tree planted by the waters, pushing out its roots by the stream; he will have no fear when the heat comes, but his leaf will be green; in a dry year he will have no care, and will go on giving fruit.";
B._Jer17_9="The heart is a twisted thing, not to be searched out by man: who is able to have knowledge of it?";
B._Jer17_10="I the Lord am the searcher of the heart, the tester of the thoughts, so that I may give to every man the reward of his ways, in keeping with the fruit of his doings.";

B._Jer17_18="Let them be put to shame who are attacking me, but let me not be shamed; let them be overcome with fear, but let me not be overcome: send on them the day of evil, and put them to destruction twice over.";

B._Jer17_27="But if you do not give ear to me, to keep the Sabbath day holy, and to let no weight be lifted and taken through the doors of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day: then I will put a fire in its doorways, burning up the great houses of Jerusalem, and it will never be put out.";
B._Jer18_1="The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,";
B._Jer18_2="Up! go down to the potter's house, and there I will let my words come to your ears.";
B._Jer18_3="Then I went down to the potter's house, and he was doing his work on the stones.";
B._Jer18_4="And when the vessel, which he was forming out of earth, got damaged in the hand of the potter, he made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make it.";

B._Jer18_8="If, in that very minute, that nation of which I was talking is turned away from its evil, my purpose of doing evil to them will be changed.";
B._Jer18_9="And whenever I say anything about building up a nation or a kingdom, and planting it;";
B._Jer18_10="If, in that very minute, it does evil in my eyes, going against my orders, then my good purpose, which I said I would do for them, will be changed.";
B._Jer18_11="Now, then, say to the men of Judah and to the people of Jerusalem, This is what the Lord has said: See, I am forming an evil thing against you, and designing a design against you: let every man come back now from his evil way, and let your ways and your doings be changed for the better.";
B._Jer18_12="But they will say, There is no hope: we will go on in our designs, and every one of us will do what he is moved by the pride of his evil heart to do.";

B._Jer19_13="And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which they have made unclean, will be like the place of Topheth, even all the houses on whose roofs perfumes have been burned to all the army of heaven, and drink offerings drained out to other gods.";
B._Jer19_14="Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the Lord had sent him to give the prophet's word; and he took his place in the open square of the Lord's house, and said to all the people,";
B._Jer19_15="The Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: See, I will send on this town and on all her towns all the evil which I have said; because they made their necks stiff, so that they might not give ear to my words.";
B._Jer20_1="Now it came to the ears of Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief in authority in the house of the Lord, that Jeremiah was saying these things;";
B._Jer20_2="And Pashhur gave blows to Jeremiah and had his feet chained in a framework of wood in the higher doorway of Benjamin, which was in the house of the Lord.";
B._Jer20_3="Then on the day after, Pashhur let Jeremiah loose. Then Jeremiah said to him, The Lord has given you the name of Magor-missabib (Cause-of-fear-on-every-side), not Pashhur.";

B._Jer20_5="And more than this, I will give all the wealth of this town and all its profits and all its things of value, even all the stores of the kings of Judah will I give into the hands of their haters, who will put violent hands on them and take them away to Babylon.";
B._Jer20_6="And you, Pashhur, and all who are in your house, will go away prisoners: you will come to Babylon, and there your body will be put to rest, you and all your friends, to whom you said false words.";
B._Jer20_7="O Lord, you have been false to me, and I was tricked; you are stronger than I, and have overcome me: I have become a thing to be laughed at all the day, everyone makes sport of me.";
B._Jer20_8="For every word I say is a cry for help; I say with a loud voice, Violent behaviour and wasting: because the word of the Lord is made a shame to me and a cause of laughing all the day.";
B._Jer20_9="And if I say, I will not keep him in mind, I will not say another word in his name; then it is in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am tired of keeping myself in, I am not able to do it.";

B._Jer20_16="May that man be like the towns overturned by the Lord without mercy: let a cry for help come to his ears in the morning, and the sound of war in the middle of the day;";
B._Jer20_17="Because he did not put me to death before my birth took place: so my mother's body would have been my last resting-place, and she would have been with child for ever.";
