B._Isa36_13="Then the Rab-shakeh got up and said with a loud voice in the Jews' language, Give ear to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria:";
B._Isa36_14="This is what the king says: Do not be tricked by Hezekiah, for there is no salvation for you in him.";
B._Isa36_15="And do not let Hezekiah make you put your faith in the Lord, saying, The Lord will certainly keep us safe, and this town will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.";
B._Isa36_16="Do not give ear to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says, Make peace with me, and come out to me; and everyone will be free to take the fruit of his vine and of his fig-tree, and the water of his spring;";

B._Isa36_20="Who among all the gods of these countries have kept their country from falling into my hand, to give cause for the thought that the Lord will keep Jerusalem from falling into my hand?";
B._Isa36_21="But they kept quiet and gave him no answer: for the king's order was, Give him no answer.";
B._Isa36_22="Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothing parted as a sign of grief, and gave him an account of what the Rab-shakeh had said.";
B._Isa37_1="And on hearing it Hezekiah took off his robe and put on haircloth and went into the house of the Lord.";

B._Isa37_18="Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have made waste all the nations and their lands,";
B._Isa37_19="And have given their gods to the fire: for they were no gods, but wood and stone, the work of men's hands; so they have given them to destruction.";
B._Isa37_20="But now, O Lord our God, give us salvation from his hand, so that it may be clear to all the kingdoms of the earth that you, and you only, are the Lord.";
B._Isa37_21="Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent to Hezekiah, saying, The Lord, the God of Israel, says, The prayer you have made to me against Sennacherib, king of Assyria, has come to my ears.";
B._Isa37_22="This is the word which the Lord has said about him: In the eyes of the virgin daughter of Zion you are shamed and laughed at; the daughter of Jerusalem has made sport of you.";
B._Isa37_23="Against whom have you said evil and bitter things? and against whom has your voice been loud and your eyes lifted up? even against the Holy One of Israel.";
B._Isa37_24="You have sent your servants with evil words against the Lord, and have said, With all my war-carriages I have come up to the top of the mountains, to the inmost parts of Lebanon; and its tall cedars will be cut down, and the best trees of its woods: I will come up into his highest places, into his thick woods.";
B._Isa37_25="I have made water-holes and taken their waters, and with my foot I have made all the rivers of Egypt dry.";
B._Isa37_26="Has it not come to your ears how I did it long before, purposing it in times long past? Now I have given effect to my design, so that by you strong towns might be turned into masses of broken walls.";
B._Isa37_27="This is why their townsmen had no power, they were broken and put to shame; they were like the grass of the field, or a green plant; like the grass on the house-tops, which a cold wind makes waste.";
B._Isa37_28="But I have knowledge of your getting up and your resting, of your going out and your coming in.";
B._Isa37_29="Because your wrath against me and your pride have come to my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my cord in your lips, and I will make you go back by the way you came.";
B._Isa37_30="And this will be the sign to you: you will get your food this year from what comes up of itself, and in the second year from the produce of the same; and in the third year you will put in your seed, and get in the grain, and make vine-gardens, and take of their fruit.";
B._Isa37_31="And those of Judah who are still living will again take root in the earth, and give fruit.";
B._Isa37_32="For from Jerusalem those who have been kept safe will go out, and those who are still living will go out of Mount Zion: by the fixed purpose of the Lord of armies this will be done.";
B._Isa37_33="For this cause the Lord says about the king of Assyria, He will not come into this town, or send an arrow against it; he will not come before it with arms, or put up an earthwork against it.";
B._Isa37_34="By the way he came he will go back, and he will not get into this town.";
