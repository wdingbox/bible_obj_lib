B._Jhn14_29="And now I have given you word of it before it comes, so that, when it comes, you may have faith.";
B._Jhn14_30="After this I will not say much to you, because the ruler of this world comes: and he has no power over me;";
B._Jhn14_31="But he comes so that the world may see that I have love for the Father, and that I am doing as I am ordered by the Father. Get up, and let us go.";
B._Jhn15_1="I am the true vine and my Father is the gardener.";
B._Jhn15_2="He takes away every branch in me which has no fruit, and every branch which has fruit he makes clean, so that it may have more fruit.";
B._Jhn15_3="You are clean, even now, through the teaching which I have given you.";
B._Jhn15_4="Be in me at all times as I am in you. As the branch is not able to give fruit of itself, if it is not still on the vine, so you are not able to do so if you are not in me.";
B._Jhn15_5="I am the vine, you are the branches: he who is in me at all times as I am in him, gives much fruit, because without me you are able to do nothing.";
B._Jhn15_6="If a man does not keep himself in me, he becomes dead and is cut off like a dry branch; such branches are taken up and put in the fire and burned.";
B._Jhn15_7="If you are in me at all times, and my words are in you, then anything for which you make a request will be done for you.";
B._Jhn15_8="Here is my Father's glory, in that you give much fruit and so are my true disciples.";
B._Jhn15_9="Even as the Father has given me his love, so I have given my love to you: be ever in my love.";
B._Jhn15_10="If you keep my laws, you will be ever in my love, even as I have kept my Father's laws, and am ever in his love.";
B._Jhn15_11="I have said these things to you so that I may have joy in you and so that your joy may be complete.";
B._Jhn15_12="This is the law I give you: Have love one for another, even as I have love for you.";
B._Jhn15_13="Greater love has no man than this, that a man gives up his life for his friends.";
B._Jhn15_14="You are my friends, if you do what I give you orders to do.";
B._Jhn15_15="No longer do I give you the name of servants; because a servant is without knowledge of what his master is doing: I give you the name of friends, because I have given you knowledge of all the things which my Father has said to me.";
B._Jhn15_16="You did not take me for yourselves, but I took you for myself; and I gave you the work of going about and producing fruit which will be for ever; so that whatever request you make to the Father in my name he may give it to you.";
B._Jhn15_17="So this is my law for you: Have love one for another.";
B._Jhn15_18="If you are hated by the world, keep in mind that I was hated by the world before you.";
B._Jhn15_19="If you were of the world, you would be loved by the world: but because you are not of the world, but I have taken you out of the world, you are hated by the world.";
B._Jhn15_20="Keep in mind the words I said to you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they were cruel to me, they will be cruel to you; if they kept my words, they will keep yours.";
B._Jhn15_21="They will do all this to you because of my name--because they have no knowledge of him who sent me.";
B._Jhn15_22="If I had not come and been their teacher they would have had no sin: but now they have no reason to give for their sin.";
B._Jhn15_23="He who has hate for me has hate for my Father.";
B._Jhn15_24="If I had not done among them the works which no other man ever did, they would have had no sin: but now they have seen, and they have had hate in their hearts for me and my Father.";
B._Jhn15_25="This comes about so that the writing in their law may be made true, Their hate for me was without cause.";
B._Jhn15_26="When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father even the Spirit of true knowledge who comes from the Father--he will give witness about me;";
B._Jhn15_27="And you, in addition, will give witness because you have been with me from the first.";
B._Jhn16_1="I have said these things to you so that you may not be in doubt.";
B._Jhn16_2="They will put you out of the Synagogues: yes, the time is coming when whoever puts you to death will have the belief that he is doing God's pleasure.";
B._Jhn16_3="They will do these things to you because they have not had knowledge of the Father or of me.";
B._Jhn16_4="I have said these things to you so that when the time comes, what I have said may come to your mind. I did not say them to you at the first, because then I was still with you.";
B._Jhn16_5="But now I am going to him who sent me; and not one of you says to me, Where are you going?";
B._Jhn16_6="But your hearts are full of sorrow because I have said these things.";
B._Jhn16_7="But what I am saying is true: my going is for your good: for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.";
B._Jhn16_8="And he, when he comes, will make the world conscious of sin, and of righteousness, and of being judged:";
B._Jhn16_9="Of sin, because they have not faith in me;";
B._Jhn16_10="Of righteousness, because I go to the Father and you will see me no more;";
B._Jhn16_11="Of being judged, because the ruler of this world has been judged.";
B._Jhn16_12="I have still much to say to you, but you are not strong enough for it now.";
B._Jhn16_13="However, when he, the Spirit of true knowledge, has come, he will be your guide into all true knowledge: for his words will not come from himself, but whatever has come to his hearing, that he will say: and he will make clear to you the things to come.";
B._Jhn16_14="He will give me glory, because he will take of what is mine, and make it clear to you.";
B._Jhn16_15="Everything which the Father has is mine: that is why I say, He will take of what is mine and will make it clear to you.";
B._Jhn16_16="After a little time you will see me no longer; and then again, after a little time, you will see me.";
B._Jhn16_17="So some of the disciples said one to another, What is this he is saying, After a little time, you will see me no longer; and then again, after a little time, you will see me? and, I am going to the Father?";
B._Jhn16_18="So they said again and again, What is this he is saying, A little time? His words are not clear to us.";
B._Jhn16_19="Jesus saw that they had a desire to put the question to him, so he said to them, Is this what you are questioning one with another, why I said, After a little time, you will see me no longer; and then again, after a little time, you will see me?";
B._Jhn16_20="Truly I say to you, You will be weeping and sorrowing, but the world will be glad: you will be sad, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.";
B._Jhn16_21="When a woman is about to give birth she has sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she has given birth to the child, the pain is put out of her mind by the joy that a man has come into the world.";
B._Jhn16_22="So you have sorrow now: but I will see you again, and your hearts will be glad, and no one will take away your joy.";
B._Jhn16_23="And on that day you will put no questions to me. Truly I say to you, Whatever request you make to the Father, he will give it to you in my name.";
B._Jhn16_24="Up to now you have made no request in my name: do so, and it will be answered, so that your hearts may be full of joy.";
B._Jhn16_25="All this I have said to you in veiled language: but the time is coming when I will no longer say things in veiled language but will give you knowledge of the Father clearly.";
B._Jhn16_26="In that day you will make requests in my name: and I do not say that I will make prayer to the Father for you,";
B._Jhn16_27="For the Father himself gives his love to you, because you have given your love to me and have had faith that I came from God.";
B._Jhn16_28="I came out from the Father and have come into the world: again, I go away from the world and go to the Father.";
B._Jhn16_29="His disciples said, Now you are talking clearly and not in veiled language.";
B._Jhn16_30="Now we are certain that you have knowledge of all things and have no need for anyone to put questions to you: through this we have faith that you came from God.";
B._Jhn16_31="Jesus made answer, Have you faith now?";
B._Jhn16_32="See, a time is coming, yes, it is now here, when you will go away in all directions, every man to his house, and I will be by myself: but I am not by myself, because the Father is with me.";
B._Jhn16_33="I have said all these things to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you have trouble: but take heart! I have overcome the world.";
B._Jhn17_1="Jesus said these things; then, lifting his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the time has now come; give glory to your Son, so that the Son may give glory to you:";
B._Jhn17_2="Even as you gave him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all those whom you have given to him.";
B._Jhn17_3="And this is eternal life: to have knowledge of you, the only true God, and of him whom you have sent, even Jesus Christ.";
B._Jhn17_4="I have given you glory on the earth, having done all the work which you gave me to do.";
B._Jhn17_5="And now, Father, let me have glory with you, even that glory which I had with you before the world was.";
B._Jhn17_6="I have given knowledge of your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world: yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your words.";
B._Jhn17_7="Now it is clear to them that whatever you have given to me comes from you:";
B._Jhn17_8="Because I have given them the words which you gave to me; and they have taken them to heart, and have certain knowledge that I came from you, and they have faith that you sent me.";
B._Jhn17_9="My prayer is for them: my prayer is not for the world, but for those whom you have given to me, because they are yours";
B._Jhn17_10="(All mine are yours, and yours are mine) and I have glory in them.";
B._Jhn17_11="And now I will be no longer in the world, but they are in the world and I come to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name which you have given to me, so that they may be one even as we are one.";
B._Jhn17_12="While I was with them I kept them safe in your name which you have given to me: I took care of them and not one of them has come to destruction, but only the son of destruction, so that the Writings might come true.";
B._Jhn17_13="And now I come to you; and these things I say in the world so that they may have my joy complete in them.";
B._Jhn17_14="I have given your word to them; and they are hated by the world, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.";
B._Jhn17_15="My prayer is not that you will take them out of the world, but that you will keep them from the Evil One.";
B._Jhn17_16="They are not of the world any more than I am of the world.";
B._Jhn17_17="Make them holy by the true word: your word is the true word.";
B._Jhn17_18="Even as you have sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.";
B._Jhn17_19="And for them I make myself holy, so that they may be made truly holy.";
B._Jhn17_20="My prayer is not for them only, but for all who will have faith in me through their word;";
B._Jhn17_21="May they all be one! Even as you, Father, are in me and I am in you, so let them be in us, so that all men may come to have faith that you sent me.";
B._Jhn17_22="And the glory which you have given to me I have given to them, so that they may be one even as we are one;";
B._Jhn17_23="I in them, and you in me, so that they may be made completely one, and so that it may become clear to all men that you have sent me and that they are loved by you as I am loved by you.";
B._Jhn17_24="Father, it is my desire that these whom you have given to me may be by my side where I am, so that they may see my glory which you have given to me, because you had love for me before the world came into being.";
B._Jhn17_25="Father of righteousness, I have knowledge of you, though the world has not; and to these it is clear that you sent me;";
B._Jhn17_26="And I have given to them knowledge of your name, and will give it, so that the love which you have for me may be in them and I in them.";
B._Jhn18_1="When Jesus had said these words he went out with his disciples over the stream Kedron to a garden, into which he went with his disciples.";
B._Jhn18_2="And Judas, who was false to him, had knowledge of the place because Jesus went there frequently with his disciples.";
B._Jhn18_3="So Judas, getting a band of armed men and police from the chief priests and Pharisees, went there with lights and with arms.";
B._Jhn18_4="Then Jesus, having knowledge of everything which was coming on him, went forward and said to them, Who are you looking for?";
B._Jhn18_5="Their answer was, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus said, I am he. And Judas, who was false to him, was there at their side.";
B._Jhn18_6="And when he said to them, I am he, they went back, falling to the earth.";
B._Jhn18_7="So again he put the question to them, Who are you looking for? And they said, Jesus the Nazarene.";
B._Jhn18_8="Jesus made answer, I have said that I am he; if you are looking for me, let these men go away.";
B._Jhn18_9="(He said this so that his words might come true, I have kept safe all those whom you gave to me.)";
B._Jhn18_10="Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, took it out and gave the high priest's servant a blow, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.";
B._Jhn18_11="Then Jesus said to Peter, Put back your sword: am I not to take the cup which my Father has given to me?";
B._Jhn18_12="Then the band and the chief captain and the police took Jesus and put cords round him.";
B._Jhn18_13="They took him first to Annas, because Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was the high priest that year.";
B._Jhn18_14="It was Caiaphas who had said to the Jews that it was in their interest for one man to be put to death for the people.";
B._Jhn18_15="And Simon Peter went after Jesus with another disciple. Now that disciple was a friend of the high priest and he went in with Jesus into the house of the high priest;";
B._Jhn18_16="But Peter was kept outside at the door. Then this other disciple, who was a friend of the high priest, came out and had a word with the girl who kept the door, and took Peter in.";
B._Jhn18_17="Then the girl who was the door-keeper said to Peter, Are you not one of this man's disciples? In answer he said, I am not.";
B._Jhn18_18="Now the servants and the police had made a fire of coals because it was cold; they were warming themselves in front of it and Peter was there with them, warming himself.";
B._Jhn18_19="Then the high priest put questions to Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.";
B._Jhn18_20="Jesus made answer, I said things openly to the world at all times; I have given my teaching in the Synagogues and in the Temple to which all the Jews come; and I have said nothing secretly.";
B._Jhn18_21="Why are you questioning me? put questions to my hearers about what I have said to them: they have knowledge of what I said.";
B._Jhn18_22="When he said this, one of the police by his side gave him a blow with his open hand, saying, Do you give such an answer to the high priest?";
B._Jhn18_23="Jesus said in answer, If I have said anything evil, give witness to the evil: but if I said what is true, why do you give me blows?";
B._Jhn18_24="Then Annas sent him chained to Caiaphas, the high priest.";
B._Jhn18_25="But Simon Peter was still there warming himself by the fire. They said to him, Are you not one of his disciples? He said, No, I am not.";
B._Jhn18_26="One of the servants of the high priest, a relation of him whose ear had been cut off by Peter, said, Did I not see you with him in the garden?";
B._Jhn18_27="Then again Peter said, No. And straight away a cock gave its cry.";
B._Jhn18_28="So they took Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the Praetorium. It was early. They themselves did not go into the Praetorium, so that they might not become unclean, but might take the Passover.";
B._Jhn18_29="So Pilate came out to them and put the question: What have you to say against this man?";
B._Jhn18_30="They said to him in answer, If the man was not a wrongdoer we would not have given him up to you.";
B._Jhn18_31="Then Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and let him be judged by your law. But the Jews said to him, We have no right to put any man to death.";
B._Jhn18_32="(That the word of Jesus might come true, pointing to the sort of death he would have.)";
B._Jhn18_33="Then Pilate went back into the Praetorium and sent for Jesus and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?";
B._Jhn18_34="Jesus made answer, Do you say this of yourself, or did others say it about me?";
B._Jhn18_35="Pilate said, Am I a Jew? Your nation and the chief priests have given you into my hands: what have you done?";
B._Jhn18_36="Jesus said in answer, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom was of this world, my disciples would have made a good fight to keep me out of the hands of the Jews: but my kingdom is not here.";
B._Jhn18_37="Then Pilate said to him, Are you then a king? Jesus made answer, You say that I am a king. For this purpose was I given birth, and for this purpose I came into the world, that I might give witness to what is true. Every lover of what is true gives ear to my voice.";
B._Jhn18_38="Pilate said to him, True? what is true? Having said this he went out again to the Jews and said to them, I see no wrong in him.";
B._Jhn18_39="But every year you make a request to me to let a prisoner go free at the Passover. Is it your desire that I let the King of the Jews go free?";
B._Jhn18_40="Then again they gave a loud cry, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was an outlaw.";
B._Jhn19_1="Then Pilate took Jesus and had him whipped with cords.";
B._Jhn19_2="And the men of the army made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a purple robe on him.";
B._Jhn19_3="And they kept coming and saying, Long life to the King of the Jews! And they gave him blows with their hands.";
B._Jhn19_4="And Pilate went out again and said to them, See, I let him come out to you to make it clear to you that I see no wrong in him.";
B._Jhn19_5="Then Jesus came out with the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, Here is the man!";
B._Jhn19_6="So when the chief priests and the police saw him they gave a loud cry, To the cross! to the cross! Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and put him on the cross: I see no crime in him.";
B._Jhn19_7="And the Jews made answer, We have a law, and by that law it is right for him to be put to death because he said he was the Son of God.";
B._Jhn19_8="When this saying came to Pilate's ears his fear became greater;";
B._Jhn19_9="And he went again into the Praetorium and said to Jesus, Where do you come from? But Jesus gave him no answer.";
B._Jhn19_10="Then Pilate said to him, You say nothing to me? is it not clear to you that I have power to let you go free and power to put you to death on the cross?";
B._Jhn19_11="Jesus gave this answer: You would have no power at all over me if it was not given to you by God; so that he who gave me up to you has the greater sin.";
B._Jhn19_12="Hearing this, Pilate had a desire to let him go free, but the Jews said in a loud voice, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: everyone who makes himself a king goes against Caesar.";
B._Jhn19_13="So when these words came to Pilate's ear, he took Jesus out, seating himself in the judge's seat in a place named in Hebrew, Gabbatha, or the Stone Floor.";
B._Jhn19_14="(It was the day when they made ready for the Passover; and it was about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, There is your King!";
B._Jhn19_15="Then they gave a loud cry, Away with him! away with him! to the cross! Pilate said to them, Am I to put your King to death on the cross? The chief priests said in answer, We have no king but Caesar.";
B._Jhn19_16="So then he gave him up to them to be put to death on the cross. And they took Jesus away;";
B._Jhn19_17="And he went out with his cross on him to the place which is named Dead Man's Head (in Hebrew, Golgotha):";
B._Jhn19_18="Where they put him on the cross with two others, one on this side and one on that, and Jesus in the middle.";
B._Jhn19_19="And Pilate put on the cross a statement in writing. The writing was: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.";
B._Jhn19_20="The writing was seen by a number of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was put to death on the cross was near the town; and the writing was in Hebrew and Latin and Greek.";
B._Jhn19_21="Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not put, The King of the Jews, but, He said, I am the King of the Jews.";
B._Jhn19_22="But Pilate made answer, What I have put in writing will not be changed.";
B._Jhn19_23="And when Jesus was nailed to the cross, the men of the army took his clothing, and made a division of it into four parts, to every man a part, and they took his coat: now the coat was without a join, made out of one bit of cloth.";
B._Jhn19_24="So they said among themselves, Let this not be cut up, but let us put it to the decision of chance and see who gets it. (They did this so that the Writings might come true, which say, They made a distribution of my clothing among them, and my coat they put to the decision of chance.) This was what the men of the army did.";
B._Jhn19_25="Now by the side of the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister Mary, the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.";
B._Jhn19_26="So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple who was dear to him, he said to his mother, Mother, there is your son!";
B._Jhn19_27="Then he said to the disciple, There is your mother! And from that hour the disciple took her to his house.";
B._Jhn19_28="After this, being conscious that all things had now been done so that the Writings might come true, Jesus said, Give me water.";
B._Jhn19_29="Now there was a vessel ready, full of bitter wine, and they put a sponge full of it on a stick and put it to his mouth.";
B._Jhn19_30="So when Jesus had taken the wine he said, All is done. And with his head bent he gave up his spirit.";
B._Jhn19_31="Now it was the day of getting ready for the Passover, and so that the bodies might not be on the cross on the Sabbath (because the day of that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews made a request to Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.";
B._Jhn19_32="So the men of the army came, and the legs of the first were broken and then of the other who was put to death on the cross with Jesus:";
B._Jhn19_33="But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead by this time, and so his legs were not broken;";
B._Jhn19_34="But one of the men made a wound in his side with a spear, and straight away there came out blood and water.";
B._Jhn19_35="And he who saw it has given witness (and his witness is true; he is certain that what he says is true) so that you may have belief.";
B._Jhn19_36="These things came about so that the Writings might be true, No bone of his body will be broken.";
B._Jhn19_37="And again another verse says, They will see him who was wounded by their spears.";
B._Jhn19_38="After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, made a request to Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate said he might do so. So he went and took away his body.";
B._Jhn19_39="And Nicodemus came (he who had first come to Jesus by night) with a roll of myrrh and aloes mixed, about a hundred pounds.";
B._Jhn19_40="Then they took the body of Jesus, folding linen about it with the spices, as is the way of the Jews when they put the dead to rest.";
B._Jhn19_41="Now there was a garden near the cross, and in the garden a new place for the dead in which no man had ever been put.";
B._Jhn19_42="So they put Jesus there, because it was the Jews' day of getting ready for the Passover, and the place was near.";
B._Jhn20_1="Now on the first day of the week, very early, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the place and saw that the stone had been taken away from it.";
B._Jhn20_2="Then she went running to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple who was loved by Jesus, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the place of the dead and we have no knowledge where they have put him.";
B._Jhn20_3="So Peter and the other disciple went out to the place of the dead.";
B._Jhn20_4="They went running together, and the other disciple got in front of Peter and came first to the hole in the rock;";
B._Jhn20_5="And looking in, he saw the linen bands on the earth; but he did not go in,";
B._Jhn20_6="Then Simon Peter came after him and went into the hole in the rock; and he saw the linen bands on the earth,";
B._Jhn20_7="And the cloth, which had been round his head, not with the linen bands but rolled up in a place by itself.";
B._Jhn20_8="Then the other disciple who came there first went in; and he saw and belief came to him.";
B._Jhn20_9="For at that time they had no knowledge that the Writings said that he would have to come again from the dead.";
