B._Isa57_21="There is no peace, says my God, for the evil-doers.";
B._Isa58_1="Make a loud cry, do not be quiet, let your voice be sounding like a horn, and make clear to my people their evil doings, and to the family of Jacob their sins.";
B._Isa58_2="Though they make prayer to me every day, and take pleasure in the knowledge of my ways: like a nation which has done righteousness, and has not given up the rules of their God, they make requests to me for the right orders, it is their delight to come near to God.";
B._Isa58_3="They say, Why have we kept ourselves from food, and you do not see it? why have we kept ourselves from pleasure, and you take no note of it? If, in the days when you keep from food, you take the chance to do your business, and get in your debts;";
B._Isa58_4="If keeping from food makes you quickly angry, ready for fighting and giving blows with evil hands; your holy days are not such as to make your voice come to my ears on high.";
B._Isa58_5="Have I given orders for such a day as this? a day for keeping yourselves from pleasure? is it only a question of the bent head, of putting on haircloth, and being seated in the dust? is this what seems to you a holy day, well-pleasing to the Lord?";
B._Isa58_6="Is not this the holy day for which I have given orders: to let loose those who have wrongly been made prisoners, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the crushed go free, and every yoke be broken?";
B._Isa58_7="Is it not to give your bread to those in need, and to let the poor who have no resting-place come into your house? to put a robe on the unclothed one when you see him, and not to keep your eyes shut for fear of seeing his flesh?";
B._Isa58_8="Then will light be shining on you like the morning, and your wounds will quickly be well: and your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will come after you.";
B._Isa58_9="Then at the sound of your voice, the Lord will give an answer; at your cry he will say, Here am I. If you take away from among you the yoke, the putting out of the finger of shame, and the evil word;";
B._Isa58_10="And if you give your bread to those in need of it, so that the troubled one may have his desire; then you will have light in the dark, and your night will be as the full light of the sun:";
B._Isa58_11="And the Lord will be your guide at all times; in dry places he will give you water in full measure, and will make strong your bones; and you will be like a watered garden, and like an ever-flowing spring.";
B._Isa58_12="And your sons will be building again the old waste places: you will make strong the bases of old generations: and you will be named, He who puts up the broken walls, and, He who makes ready the ways for use.";
B._Isa58_13="If you keep the Sabbath with care, not doing your business on my holy day; and if the Sabbath seems to you a delight, and the new moon of the Lord a thing to be honoured; and if you give respect to him by not doing your business, or going after your pleasure, or saying unholy words;";
B._Isa58_14="Then the Lord will be your delight; and I will put you on the high places of the earth; and I will give you the heritage of Jacob your father: for the mouth of the Lord has said it.";
B._Isa59_1="Truly, the Lord's hand has not become short, so that he is unable to give salvation; and his ear is not shut from hearing:";
B._Isa59_2="But your sins have come between you and your God, and by your evil doings his face has been veiled from you, so that he will give you no answer.";
B._Isa59_3="For your hands are unclean with blood, and your fingers with sin; your lips have said false things, and your tongue gives out deceit.";
B._Isa59_4="No one puts forward an upright cause, or gives a true decision: their hope is in deceit, and their words are false; they are with child with sin, and give birth to evil.";
B._Isa59_5="They give birth to snake's eggs, and make spider's threads: whoever takes their eggs for food comes to his death, and the egg which is crushed becomes a poison-snake.";
B._Isa59_6="Their twisted threads will not make clothing, and their works will give them nothing for covering themselves: their works are works of sin, and violent acts are in their hands.";
B._Isa59_7="Their feet go quickly to evil, and they take delight in the death of the upright; their thoughts are thoughts of sin; wasting and destruction are in their ways.";
B._Isa59_8="They have no knowledge of the way of peace, and there is no sense of what is right in their behaviour: they have made for themselves ways which are not straight; whoever goes in them has no knowledge of peace.";
B._Isa59_9="For this cause our right is far from us, and righteousness does not overtake us: we are looking for light, but there is only the dark; for the shining of the sun, but our way is in the night.";
B._Isa59_10="We go on our way, like blind men feeling for the wall, even like those who have no eyes: we are running against things in daylight as if it was evening; our place is in the dark like dead men.";
B._Isa59_11="We make noises of grief, like bears, and sad sounds like doves: we are looking for our right, but it is not there; for salvation, but it is far from us.";
B._Isa59_12="For our evil doings are increased before you, and our sins give witness against us: for our evil doings are with us, and we have knowledge of our sins:";
B._Isa59_13="We have gone against the Lord, and been false to him, turning away from our God, our words have been uncontrolled, and in our hearts are thoughts of deceit.";
B._Isa59_14="And the right is turned back, and righteousness is far away: for good faith is not to be seen in the public places, and upright behaviour may not come into the town.";
B._Isa59_15="Yes, faith is gone; and he whose heart is turned from evil comes into the power of the cruel: and the Lord saw it, and he was angry that there was no one to take up their cause.";
B._Isa59_16="And he saw that there was no man, and was surprised that there was no one to take up their cause: so his arm gave salvation, and he made righteousness his support.";
B._Isa59_17="Yes, he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and salvation as a head-dress; and he put on punishment as clothing, and wrath as a robe.";
B._Isa59_18="He will give them the right reward of their doings, wrath to his attackers, punishment to his haters, and even on the sea-lands he will send punishment.";
B._Isa59_19="So they will see the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the east: for he will come like a rushing stream, forced on by a wind of the Lord.";
B._Isa59_20="And as a saviour he will come to Zion, turning away sin from Jacob, says the Lord.";
B._Isa59_21="And as for me, this is my agreement with them, says the Lord: my spirit which is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, will not go away from your mouth, or from the mouth of your seed, or from the mouth of your seed's seed, says the Lord, from now and for ever.";
B._Isa60_1="Up! let your face be bright, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord is shining on you.";
B._Isa60_2="For truly, the earth will be dark, and the peoples veiled in blackest night; but the Lord will be shining on you, and his glory will be seen among you.";
B._Isa60_3="And nations will come to your light, and kings to your bright dawn.";
B._Isa60_4="Let your eyes be lifted up, and see: they are all coming together to you: your sons will come from far, and your daughters taken with loving care.";
B._Isa60_5="Then you will see, and be bright with joy, and your heart will be shaking with increase of delight: for the produce of the sea will be turned to you, the wealth of the nations will come to you.";
B._Isa60_6="You will be full of camel-trains, even the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all from Sheba will come, with gold and spices, giving word of the great acts of the Lord.";
B._Isa60_7="All the flocks of Kedar will come together to you, the sheep of Nebaioth will be ready for your need; they will be pleasing offerings on my altar, and my house of prayer will be beautiful.";
B._Isa60_8="Who are these coming like a cloud, like a flight of doves to their windows?";
B._Isa60_9="Vessels of the sea-lands are waiting for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, so that your sons may come from far, and their silver and gold with them, to the place of the name of the Lord your God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he has made you beautiful.";
B._Isa60_10="And men from strange countries will be building up your walls, and their kings will be your servants: for in my wrath I sent punishment on you, but in my grace I have had mercy on you.";
B._Isa60_11="Your doors will be open at all times; they will not be shut day or night; so that men may come into you with the wealth of the nations, with their kings at their head.";
B._Isa60_12="For the nation or kingdom which will not be your servant will come to destruction; such nations will be completely waste.";
B._Isa60_13="The glory of Lebanon will come to you, the cypress, the plane, and the sherbin-tree together, to make my holy place beautiful; and the resting-place of my feet will be full of glory.";
B._Isa60_14="And the sons of those who were cruel to you will come before you with bent heads; and those who made sport of you will go down on their faces at your feet; and you will be named, The Town of the Lord, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.";
B._Isa60_15="And though you were turned away from, and hated, and had no helper, I will make you a pride for ever, a joy from generation to generation.";
B._Isa60_16="And you will take the milk of the nations, flowing from the breast of kings; and you will see that I, the Lord, am your saviour, and he who takes up your cause, the Strong One of Jacob.";

B._Isa60_19="The sun will not be your light by day, and the moon will no longer be bright for you by night: but the Lord will be to you an eternal light, and your God your glory.";
B._Isa60_20="Your sun will never again go down, or your moon keep back her light: for the Lord will be your eternal light, and the days of your sorrow will be ended.";

B._Isa60_22="The smallest of their families will become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I, the Lord, will make it come quickly in its time.";
B._Isa61_1="The spirit of the Lord is on me, because I am marked out by him to give good news to the poor; he has sent me to make the broken-hearted well, to say that the prisoners will be made free, and that those in chains will see the light again;";
B._Isa61_2="To give knowledge that the year of the Lord's good pleasure has come, and the day of punishment from our God; to give comfort to all who are sad;";
B._Isa61_3="To give them a fair head-dress in place of dust, the oil of joy in place of the clothing of grief, praise in place of sorrow; so that they may be named trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, and so that he may have glory.";
B._Isa61_4="And they will be building again the old broken walls, and will make new the old waste places, and will put up again the towns which have been waste for long generations.";
B._Isa61_5="And men from strange countries will be your herdsmen, and those who are not Israelites will be your ploughmen and vine-keepers.";
B._Isa61_6="But you will be named the priests of the Lord, the servants of our God: you will have the wealth of the nations for your food, and you will be clothed with their glory.";
B._Isa61_7="As they had twice as much grief, and marks of shame were their heritage, so in their land they will be rewarded twice over, and will have eternal joy.";

B._Isa63_1="Who is this who comes from Edom, with blood-red robes from Bozrah? he whose clothing is fair, stepping with pride in his great strength? I whose glory is in the right, strong for salvation.";
B._Isa63_2="Why is your clothing red, and why are your robes like those of one who is crushing the grapes?";
B._Isa63_3="I have been crushing the grapes by myself, and of the peoples there was no man with me: in my wrath and in my passion, they were crushed under my feet; and my robes are marked with their life-blood, and all my clothing is red.";
B._Isa63_4="For the day of punishment is in my heart, and the year for the payment of the price for my people has come.";
B._Isa63_5="And I saw that there was no helper, and I was wondering that no one gave them support: so my arm did the work of salvation, and my wrath was my support.";
B._Isa63_6="And in my passion the peoples were crushed under my feet, and broken in my wrath, and I put down their strength to the earth.";
B._Isa63_7="I will give news of the mercies of the Lord, and his great acts, even all the things the Lord has done for us, in his great grace to the house of Israel; even all he has done for us in his unnumbered mercies.";
B._Isa63_8="For he said, Truly they are my people, children who will not be false: so he was their saviour out of all their trouble.";
B._Isa63_9="It was no sent one or angel, but he himself who was their saviour: in his love and in his pity he took up their cause, and he took them in his arms, caring for them all through the years.";
B._Isa63_10="But they went against him, causing grief to his holy spirit: so he was turned against them, and made war on them.";
B._Isa63_11="Then the early days came to their minds, the days of Moses his servant: and they said, Where is he who made the keeper of his flock come up from the sea? where is he who put his holy spirit among them,";
B._Isa63_12="He who made the arm of his glory go at the right hand of Moses, by whom the waters were parted before them, to make himself an eternal name;";
B._Isa63_13="He who made them go through the deep waters, like a horse in the waste land?";
B._Isa63_14="Like the cattle which go down into the valley, they went without falling, the spirit of the Lord guiding them: so you went before your people, to make yourself a great name.";
B._Isa63_15="Let your eyes be looking down from heaven, from your holy and beautiful house: where is your deep feeling, the working of your power? do not keep back the moving of your pity and your mercies:";
B._Isa63_16="For you are our father, though Abraham has no knowledge of us, and Israel gives no thought to us: you, O Lord, are our father; from the earliest days you have taken up our cause.";
B._Isa63_17="O Lord, why do you send us wandering from your ways, making our hearts hard, so that we have no fear of you? Come back, because of your servants, the tribes of your heritage.";
B._Isa63_18="Why have evil men gone over your holy place, so that it has been crushed under the feet of our haters?";
B._Isa63_19="We have become as those who were never ruled by you, on whom your name was not named.";
B._Isa64_1="O let the heavens be broken open and come down, so that the mountains may be shaking before you,";
B._Isa64_2="As when fire puts the brushwood in flames, or as when water is boiling from the heat of the fire: to make your name feared by your haters, so that the nations may be shaking before you;";
B._Isa64_3="While you do acts of power for which we are not looking, and which have not come to the ears of men in the past.";
B._Isa64_4="The ear has not had news of, or the eye seen, ... any God but you, working for the man who is waiting for him.";
B._Isa64_5="Will you not have mercy on him who takes pleasure in doing righteousness, even on those who keep in mind your ways? Truly you were angry, and we went on doing evil, and sinning against you in the past.";
B._Isa64_6="For we have all become like an unclean person, and all our good acts are like a dirty robe: and we have all become old like a dead leaf, and our sins, like the wind, take us away.";
B._Isa64_7="And there is no one who makes prayer to your name, or who is moved to keep true to you: for your face is veiled from us, and you have given us into the power of our sins.";
B._Isa64_8="But now, O Lord, you are our father; we are the earth, and you are our maker; and we are all the work of your hand.";
B._Isa64_9="Be not very angry, O Lord, and do not keep our sins in mind for ever: give ear to our prayer, for we are all your people.";
B._Isa64_10="Your holy towns have become a waste, Zion has become a waste, Jerusalem is a mass of broken walls.";
B._Isa64_11="Our holy and beautiful house, where our fathers gave praise to you, is burned with fire; and all the things of our desire have come to destruction.";
B._Isa64_12="In view of all this, will you still do nothing, O Lord? will you keep quiet, and go on increasing our punishment?";
B._Isa65_1="I have been ready to give an answer to those who did not make prayer to me; I have been offering myself to those who were not searching for me; I said, Here am I, here am I, to a nation which gave no respect to my name.";
B._Isa65_2="All day my hands have been stretched out to an uncontrolled people, who go in an evil way, after the purposes of their hearts;";
B._Isa65_3="A people who make me angry every day, making offerings in gardens, and burning perfumes on bricks.";
B._Isa65_4="Who are seated in the resting-places of the dead, and by night are in the secret places; who take pig's flesh for food, and have the liquid of disgusting things in their vessels.";
B._Isa65_5="Who say, Keep away, do not come near me, for fear that I make you holy: these are a smoke in my nose, a fire burning all day.";
B._Isa65_6="See, it is recorded before me, says the Lord: I will not keep back my hand, till I have sent punishment,";
B._Isa65_7="For their sins and the sins of their fathers, who were burning perfumes on the mountains, and saying evil things against me on the hills: so I will take the measure of their sins, and will send the punishment for them into their breast.";
B._Isa65_8="This is the word of the Lord: As the new wine is seen in the grapes, and they say, Do not send destruction on it, for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants, in order that I may not put an end to them all.";
B._Isa65_9="And I will take a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah one who will have my mountains for a heritage: and the people I have taken to be mine will have it for themselves, and my servants will have their resting-place there.";
B._Isa65_10="And Sharon will be a grass-land for the flocks, and the valley of Achor a resting-place for the herds: for my people whose hearts have been turned back to me.";
B._Isa65_11="But as for you who have given up the Lord, who have no care for my holy mountain, who get ready a table for Chance, and make offerings of mixed wine to Fate;";
B._Isa65_12="Your fate will be the sword, and you will all go down to death: because when my voice came to you, you made no answer; you did not give ear to my word; but you did what was evil in my eyes, desiring what was not pleasing to me.";
B._Isa65_13="For this cause says the Lord God, My servants will have food, but you will be in need of food: my servants will have drink, but you will be dry: my servants will have joy, but you will be shamed:";
B._Isa65_14="My servants will make songs in the joy of their hearts, but you will be crying for sorrow, and making sounds of grief from a broken spirit.";
B._Isa65_15="And your name will become a curse to my people, and the Lord God will put you to death, and give his servants another name:";
B._Isa65_16="So that he who is requesting a blessing will make use of the name of the true God, and he who takes an oath will do so by the true God; because the past troubles are gone out of mind, and because they are covered from my eyes.";
B._Isa65_17="For see, I am making a new heaven and a new earth: and the past things will be gone completely out of mind.";
B._Isa65_18="But men will be glad and have joy for ever in what I am making; for I am making Jerusalem a delight, and her people a joy.";
B._Isa65_19="And I will be glad over Jerusalem, and have joy in my people: and the voice of weeping will no longer be sounding in her, or the voice of grief.";
B._Isa65_20="No longer will there be there a child whose days are cut short, or an old man whose days have not come to their full measure: for the young man at his death will be a hundred years old, and he whose life is shorter than a hundred years will seem as one cursed.";
B._Isa65_21="And they will be building houses and living in them; planting vine-gardens and getting the fruit of them.";
B._Isa65_22="They will no longer be building for the use of others, or planting for others to have the fruit: for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree, and my loved ones will have joy in full measure in the work of their hands.";
B._Isa65_23="Their work will not be for nothing, and they will not give birth to children for destruction; for they are a seed to whom the Lord has given his blessing, and their offspring will be with them.";
