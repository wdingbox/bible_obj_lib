B._Luk22_32="But I have made prayer for you, that your faith may not go from you: and when you are turned again, make your brothers strong.";
B._Luk22_33="And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.";
B._Luk22_34="And he said, I say to you, Peter, before the cock's second cry today, you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me.";
B._Luk22_35="And he said to them, When I sent you out without money or bag or shoes, were you in need of anything? And they said, Nothing.";
B._Luk22_36="And he said to them, But now, he who has a money-bag, or a bag for food, let him take it: and he who has not, let him give his coat for money and get a sword.";
B._Luk22_37="For I say to you that these words will be put into effect in me, And he was numbered among the evil-doers: for what has been said in the Writings about me has an end.";
B._Luk22_38="And they said, Lord, here are two swords. And he said, It is enough.";
B._Luk22_39="And he came out, and went, as his way was, to the Mountain of Olives, and the disciples went with him.";
B._Luk22_40="And when he came to the place, he said to them, Make a prayer that you may not be put to the test.";
B._Luk22_41="And he went a little distance away from them and, falling on his knees in prayer, he said,";
B._Luk22_42="Father, if it is your pleasure, take this cup from me: but still, let your pleasure, not mine, be done.";
B._Luk22_43="And an angel from heaven came to him, to give him strength.";
B._Luk22_44="And being in great trouble of soul, the force of his prayer became stronger, and great drops, like blood, came from him, falling to the earth.";
B._Luk22_45="And, getting up from prayer, he came to the disciples, and saw that they were sleeping for sorrow.";
B._Luk22_46="And he said, Why are you sleeping? Get up, and give yourselves to prayer, so that you may not be put to the test.";
B._Luk22_47="And while he was saying these words, there came a band of people, and Judas, one of the twelve, was in front of them, and he came near to Jesus to give him a kiss.";
B._Luk22_48="But Jesus said to him, Judas, will you be false to the Son of man with a kiss?";
B._Luk22_49="And when those who were with him saw what was coming, they said, Lord, may we not make use of our swords?";
B._Luk22_50="And one of them gave a blow to the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.";
B._Luk22_51="But Jesus, answering, said, Put up with this, at least. And touching his ear, he made it well.";
B._Luk22_52="And Jesus said to the chief priests and the captains of the Temple and the rulers, who had come against him, Have you come out as against a thief, with swords and sticks?";
B._Luk22_53="When I was in the Temple with you every day, your hands were not stretched out against me: but this is your hour, and the authority of the dark power.";
B._Luk22_54="And they made him a prisoner and took him away to the house of the high priest. But Peter went after them at a distance.";
B._Luk22_55="And a fire was lighted in the middle of the open square, and they were seated together, and Peter was among them.";
B._Luk22_56="And a certain woman-servant, seeing him in the light of the fire, and looking at him with attention, said, This man was with him.";
B._Luk22_57="But he said, Woman, it is not true; I have no knowledge of him.";
B._Luk22_58="And after a little time, another saw him and said, You are one of them; and he said, Man, I am not.";
B._Luk22_59="And after about an hour, another man said, with decision, Certainly this man was with him, for he is a Galilaean.";
B._Luk22_60="And Peter said, Man, I have no knowledge of these things of which you are talking. And straight away, while he was saying these words, there came the cry of a cock.";
B._Luk22_61="And the Lord, turning, gave Peter a look. And the words of the Lord came to Peter's mind, how he had said, This night, before the hour of the cock's cry, you will be false to me three times.";
B._Luk22_62="And he went out, weeping bitterly.";
B._Luk22_63="And the men in whose hands Jesus was, made sport of him and gave him blows.";
B._Luk22_64="And, covering his eyes, they said to him, Are you prophet enough to say who gave you that blow?";
B._Luk22_65="And they said a number of other evil things against him.";
B._Luk22_66="And when it was day, the rulers of the people came together, with the chief priests and the scribes, and they took him before their Sanhedrin, saying,";
B._Luk22_67="If you are the Christ, say so. But he said, If I say so you will not have belief;";
B._Luk22_68="And if I put a question to you, you will not give an answer.";
B._Luk22_69="But in the future the Son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.";
B._Luk22_70="And they all said, Are you then the Son of God? and he said, You say that I am.";
B._Luk22_71="And they said, What more need have we of witness? we have the very words of his mouth.";
B._Luk23_1="And they all went and took him before Pilate.";
B._Luk23_2="And they made statements against him, saying, This man has to our knowledge been teaching our nation to do wrong, and not to make payment of taxes to Caesar, even saying that he himself is Christ, a king.";
B._Luk23_3="And Pilate said to him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he said in answer, You say so.";
B._Luk23_4="And Pilate said to the chief priests and the people, In my opinion this man has done no wrong.";
B._Luk23_5="But they became more violent than before, saying, He has made trouble among the people, teaching through all Judaea from Galilee to this place.";
B._Luk23_6="But at these words Pilate said, Is the man a Galilaean?";
B._Luk23_7="And when he saw that he was under the authority of Herod, he sent him to Herod, who was in Jerusalem himself at that time.";
B._Luk23_8="Now when Herod saw Jesus he was very glad, having for a long time had a desire to see him, for he had had accounts of him, and was hoping to see some wonders done by him.";
B._Luk23_9="And he put a great number of questions to him, but he said nothing.";
B._Luk23_10="And the chief priests and the scribes were there, making statements against him violently.";
B._Luk23_11="And Herod, with the men of his army, put shame on him and made sport of him, and dressing him in shining robes, he sent him back to Pilate.";
B._Luk23_12="And that day Herod and Pilate became friends with one another, for before they had been against one another.";
B._Luk23_13="And Pilate sent for the chief priests and the rulers and the people, and said to them,";
B._Luk23_14="You say that this man has been teaching the people evil things: now I, after going into the question before you, see nothing wrong in this man in connection with the things which you have said against him:";
B._Luk23_15="And Herod is of the same opinion, for he has sent him back to us; for, you see, he has done nothing for which I might put him to death.";
B._Luk23_16="And so I will give him punishment and let him go.";
B._Luk23_17="[]";
B._Luk23_18="But with loud voices they said all together, Put this man to death, and make Barabbas free.";
B._Luk23_19="Now this man was in prison because of an attack against the government in the town, in which there had been loss of life.";
B._Luk23_20="And Pilate again said to them that it was his desire to let Jesus go free.";
B._Luk23_21="But crying out they said, To the cross with him!";
B._Luk23_22="And he said to them a third time, Why, what evil has he done? I see no reason for putting him to death: I will give him punishment and let him go.";
B._Luk23_23="But they went on crying out loudly, Let him be put to death on the cross. And they had their way.";
B._Luk23_24="And Pilate gave his decision for their desire to be put into effect.";
B._Luk23_25="And in answer to their request, he let that man go free who had been in prison for acting against the government and causing death, and Jesus he gave up to their pleasure.";
B._Luk23_26="And while they were taking him away, they put their hands on Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and made him take the cross after Jesus.";
B._Luk23_27="And a great band of people went after him, and of women making signs of grief and weeping for him.";
B._Luk23_28="But Jesus, turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, let not your weeping be for me, but for yourselves and for your children.";
B._Luk23_29="For the days are coming in which they will say, Happy are those who have had no children, whose bodies have never given birth, whose breasts have never given milk.";
B._Luk23_30="And they will say to the mountains, Come down on us, and to the hills, Be a cover over us.";
B._Luk23_31="For if they do these things when the tree is green, what will they do when it is dry?";
B._Luk23_32="And two others, evil-doers, were taken with him to be put to death.";
B._Luk23_33="And when they came to the place which is named Golgotha, they put him on the cross, and the evil-doers, one on the right side, and the other on the left.";
B._Luk23_34="And Jesus said, Father, let them have forgiveness, for they have no knowledge of what they are doing. And they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance.";
B._Luk23_35="And the people were looking on. And the rulers made sport of him, saying, He was a saviour of others; let him do something for himself, if he is the Christ, the man of God's selection.";
B._Luk23_36="And the men of the army made sport of him, coming to him and giving him bitter wine,";
B._Luk23_37="And saying, If you are the King of the Jews, get yourself free.";
B._Luk23_38="And these words were put in writing over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.";
B._Luk23_39="And one of the evil-doers on the cross, with bitter feeling, said to him, Are you not the Christ? Get yourself and us out of this.";
B._Luk23_40="But the other, protesting, said, Have you no fear of God? for you have a part in the same punishment,";
B._Luk23_41="And with reason; for we have the right reward of our acts, but this man has done nothing wrong.";
B._Luk23_42="And he said, Jesus, keep me in mind when you come in your kingdom.";
B._Luk23_43="And he said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you will be with me in Paradise.";
B._Luk23_44="And it was now about the sixth hour; and all the land was dark till the ninth hour;";
B._Luk23_45="The light of the sun went out, and the curtain in the Temple was parted in two.";
B._Luk23_46="And Jesus gave a loud cry and said, Father, into your hands I give my spirit: and when he had said this, he gave up his spirit.";
B._Luk23_47="And when the captain saw what was done, he gave praise to God, saying, Without doubt this was an upright man.";
B._Luk23_48="And all the people who had come together to see it, when they saw the things which were done, went back again making signs of grief.";
B._Luk23_49="And all his friends and the women who came with him from Galilee, were waiting at a distance, watching these things.";
B._Luk23_50="Now there was a man named Joseph, a man of authority and a good and upright man";
B._Luk23_51="(He had not given his approval to their decision or their acts), of Arimathaea, a town of the Jews, who was waiting for the kingdom of God:";
B._Luk23_52="This man went to Pilate and made a request for the body of Jesus.";
B._Luk23_53="And he took it down, and folding it in a linen cloth, he put it in a place cut in the rock for a dead body; and no one had ever been put in it.";
B._Luk23_54="Now it was the day of making ready and the Sabbath was coming on.";
B._Luk23_55="And the women who had come with him from Galilee went after him and saw the place and how his body had been put to rest;";
B._Luk23_56="And they went back and got ready spices and perfumes; and on the Sabbath they took their rest, in agreement with the law.";
B._Luk24_1="But on the first day of the week, at dawn, they came to the place where his body had been put, taking the spices which they had got ready.";
B._Luk24_2="And they saw that the stone had been rolled away.";
B._Luk24_3="And they went in, but the body of the Lord Jesus was not there.";
B._Luk24_4="And while they were in doubt about it, they saw two men in shining clothing by them:";
B._Luk24_5="And while their faces were bent down to the earth in fear, these said to them, Why are you looking for the living among the dead?";
B._Luk24_6="He is not here, he has come back to life: have in mind what he said to you when he was still in Galilee, saying,";
B._Luk24_7="The Son of man will be given up into the hands of evil-doers, and be put to death on the cross, and on the third day he will come back to life.";
B._Luk24_8="And his words came back into their minds,";
B._Luk24_9="And they went away from that place and gave an account of all these things to the eleven disciples and all the others.";
B._Luk24_10="Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary, the mother of James: and the other women with them said these things to the Apostles.";
B._Luk24_11="But these words seemed foolish to them, and they had no belief in them.";
B._Luk24_12="But Peter got up and went to the place where the body had been put, and looking in he saw nothing but the linen cloths, and he went to his house full of wonder at what had taken place.";
B._Luk24_13="And then, two of them, on that very day, were going to a little town named Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.";
B._Luk24_14="And they were talking together about all those things which had taken place.";
B._Luk24_15="And while they were talking and questioning together, Jesus himself came near and went with them.";
B._Luk24_16="But their eyes were not open that they might have knowledge of him.";
B._Luk24_17="And he said to them, What are you talking about together while you go?";
B._Luk24_18="Then stopping, and looking sadly at him, one of them, named Cleopas, said to him, Are you the only man living in Jerusalem who has not had news of the things which have taken place there at this time?";
B._Luk24_19="And he said to them, What things? And they said, The things to do with Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, great in his acts and his words, before God and all the people:";
B._Luk24_20="And how the chief priests and our rulers gave him up to be put to death on the cross.";
B._Luk24_21="But we were hoping that he would be the Saviour of Israel. In addition to all this he has now let three days go by from the time when these things took place;";
B._Luk24_22="And certain women among us gave us cause for wonder, for they went early to the place where his body had been put,";
B._Luk24_23="And it was not there; then they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he was living.";
B._Luk24_24="And some of those who were with us went to the place, and saw that it was as the women had said, but him they did not see.";
B._Luk24_25="And he said, O foolish men! how slow you are to give belief to what the prophets have said.";
B._Luk24_26="Was it not necessary for the Christ to go through these things, and to come into his glory?";
B._Luk24_27="And he made clear to them all the things in the Writings, from Moses and from all the prophets, which had to do with himself.";
B._Luk24_28="And they came near the town to which they were going, and he seemed as if he was going on;";
B._Luk24_29="But they kept him back, saying, Do not go, for evening is near, the day is almost gone. And he went in with them.";
B._Luk24_30="And when he was seated with them at table, he took the bread, and said words of blessing and, making division of it, he gave it to them.";
B._Luk24_31="And then their eyes were open, and they had knowledge of him, but he went from their view.";
B._Luk24_32="And they said to one another, Were not our hearts burning in us while he was talking to us on the way, making clear to us the holy Writings?";
B._Luk24_33="And that very hour they got up and went back to Jerusalem, where the eleven and the others had come together.";
B._Luk24_34="And they said to them, The Lord has truly come back to life again, and Simon has seen him.";
B._Luk24_35="And they gave an account of the things which had taken place on the way, and how, when he gave them bread, they had knowledge of him.";
B._Luk24_36="And while they were saying these things, he himself was among them, and said to them, Peace be with you!";
B._Luk24_37="But they were full of fear, being of the opinion that they were seeing a spirit.";
B._Luk24_38="And he said to them, Why are you troubled, and why are your hearts full of doubt?";
B._Luk24_39="See; my hands and my feet: it is I myself; put your hands on me and make certain; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have.";
B._Luk24_40="And when he had said this, he let them see his hands and his feet.";
B._Luk24_41="And because, for joy and wonder, they were still in doubt, he said to them, Have you any food here?";
B._Luk24_42="And they gave him a bit of cooked fish.";
B._Luk24_43="And before their eyes he took a meal.";
B._Luk24_44="And he said to them, These are the words which I said to you when I was still with you, how it was necessary for all the things which are in the writings of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms about me, to be put into effect.";
B._Luk24_45="Then he made the holy Writings clear to their minds.";
B._Luk24_46="And he said to them, So it is in the Writings that the Christ would undergo death, and come back to life again on the third day;";
B._Luk24_47="And that teaching about a change of heart and forgiveness of sins is to be given to Jerusalem first and to all nations in his name.";
B._Luk24_48="You are witnesses of these things.";
B._Luk24_49="And now I will send to you what my father has undertaken to give you, but do not go from the town, till the power from heaven comes to you.";
B._Luk24_50="And he took them out till they were near Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he gave them a blessing.";
B._Luk24_51="And while he was doing so, he went from them and was taken up into heaven.";
B._Luk24_52="And they gave him worship and went back to Jerusalem with great joy.";
B._Luk24_53="And they were in the Temple at all times, giving praise to God.";
B._Jhn1_1="From the first he was the Word, and the Word was in relation with God and was God.";
B._Jhn1_2="This Word was from the first in relation with God.";
B._Jhn1_3="All things came into existence through him, and without him nothing was.";
B._Jhn1_4="What came into existence in him was life, and the life was the light of men.";
B._Jhn1_5="And the light goes on shining in the dark; it is not overcome by the dark.";
B._Jhn1_6="There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.";
B._Jhn1_7="He came for witness, to give witness about the light, so that all men might have faith through him.";
B._Jhn1_8="He himself was not the light: he was sent to give witness about the light.";
B._Jhn1_9="The true light, which gives light to every man, was then coming into the world.";
B._Jhn1_10="He was in the world, the world which came into being through him, but the world had no knowledge of him.";
B._Jhn1_11="He came to the things which were his and his people did not take him to their hearts.";
B._Jhn1_12="To all those who did so take him, however, he gave the right of becoming children of God--that is, to those who had faith in his name:";
B._Jhn1_13="Whose birth was from God and not from blood, or from an impulse of the flesh and man's desire.";
B._Jhn1_14="And so the Word became flesh and took a place among us for a time; and we saw his glory--such glory as is given to an only son by his father--saw it to be true and full of grace.";
B._Jhn1_15="John gave witness about him, crying, This is he of whom I said, He who is coming after me is put over me because he was in existence before me.";
B._Jhn1_16="From his full measure we have all been given grace on grace.";
B._Jhn1_17="For the law was given through Moses; grace and the true way of life are ours through Jesus Christ.";
B._Jhn1_18="No man has seen God at any time; the only Son, who is on the breast of the Father, he has made clear what God is.";
B._Jhn1_19="And this is the witness of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to him with the question, Who are you?";
B._Jhn1_20="He said quite openly and straightforwardly, I am not the Christ.";
B._Jhn1_21="And they said to him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the prophet? And his answer was, I am not.";
B._Jhn1_22="So they said to him, Who are you then? We have to give some answer to those who sent us. What have you to say about yourself?";
B._Jhn1_23="He said, I am the voice of one crying in the waste land, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.";
B._Jhn1_24="Those who had been sent came from the Pharisees.";
B._Jhn1_25="And they put this question to him, saying, Why then are you giving baptism if you are not the Christ, or Elijah, or the prophet?";
B._Jhn1_26="John's answer was: I give baptism with water; but there is one among you of whom you have no knowledge;";
B._Jhn1_27="It is he who is coming after me; I am not good enough to undo his shoes.";
B._Jhn1_28="These things took place at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was giving baptism.";
B._Jhn1_29="The day after, John sees Jesus coming to him and says, See, here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!";
B._Jhn1_30="This is he of whom I said, One is coming after me who is put over me because he was in existence before me.";
B._Jhn1_31="I myself had no knowledge of him, but I came giving baptism with water so that he might be seen openly by Israel.";
B._Jhn1_32="And John gave this witness, saying, I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove and resting on him.";
B._Jhn1_33="I had no knowledge who he was, but he who sent me to give baptism with water said to me, The one on whom you see the Spirit coming down and resting, it is he who gives baptism with the Holy Spirit.";
B._Jhn1_34="This I saw myself and my witness is that he is the Son of God.";
B._Jhn1_35="The day after, John was there again with two of his disciples;";
B._Jhn1_36="And looking at Jesus while he was walking he said, See, there is the Lamb of God!";
B._Jhn1_37="Hearing what he said, the two disciples went after Jesus.";
B._Jhn1_38="And Jesus, turning round, saw them coming after him and said to them, What are you looking for? They said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, Master), where are you living?";
B._Jhn1_39="He said to them, Come and see. They went with him then and saw where he was living; and they were with him all that day: it was then about the tenth hour of the day.";
B._Jhn1_40="Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two men who, hearing what John said, went after Jesus.";
B._Jhn1_41="Early in the morning he came across his brother and said to him, We have made discovery! It is the Messiah! (which is to say, the Christ).";
B._Jhn1_42="And he took him to Jesus. Looking at him fixedly Jesus said, You are Simon, the son of John; your name will be Cephas (which is to say, Peter).";
B._Jhn1_43="The day after this, Jesus had a desire to go into Galilee. He came across Philip and said to him, Come and be my disciple.";
B._Jhn1_44="Now Philip's town was Beth-saida, where Andrew and Peter came from.";
B._Jhn1_45="Philip came across Nathanael and said to him, We have made a discovery! It is he of whom Moses, in the law, and the prophets were writing, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.";
B._Jhn1_46="Nazareth! said Nathanael, Is it possible for any good to come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.";
B._Jhn1_47="Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said of him, See, here is a true son of Israel in whom there is nothing false.";
B._Jhn1_48="Nathanael said to him, Where did you get knowledge of me? In answer Jesus said, Before Philip was talking with you, while you were still under the fig-tree, I saw you.";
B._Jhn1_49="Nathanael said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel!";
B._Jhn1_50="In answer Jesus said to him, You have faith because I said to you, I saw you under the fig-tree. You will see greater things than these.";
B._Jhn1_51="And he said to him, Truly I say to you all, You will see heaven opening and God's angels going up and coming down on the Son of man.";
B._Jhn2_1="On the third day two people were going to be married at Cana in Galilee. The mother of Jesus was there:";
B._Jhn2_2="And Jesus with his disciples came as guests.";
B._Jhn2_3="When they had not enough wine, the mother of Jesus said to him, They have no wine.";
B._Jhn2_4="Jesus said to her, Woman, this is not your business; my time is still to come.";
B._Jhn2_5="His mother said to the servants, Whatever he says to you, do it.";
B._Jhn2_6="Now six pots of stone, every one taking two or three firkins of water, were placed there for the purpose of washing, as is the way of the Jews.";
B._Jhn2_7="Jesus said to the servants, Make the pots full of water. And they made them full to the top.";
