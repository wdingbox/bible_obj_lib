B._Luk2_9="And an angel of the Lord came to them, and the glory of the Lord was shining round about them: and fear came on them.";
B._Luk2_10="And the angel said, Have no fear; for truly, I give you good news of great joy which will be for all the people:";
B._Luk2_11="For on this day, in the town of David, a Saviour has come to birth, who is Christ the Lord.";
B._Luk2_12="And this is the sign to you: you will see a young child folded in linen, in the place where the cattle have their food.";
B._Luk2_13="And suddenly there was with the angel a great band of spirits from heaven, giving praise to God, and saying,";
B._Luk2_14="Glory to God in the highest, and on the earth peace among men with whom he is well pleased.";
B._Luk2_15="And when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the keepers of the sheep said to one another, Let us go now to Beth-lehem, and see this thing which has come about, which the Lord has made clear to us.";
B._Luk2_16="And they came quickly, and saw Mary and Joseph, and the child in the place where the cattle had their food.";
B._Luk2_17="And when they saw it, they gave them an account of the things which had been said to them about the child.";
B._Luk2_18="And all those to whose ears it came were full of wonder at the things said by the keepers of the sheep.";
B._Luk2_19="But Mary kept all these words in her heart, and gave much thought to them.";
B._Luk2_20="Then the keepers of the sheep went back, giving glory and praise to God for all the things which had come to their ears and which they had seen, as it had been said to them.";
B._Luk2_21="And when, after eight days, the time came for his circumcision, he was named Jesus, the name which the angel had given to him before his birth.";

B._Luk2_26="And he had knowledge, through the Holy Spirit, that he would not see death till he had seen the Lord's Christ.";
B._Luk2_27="And full of the Spirit he came into the Temple; and when the father and mother came in with the child Jesus, to do with him what was ordered by the law,";
B._Luk2_28="Then he took him in his arms and gave praise to God and said,";
B._Luk2_29="Now you are letting your servant go in peace, O Lord, as you have said;";
B._Luk2_30="For my eyes have seen your salvation,";
B._Luk2_31="Which you have made ready before the face of all nations;";

B._Luk2_33="And his father and mother were full of wonder at the things which were said about him.";
B._Luk2_34="And Simeon gave them his blessing and said to Mary, his mother, See, this child will be the cause of the downfall and the lifting up of great numbers of people in Israel, and he will be a sign against which hard words will be said;";
B._Luk2_35="(And a sword will go through your heart;) so that the secret thoughts of men may come to light.";
B._Luk2_36="And there was one, Anna, a woman prophet, the daughter of Phanuel, of the family of Asher (she was very old, and after seven years of married life";
B._Luk2_37="She had been a widow for eighty-four years); she was in the Temple at all times, worshipping with prayers and going without food, night and day.";
B._Luk2_38="And coming up at that time, she gave praise to God, talking of him to all those who were waiting for the freeing of Jerusalem.";
B._Luk2_39="And when they had done all the things which were ordered by the law of the Lord, they went back to Galilee, to Nazareth, the town where they were living.";

B._Luk2_44="And in the belief that he was with some of their number, they went a day's journey; and after looking for him among their relations and friends,";
B._Luk2_45="And seeing that he was not there, they went back to Jerusalem, to make search for him.";
B._Luk2_46="And after three days they came across him in the Temple, seated among the wise men, giving ear to their words and putting questions to them.";
B._Luk2_47="And all to whose ears it came were full of wonder at his knowledge and the answers which he gave.";
B._Luk2_48="And when they saw him they were surprised, and his mother said to him, Son, why have you done this to us? see, your father and I have been looking for you with sorrow.";
B._Luk2_49="And he said to them, Why were you looking for me? was it not clear to you that my right place was in my Father's house?";
B._Luk2_50="And his words seemed strange to them.";

B._Luk3_12="Then tax-farmers came to him for baptism and said to him, Master, what have we to do?";
B._Luk3_13="And he said to them, Do not make an attempt to get more money than the right amount.";
B._Luk3_14="And men of the army put questions to him, saying, And what have we to do? And he said to them, Do no violent acts to any man, and do not take anything without right, and let your payment be enough for you.";
B._Luk3_15="And while the people were waiting, and all men were questioning in their hearts about John, if he was the Christ or not,";
B._Luk3_16="John made answer, saying to them all, Truly, I give you baptism with water, but one is coming who is greater than I, whose shoes I am not good enough to undo: he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit, and with fire:";

B._Luk4_44="And he was teaching in the Synagogues of Galilee.";
B._Luk5_1="Now it came about that while the people came pushing to be near him, and to have knowledge of the word of God, he was by a wide stretch of water named Gennesaret;";
B._Luk5_2="And he saw two boats by the edge of the water, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.";
B._Luk5_3="And he got into one of the boats, the property of Simon, and made a request to him to go a little way out from the land. And being seated he gave the people teaching from the boat.";
B._Luk5_4="And when his talk was ended, he said to Simon, Go out into deep water, and let down your nets for fish.";
B._Luk5_5="And Simon, answering, said, Master, we were working all night and we took nothing: but at your word I will let down the nets.";
B._Luk5_6="And when they had done this, they got such a great number of fish that it seemed as if their nets would be broken;";
B._Luk5_7="And they made signs to their friends in the other boat to come to their help. And they came, and the two boats were so full that they were going down.";
B._Luk5_8="But Simon, when he saw it, went down at the knees of Jesus and said, Go away from me, O Lord, for I am a sinner.";
B._Luk5_9="For he was full of wonder and so were all those who were with him, at the number of fish which they had taken;";
B._Luk5_10="And so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were working with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Have no fear; from this time forward you will be a fisher of men.";
B._Luk5_11="And when they had got their boats to the land, they gave up everything and went after him.";
B._Luk5_12="And it came about that while he was in one of the towns, there was a leper there: and when he saw Jesus he went down on his face in prayer to him, saying, Lord, if it is your pleasure, you have power to make me clean.";
B._Luk5_13="And he put out his hand to him and said, It is my pleasure; be clean. And straight away his disease went from him.";
B._Luk5_14="And he gave him orders: Say nothing to any man, but let the priest see you and give an offering so that you may be made clean, as the law of Moses says, and for a witness to them.";
B._Luk5_15="But news of him went out all the more, in every direction, and great numbers of people came together to give hearing to his words and to be made well from their diseases.";
B._Luk5_16="But he went away by himself to a waste place for prayer.";
B._Luk5_17="And it came about that on one of these days he was teaching; and some Pharisees and teachers of the law were seated there, who had come from every town of Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was with him, to make those who were ill free from their diseases.";
B._Luk5_18="And some men had with them, on a bed, a man who was ill, without power of moving; and they made attempts to get him in and put him before Jesus.";
B._Luk5_19="And because of the mass of people, there was no way to get him in; so they went up on the top of the house and let him down through the roof, on his bed, into the middle in front of Jesus.";
B._Luk5_20="And seeing their faith he said, Man, you have forgiveness for your sins.";
B._Luk5_21="And the scribes and Pharisees were having an argument, saying, Who is this, who has no respect for God? who is able to give forgiveness for sins, but God only?";
B._Luk5_22="But Jesus, who had knowledge of their thoughts, said to them, Why are you reasoning in your hearts?";
B._Luk5_23="Which is the simpler: to say, You have forgiveness for your sins; or to say, Get up and go?";
B._Luk5_24="But so that you may see that on earth the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins, (he said to the man who was ill,) I say to you, Get up, and take up your bed, and go into your house.";
B._Luk5_25="And straight away he got up before them, and took up his bed and went away to his house giving praise to God.";
B._Luk5_26="And wonder overcame them all, and they gave glory to God; and they were full of fear, saying, We have seen strange things today.";
B._Luk5_27="And after these things he went out, and saw Levi, a tax-farmer, seated at the place where taxes were taken, and said to him, Come after me.";
B._Luk5_28="And giving up his business, he got up and went after him.";
B._Luk5_29="And Levi made a great feast for him in his house: and a great number of tax-farmers and others were seated at table with them.";
B._Luk5_30="And the Pharisees and their scribes made protests against his disciples, saying, Why do you take food and drink with tax-farmers and sinners?";
B._Luk5_31="And Jesus, answering, said to them, Those who are well have no need of a medical man, but those who are ill.";
B._Luk5_32="I have come, not to get the upright, but sinners, so that they may be turned from their sins.";
B._Luk5_33="And they said to him, The disciples of John frequently go without food, and make prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees; but your disciples take food and drink.";
B._Luk5_34="And Jesus said, Are you able to make the friends of the newly-married man go without food when he is with them?";
B._Luk5_35="But the days will come when he will be taken away from them, and then they will go without food.";
B._Luk5_36="And he said to them, in a story, No man takes a bit of cloth from a new coat and puts it on to an old coat, for so the new coat would be damaged and the bit from the new would not go well with the old.";
B._Luk5_37="And no man puts new wine into old wine-skins, for fear that the skins will be burst by the new wine, and the wine be let out, and the skins come to destruction.";
B._Luk5_38="But new wine has to be put into new wine-skins.";
B._Luk5_39="And no man, having had old wine, has any desire for new, for he says, The old is better.";
B._Luk6_1="Now it came about that on the Sabbath he was going through the fields of grain, and his disciples took the heads of the grain for food, crushing them in their hands.";
B._Luk6_2="But some of the Pharisees said, Why do you do what it is not right to do on the Sabbath?";
B._Luk6_3="And Jesus said, Have you not seen in the Writings what David did when he was in need of food, he, and those who were with him;";
B._Luk6_4="How he went into the house of God and took for food the holy bread, which only the priests may take, and gave it to those who were with him?";
B._Luk6_5="And he said, The Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath.";
B._Luk6_6="And it came about, on another Sabbath, that he went into the Synagogue and was teaching there. And a man was there whose right hand was dead.";
B._Luk6_7="And the scribes and Pharisees were watching him to see if he would make him well on the Sabbath, so that they might be able to say something against him.";
B._Luk6_8="But he had knowledge of their thoughts; and he said to the man whose hand was dead, Get up and come into the middle. And he got up and came forward.";
B._Luk6_9="And Jesus said, I put the question to you, Is it right to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil? to give life or to take it away?";
B._Luk6_10="And looking round on all of them, he said to him, Put out your hand. And he did so: and his hand was made well.";
B._Luk6_11="But they were full of wrath, and were talking together about what they might do to Jesus.";
B._Luk6_12="And it came about in those days that he went out to the mountain for prayer; and he was all night in prayer to God.";
B._Luk6_13="And the day came and, turning to his disciples, he made a selection from among them of twelve, to whom he gave the name of Apostles;";
